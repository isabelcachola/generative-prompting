While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. 
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. 
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it. 
It doesn't have to happen to us. 
Really powerful dynamic. 
And in our studies, what we’ve been able to do is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost -- and in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be. 
(Laughter) This is the spectrum of the Sun -- 24,000 spectral lines, and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified. 
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger. 
Three, they allow you to go deeper. 
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies, and the occasions when it works they will publish, and the ones where it doesn't work they won't. 
And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher. 
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug. 
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics, but also in a whole range of human endeavors. 
So we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with savings eventually. 
It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high fructose corn syrup, the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. 
Some of the other things that they need we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is. 
Since I was a boy, in my early childhood, I always wanted to be a musician, and, thank God, I made it. 
"What are we going to do with these boys?" 
There's another very interesting connection here, and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system. 
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. 
Why hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter) So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter) So in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache, so we renamed the month of November "Movember" and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today. 
So I thought, forget the rock opera, forget the bombast, my usual tricks. 
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store, actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money. 
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. 
And if you think about it, it's the history of industrial agriculture. 
Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react? 
We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here, but we're getting all this amazing stuff. 
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor. 
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't. 
This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year, not to mention the impact on all of us: stress, inconvenience, missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. 
Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists. 
I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science. 
So the chips are candied, the ground beef is made from chocolate, and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese. 
We use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see. 
The final one I want to talk about -- and it's a great one to end on -- is this concept of communal discovery, a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something. 
So why don't we think of using some of this aid? 
All that costs money. 
So she did that for two more months. 
And she talked about how technology with these new feathers, this new face paint, this punk, the way that we identify with the world, and we made this music video. 
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular. 
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives. 
This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya. 
So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. 
This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain. 
Sit down and care. 
Of course that means that architecture is political. 
I would like to see Oracle take up that, or some other technological geniuses work on this. 
It starts with the global hubs. 
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy. 
And what did the Norden bombsight do? 
Let's imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads, but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached. 
(Applause) It's a small message from us, in our own small way to the enemies of humanity, of Islam, of South Asia, of India, and of Pakistan, that humanity will continue to bloom, irrespective of such dastardly attacks. 
I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. 
This is a private school. 
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs. 
Not much has changed. 
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?" 
You can see them in this footage. 
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. 
But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859, at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared, thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal, to which the whalers had not been paying attention. 
You go up in the short run, but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. 
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. 
In Moldova, young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers, and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions, young adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record, 14 percent were involved in prostitution, and 10 percent had taken their own lives. 
It's business anywhere. 
Actually, no. 
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome." 
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively. 
Now, let's actually learn something. 
Well actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four. 
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears. 
So, what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. 
And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said, "Wait a minute. 
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology, then the day after tomorrow, I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds. 
Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter via its mass and spin. 
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness. 
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals. 
(Laughter) I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying, "We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis." 
Bitches get beat daily. 
"No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry." 
(Laughter) It's been eight years, and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer. 
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. 
And what do we teach in these schools? 
I was covering the war in Afghanistan, and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera, the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. 
So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear. 
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?" 
But I did know the game was up. 
But that's enormously important for policy. 
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. 
Now I'm going to step back in history. 
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. 
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move. 
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city. 
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. 
We cut, we dry and we packed them, we mounted them on a folder. 
Really what I'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life. 
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed." 
The objects we use, the clothes we wear, the houses we live in, all have a profound impact on our behavior, health and quality of life. 
In the histogram before you now, the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures, going back about far as we have temperature data. 
And that's what we're doing in our cities: living here, working here, having leisure here. 
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative, but I find it rather poignant. 
When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, "That's what I want to be." 
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side. 
There was no metaphor. Was it a database? 
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project. 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. 
And then in paintbrushes, hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature. 
And then the most complex are the solid organs. 
Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way. 
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here, and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. 
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. 
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. 
And the war ended with a regime change, like the one in Afghanistan. 
BlueTooth, WiFi available -- beams back images to your eye. 
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this. 
And before I even knew it, I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally. 
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen, and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!" 
So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model, they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do, in a sense, what Britain did: make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there. 
Can you hear anything? 
Little, ring, middle, index. And then open. 
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock. 
These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton, and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground, they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands. 
And we managed to boil it down to nine. 
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet, whether it's 40 percent of our land surface, 70 percent of the water we use, 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions. 
And here's an example. 
That has got to be stopped. 
And all of a sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped, and you stared. It was creepy." (Laughter) This girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about. (Laughter) "And then you looked at the guy next to me, and you smiled, and you reached in your bucket, and you pulled out a lollipop, and you held it out to him, and you said, 'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you.'" And she said, "I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life. 
So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. 
It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations, the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of. 
We feel we're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the Studio School idea into something which is present, not as a universal answer for every child, but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world. 
Too many lives are at stake. 
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment. 
Anyway, I came back from Australia, and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen. 
He became a Jesuit. 
They actually tend to go a little risky. 
This stuff is produced biologically. 
Given the computer model, we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. 
I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt. 
That's really where innovation happens. 
These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. 
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury. 
This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power. 
And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable. 
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. 
And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. 
Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan. 
They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. 
But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. 
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had. 
Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them, so they can advise the president. 
Now this is in 1978. 
I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song. 
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship. 
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture, identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies, estimate how far away they are, and plot them up. 
I probably learned the most about relationships. 
We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities, in a certain sense. 
For instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself. 
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to. 
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier." 
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family. 
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing. 
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity, as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation. 
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. 
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation has a real world value. 
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries. 
Globalize trade. 
So let's go to step one. 
Normally when you look out into the universe, you're looking back in time. All right? 
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road? 
Especially the aisle with cleaning products. 
And /b/ is known for, more than anything, not just the memes they've created, but the exploits. 
Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place. 
The flickering, transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love. 
This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that. 
When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place, this outlet, where I can come after work and be myself." 
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment. 
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right, putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters. 
But guess what? 
And from the building in the back, you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills. 
Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world. 
We've heard from Bill Gates recently. 
I started studying kids about 15 years ago, -- so actually 20 years ago now -- and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology, and at first I thought, "My children are prodigies!" (Laughter) But then I noticed all their friends were like them, so that was a bad theory. 
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600. 
The institutional response is, I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great, that's what I'll do. 
(Applause) But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008. 
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure. 
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically. 
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide. 
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that, but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV, it was about ice caps melting, wars going on around the world, earthquakes, hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse, and then eventually did collapse, and so many of us losing our homes, or our jobs, or our retirements, or our livelihoods. 
And that's what's happening! 
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation. 
So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats. 
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world. 
When we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side-by-side, eventually we get to the point in the process that's fuzzy or unconventional. 
What have I heard during these last four days? 
Was it the planes or the volcano, the grounded planes or the volcano? 
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity. 
It's a living organism, cut the slice off, stuck it in a vase of water, it was all right for another two weeks after this. 
CA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance. 
And because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat. 
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large. 
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane. 
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions, motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. 
But you have to make the decision for yourself. 
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry? 
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. 
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. 
We're starting to cover this more and more. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22. 
(Applause) But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives -- not so much this issue of the 1980 convention -- the thing to think about is this: They go to church. 
From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation. 
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. 
We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail. 
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. 
Here's a more topical example of exactly the same thing. 
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four -- no, it's about two months from now -- to give a lecture. 
So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. 
If we can change the way households believe and think, we can change the way communities believe and think. 
Could we use the same model? 
(Applause) I'm a visual artist, and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. 
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension. 
And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey. 
Now if that were true, it's a true condemnation of our health care system, because they had been seen in other places. 
It's not because we have a lot of it. 
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. 
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11, because George Bush launched the War on Terror. 
Poor nutrition, access to water, climate change, deforestation, lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food, not enough healthcare, pollution. 
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. 
My psychosis, on the other hand, is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled. 
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. 
But through science, we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. 
(Singing) There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions. 
First of all, we have to have the right framework. 
(Laughter) Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. 
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. 
My goal of the design is not when it's completed. 
John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this -- nice guy besides -- and only been dead 200 years. 
In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches. 
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. 
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report" when they talk about new UI design. 
Take nothing: do no harm. 
In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you. 
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend," from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan. 
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview. 
But if you don't do that, if you allow for the accident to keep on happening, you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength. 
To weigh any more than that, it has to give up neurons. 
The winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is. 
He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him. 
When you go home, tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information, they don't have to do it. 
Suddenly, I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean -- schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface, coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful, large fish everywhere, manta rays. 
Spiders are truly global citizens. 
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey. 
It was a huge success. 
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals that are very, very tiny. 
And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine, but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there. 
It was a long process. 
Well how else can we create new ideas? 
And I suddenly got it, and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?" 
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. 
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in. 
That is not the job of the science of memetics. 
And it's truly awesome and wondrous. 
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. 
and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?" 
For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000 accessible books in Spanish. 
I asked her about that, and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married, because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman, your chances to live an independent life kind of end, and so she had no interest in that. 
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation. (Applause) One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people. 
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain. 
And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people. 
Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption, which is to get a bunch of stuff, is not, in fact, how we really live best in dense environments. 
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy, granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar, we will do it. 
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin. 
And let's do it soon. Thank you. 
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment. 
When does learning begin? 
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me. 
PH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later. 
They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. 
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen, and the show was quite transcendant, and it became a phenomenon in its own right. 
What a strange personality disorder we must have, counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. 
But there are only two rules. 
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him. 
And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer? 
But we all had to change, but not just react to the given; we bend to this new experience with intent. 
None of us, I think, want human progress to stop. 
Here it's an artist book installation called "Identity Project." 
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory, and every single one of them was authentic. 
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that. 
What are you into? Who are you into? 
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same. 
So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny, because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. 
(Laughter) But one of the great things about the search for massive primes, it's not just finding the primes. 
I'm not home, can't make family dinner? 
and it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference ... 
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming, excessive new access to pornography. 
There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing -- I hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions. 
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist. 
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing. 
And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. 
We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble, and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models. 
And so you can see, the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up. 
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. 
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means. 
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. 
So already you can see there are contradictions. 
So what should we do about it? 
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. 
That was one of the funnest moments of my career. 
In particular, the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different. 
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy. 
I want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work. 
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum. 
And what I can say is, in 2016, doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. 
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. 
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought. 
He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. 
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. 
(Music) "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal." 
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms? 
See it uncurl and then peel these toes. 
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk. 
But the painting reflects -- I don't think differently for children than I do for adults. 
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research. 
So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems. 
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. 
And do you guys just want to see it? 
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them, and in this case, the trickle-down effect, which does not work in economics, works perfectly. 
In Germany, we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant, but you are allowed to bribe a deputy. 
But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers. 
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine." 
It's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us. 
Now if you saw an apple do that, you'd want to know why. 
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited -- you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators 10 months from enrolling in the program. 
This is really important. You can't, like, wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. 
It would be so energizing and so empowering. 
Because, you see, this is the reality. 
There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it. (Laughter) And this happens constantly in the writing. 
And this is what happened. 
And when I underwent it and found solutions, this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth. 
Construction site in New York: red having this kind of emotional power that's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such. 
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother, whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles, especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police. 
And there's two things I do: When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other. 
But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape, rather than engulf it. 
It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol, put poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf. 
What do we learn from that? 
Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States, at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. 
I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups, less bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever. 
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy, as well as "Maestro," because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. 
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg. 
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves -- from health and education to the uses of force -- the organizers of the curriculum. 
It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud. 
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. 
I call this environmental arbitrage. 
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave. 
There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. 
This is the opposite of what we were built on: independence, self-sufficiency, autonomy. 
But I told him no, I'm sorry, compromise in colors is gray, and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime. 
So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn, glorified my school principal, put him right on top, and gifted it to him. 
SJ: Excellent, thank you. 
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. 
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure. 
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious. 
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. 
So then of the energy that does get to the wheels, only an eighth of it, half of that, goes to heat the tires on the road, or to heat the air the car pushes aside. 
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. 
Now, this robot is currently our star robot. 
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life. 
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics -- the key measurements of vital signs, and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. 
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. 
But it was -- did you hear? 
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. 
And now, out of the mythology of that, I'm starting to create a world. 
So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day, 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. 
The philosophy is very simple. 
Bluefin are warmblooded like us. 
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK. 
And this very encouraging story, I think, is partly demographic-led. 
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out. 
What is it made of? 
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit. 
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find. 
These are also, these tar-fueled protocells, are also able to locate resources in their environment. 
From that day on, we never closed a single day. 
So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. 
"Are there any witnesses?" 
We are in a position of danger. 
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan. 
But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open, and the walls are coming down. 
So the wires were uninsulated. 
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting. 
And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. 
But we realized that seeds -- there's been this very serious project happening -- but that seeds -- at these major botanical gardens, seeds aren't on show. 
But there are about a million of them. 
(Laughter) Now this is probably a good thing, right? 
Would look at it. 
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person, undiminished through time, so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. 
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab, and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk. 
What might that world look like? 
No one's responding to each other. 
And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79, which is just below average. 
Would they really have different laws? 
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. 
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X." 
You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child, is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. 
Less meat, less junk, more plants. 
He was getting started early. Those were his hands. 
But I think that there really is something coming along after us. 
And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning. 
So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. 
That process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual. 
Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems. 
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. 
Now this is people science. 
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage, along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings. 
If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink. 
It doesn't radiate. 
And then when we zoomed into this, it's like a veritable universe. 
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface. 
So that's DNA origami. That's one way. There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA. 
Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house. 
I realized society didn't value my passion. 
Personally, I think it's something sexy. 
They were not allowed diplomats. 
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling, and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic, in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza. 
"Know thyself." 
In another part of the same story, all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark, so birds, livestock and wild animals. 
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge. 
Now take it to the last step. 
What would I love? 
Salman was the consummate perfectionist, and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture. 
We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. 
And when things work well, then the nervous system works well, and everything functions. 
What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. 
So what happens? 
And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. 
Now, remember the picture, how much she looked like her grandmother, at the beginning? 
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. 
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences. 
It's otherworldly, beautiful. 
And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze on a thing they call a thali. 
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now, and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things, like when you take off from LAX, you're really not thinking you're using the Internet. 
Unfortunately, these good laws of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation, laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. 
"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant." 
But still, here in the year 2011, there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan, which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals. 
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure, smoking is just the opposite. 
Now, contrary to what many people believe, terrorism is actually a very expensive business. 
And sometimes by doing this kind of research, you encounter such beautiful ideas of design. 
And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent. 
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out? 
And for a while that was looking really good. 
This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. 
But if you look, even today there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths in India alone. 
And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact. 
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. 
Anyway, the question I think people should talk about -- and it's absolutely taboo -- is, how many people should there be? 
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences, either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods, and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives. 
So this is not using any suction, any glue, and it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot -- it's as biologically inspired as the animal -- hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface. 
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities, we need to think a little differently. 
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust. 
(Laughter) We squashed it, we rethought it, but mainly we renamed it "the heart of school," and that changed everything forever. 
And to me, that's the most important thing because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love. 
So Netra and I really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy, and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. 
First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. 
These are just remarkable, remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. 
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side, but we actually had this real wow side.

They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And each time I get done with ♪ Ooh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one ♪ 222. 
But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude. 
Your body doesn't like the saltwater. 
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. 
Pollution, global warming, these things -- the consequences are distant in time and space. 
It was so simple, in fact, that I suspect a really smart high school student, who didn't even have calculus, could understand what he wrote down. 
First, though, I should probably explain why, and how, I got to this place. 
One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes -- when the car crashes, the front hits into something -- indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. 
We've heard a lot about that. 
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there. 
And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that, you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health. 
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes. 
And the base of the building is again about public space. 
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. 
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world? 
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. 
That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years, that's mankind moving forward. 
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. 
They're still very useful. 
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us. 
To be is to do. 
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist, so in my day job, I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions, how the brain makes decisions, how the brain learns and so on. 
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda. 
How do we get it to Mars? 
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that. 
Well, this one female came up to him.

There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there. 
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. 
In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table. 
Most people fled abroad.

If you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement." 
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?" 
I think what we have is a pickle problem. 
(Applause) CA: So, I want to ask you a couple other questions, and if any of these feel inappropriate, it's okay just to say, "Next question."

I've been sending out valentines These are my valentines from 2005 and 2006. 
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl. 
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves. 
We like to make things. It's fun to make things. 
And we have to resist to the changes. 
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters, but also comes in other forms. 
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity. 
CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED. 
I got lucky. 
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage. 
They're going to be tapping into carbon credits. 
I actually realized once in Kosovo, when I watched a man break down, that bullets are actually hardened tears, that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion, and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful and violent. 
It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives. 
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things, you know, and the serious things that we try to do. 
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. 
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. 
And thirdly, public demand. 
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.

Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it. 
Okay, we'll do something with it. 
And here's his second bit of advice. 
And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. 
We stole the idea from bicycle seats, and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots. 
And some of equipment went with them, on the top of the canopy, to save it.

My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big. 
Tasty! 
We don't need to go to space to answer that question. 
So making a living is not that easy for young people. 
So this is the first man that we tried it on. 
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. 
Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. 
Couldn't find it. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, can we see that? 
My sister and I started this project in 2005 because in that year, at least in the science press, there was a lot of talk about global warming, and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs. 
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table? 
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED. 
And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. 
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. 
So, there must be underwater hot springs. 
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything, apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet. 
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound. 
It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. 
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets. 
And any plastic can be any color, as you probably well know. 
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. 
And so what is symmetry? 
And that's a big problem, and we'll return to it in just a second. 
I travel all over the world taking pictures -- some of them good, most of them not. 
If you look at the air pollution health effects, this is the number of deaths per year in 2020 just from vehicle exhaust. 
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. 
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED. 
We're so proud to live here in California. 
So it spawns itself.

So sustainability, which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. 
We had a car that came by, same identical car as described by the teenagers, right? 
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also. 
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically, the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. 
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it. 
Wouldn't that be handy? 
And for him, it's only his second. 
This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. 
And this piece here is -- I don't know what it is. 
I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair, wrapped in a plaster body cast, and feeling the sun on my face for the first time. 
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system.

We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins. 
It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age. 
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level; they had no need to touch her breasts. 
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets, or if they were, there ought to be a law to allow the children access. 
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much. 
And not just us. It's also kids. 
And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? 
LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics. 
When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level, we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. 
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes. 
It was about 1960.

Disability is an equal-opportunity provider. 
Again, all of this is done in the way us humans do things, and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. 
And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view. 
The bottom line is, we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together.

In fact, every region of the country could do this. 
What's the point of all this? 
But it was something he later turned to his advantage. 
This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself. 
The first half of the 20th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs, a cataclysm. 
Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it? 
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them.

We all love chocolate. 
The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point, but we must be good custodians. 
So here, diamonds, hearts -- no, diamonds. Good, good. 
(Applause). 
(Laughter) I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. 
So for women, housework prevents breast cancer, but for men, shopping could make you impotent. 
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing software to do that. 
It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you, it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class. 
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education -- everyone -- and we said the public, institutions, religious institutions, schools -- everyone was involved. 
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world? 
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding, new opportunities for action begin to emerge. 
And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. 
Now, this is big. 
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam. 
Now if your perception is much worse than your reality, what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality? 
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus. 
So there were a lot of teachers who were like, "She's never going to make it. 
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it. 
I know there's going to be disbelief. 
15 seconds studio. 
Not that robots aren't useful and people can build robots. 
It's like the parts list of your body. 
They had to worry about being bombed. 
Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision, and it's very important to try to reduce this. 
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see: do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more? 
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. 
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?" 
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician?" (Laughter) Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you, or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world, when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession, they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake, a monkey and an iguana, and through all of this, I feel, strongly, that something is going wrong. 
It's around 2,000, and it's called the Sagole Baobab. 
So how do we solve? 
And the answer was, "God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore." 
It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them. 
(Laughter) And this is what happens. 
Well I'm afraid not. 
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 
That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say (Applause) that he supports -- (Applause) that he supports marriage equality. 
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature. 
(Laughter) "Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you." 
Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed. 
So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system, just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence, chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. 
You see India, you see Brazil. 
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. 
Good morning everybody. 
Later he renamed it the stethoscope. 
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in, turn on, drop out thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories. 
And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can't even obtain a meal. 
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead. 
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate. 
Again, a daunting task. 
Porous, nonporous. 
This is part of DEPTHX's mission. 
We might end up with something like this, which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that. 
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. 
And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago. 
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire. 
I had been growing all my own food. 
(Music) (Laughter) (Applause) Pretty cool, huh? We think so. 
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits, unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts. 
And maybe they're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know. 
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter, day and night, on a bench in the 103rd Street subway station, until finally one day she vanished. 
If you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person. 
Cost-benefit analysis. 
And you can see, off a tiny film, incredible clarity. 
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky. 
Thank you. 
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. 
(Audio) ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫ ♫ And things that looked so good yesterday ♫ ♫ are now shades of gray ♫ ♫ And it seems like the world is spinning ♫ ♫ while I'm standing still ♫ ♫ Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell ♫ ♫ And then you say ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ And now the words sing ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ 
And then performing arts high school. 
Greater subjective well-being. 
So where are the Phoenix Islands? 
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist, that you are an anthropologist photographer, that you are an activist photographer. 
Why? 
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. 
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. 
But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. 
They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos. 
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it. 
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. 
I'm colorblind. 
You can play with a different type. 
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure," which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. 
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. 
This is all true. 
Did the camera got it? 
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world to a "some rights reserved" world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content, building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work. 
So sometimes I view from the inside, like EgoCentriCity and the inner circles. 
Do you want extinct species back? 
But what will come in the future? 
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin. 
The second time, it's engineering. 
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed: this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol, or keeping tabs, if you will. 
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do. 
So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO, and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom. 
Students may display captions in their native language. 
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. 
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally. 
DH: It was TED. 
And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
That's something we can learn from. 
The real patient often wonders, where is everyone? 
And aside from coral, the answer is no. 
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way. 
But we've still got problems. 
The only question is, how short can you get? 
Watch it very closely, and you'll see why my six-year-old son now wants to be a neuroscientist. 
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States. 
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good. 
Ideology, zealotry, unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do. 
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. 
And you can see, they all follow the same line. 
These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. 
When's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend? 
You can't type very much on this. 
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively. 
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town. 
("That's wrong") (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) It's what you dream about. 
And then I thought, myself, how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology? 
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued and you're not having any fun. 
And so students like myself with nothing to do, we would learn how to program it. 
And his father said, "I sure do. 
My brain started thinking. 
You saw during that video all those flags. 
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. 
Obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward, and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest. 
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged. 
So let's turn that off. We're indoors. 
Another thing that has to be true about this pack: this pack cannot be really materialistic. 
And what a wonderful thing it is. 
The court system wasn't functioning properly. 
He's the random state of nature we emerged from. 
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. 
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on? 
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. 
Last lesson, from a Latin American: This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. 
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic. 
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper? 
When I was 16 in San Francisco, I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. 
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 
There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. 
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing, but what happens is women, they come together -- under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers -- they come together, and they share their personal experiences. 
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech, they were designed for speech. 
Essentially it's propaganda. 
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. 
(Applause) This song is called "Farther than the Sun." 
And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. 
But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet. 
But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel. 
The Earth is neither flat nor round. 
The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. 
But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals -- the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. 
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. 
And his answer was yes. 
But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated. 
So let's get started now. 
(Laughter) But by the time you get to block nine, you see that respiratory syncytial virus. 
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership, is trying to do. 
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah." 
The second reason we really liked MRI is that there's no radiation. 
So they are able to do it in that sense. 
Thank you very much. Thanks. 
That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. 
Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order, and I've already hinted that the answer is no. 
But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you? 
Just being able to visit places in different times, you can explore this for hours, literally hours on end, but I want to show you one thing in particular, so I'm going to open up the destination tab, spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1, and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby. 
And by the time a diagnosis was made, she was in a deep spiral. 
He knows one world, and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world, both of which he has deep connections to. 
There is nothing here that we don't know. 
They're driven by this duty and this obligation. 
Yes, put that aside. 
But actually if you look at melody, what you find is that there's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls. 
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively. 
And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens, asking, "What is the vision of the good life that our products, our design, present to us?", then you often get the shivers, because of how little we expect of each other, of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like. 
I mean, these things sound trite, but they are deep evolutionary truths. 
But like the Maginot Line, the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge, because not one of those four things was true in this environment. 
And so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities. 
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. 
Was I who I had been before the crash, before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book? 
In fact, the first person I interviewed was George Abbott, who was 97, and Abbott was filled with the life force -- I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it. 
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the history of music and television on the Internet in three minutes. 
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. 
And not from the power of an edict down. 
And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle, we know all about that." 
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general? 
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over. 
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now. 
Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans. 
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs, never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with. 
It's about the size of Lake Ontario. 
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers, and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. 
The texture changed in the drums this time. 
And if you go to 1989 -- something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize -- but many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe." 
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride, which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. 
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin. 
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. 
And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue. 
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm. 
This morning, some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition. 
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language. 
Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears. 
I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. 
And two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour, which are against poisonous and rotten material. 
I didn't get that sighted. 
It is insane what dance is right now. 
And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts. 
So when I get sad about sanitation, I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks, and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos, washlet toilets. 
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything, even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant. 
So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together. 
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way, or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space. 
Something else is going on. 
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies. 
But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world. 
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that. 
We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it. 
For us now at Movember, we really focus on three program areas, and having a true impact: awareness and education, survivor support programs, and research. 
It was absolutely incredible. 
They've never found a society that did not have it. 
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling. 
And that was true until I got to college. 
I was born in 1976. 
Except, I even started painting dancers. 
And I'll be honest, all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me. 
And it isn't only depression in which these sex differences occur, but they occur across so many diseases. 
Instead, she felt more free, more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya. 
I remember so many patients, their names still vivid on my tongue, their faces still so clear. 
There are some mapping people who do use their names. 
And we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing, by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band. 
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II. 
They handcuffed him to a chair, and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail, then left him there to bleed to death. 
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. 
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays. 
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue. 
However, if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan, and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today, you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. 
And so the suggestion is, well hey, if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this, maybe it would be a good idea, again, with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person, again, they haven't actually killed them. 
We think they're all separate devices, but in fact, every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. 
"There's Moscow, Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto!" 
Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further, because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped. 
Every technology is transformed and moved by others. 
Translucence is glamorous -- that's why all these people wear pearls. 
I think it's important. 
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California, which is a particle accelerator. 
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world. 
(Applause) CA: So, I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor. 
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. 
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? 
He was infected with HIV. 
Jonas Salk has a great quote. 
And why not take control of it ourselves? 
Now, how many things are these? 
So that is an example, both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better. 
We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI, the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. 
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. 
And there's several ways of doing this. 
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people. 
"That's success," he said. 
It can be sexual intimacy – I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. 
(Applause) These are grim economic times, fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed. 
So that's what we are planning to do. 
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism. 
However, consumers have moved. 
The old shyness was a fear of rejection. 
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. 
This young woman wished for other things to happen, it happened for her. 
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. 
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location. 
It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. 
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then? 
You see here a little video. 
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. 
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place. 
We go into the Cold War, and we continue to try and build walls. 
The third thing is our higher education. 
And they've captured the process through familiar ways, through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices, because that small group of people, the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions, they might be small but every one of them has a blog, every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week. 
The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you -- and he says, "Bite 'em. 
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. 
They have often been rejected by their families, have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them. 
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED. 
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians. 
She imagined her father killing her on one hand, and Mama Agnes greeting her, with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. 
But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today. 
So, if we have a population of a thousand people, and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen, we don't have to immunize every single person. 
And, in fact, we've done this. 
So bear with me as I take you through this journey. 
I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant or that it's bad for polar bears or forests, though it certainly is. 
These are just a few examples. 
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. 
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. 
And serious competition from Europe, from Korea, and next is China, which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. 
And imagine what might happen, because every region has something to offer. 
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other, they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten. 
So, this is an astounding table. 
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer, and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. 
So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. 
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content, and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge. 
And basically, he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye, so when you're in space, you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you. 
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering, and American drops into eighth. 
And that third idea, that we will never have to be alone, is central to changing our psyches. 
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea, which was, well I'm still not heating the metal now, with this kind of engine, but I'm still reheating all the air. 
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper. 
This is a true story, my personal story. 
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still. 
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. 
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s. 
Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining -- a silver lining, here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not? 
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes, getting better and better stuff in them. 
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today. 
That is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince -- 500 times the power, yet only under a thousand casualties. 
So, these are the greenhouse tents. 
What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. 
In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals. 
On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network, which is very important; people really love social networking. 
She ate too much. She got unlucky. 
These mechanisms, these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo, they're controlled by the state. 
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. 
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants. 
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. 
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." 
Over 100,000 children learn science this way. 
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks. 
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults, and we also have a control condition where there's no director and instead we give people a rule. 
In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning and the surface of the Earth is going like a thousand miles an hour, and the Earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour. 
You have a unique smell, a unique vibration. 
So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were. 
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter) Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale. 
But what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements. 
It had to do with golf. 
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest. 
And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know. 
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) Basking sharks are awesome creatures. They are just magnificent. 
Thank you very much. 
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation? 
(Laughter) KS: No, not yet. 
And before you say it's a Norman Foster design, we designed this in '83. 
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this. 
It was he who penned the well-known words, "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of." 
(Laughter) (Applause) PM: Yes, you are. 
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation. 
This does not have to happen. 
So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers, in Israel and abroad, really give nature a chance. 
Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. 
Now not being a drug company, we could do certain things, we had certain flexibilities, that I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have. 
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau. 
But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality. 
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. 
So, it's a fake real. 
A third is that I wanted hot water for tea -- that's an intentional argument. 
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do, politicians, religious leaders, and us, it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" -- that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. 
(Applause) As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design? 
This is live transmission. 
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. 
Each one thought that the other was a fool. 
Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont. 
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) -- because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that. 
And here's what he wrote: "I looked at her face, and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. 
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. 
This is really unpleasant stuff, and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever. 
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. 
Maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
In order to survive, he needed to be working. He asked the man to write "dyer." 
I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. 
(Laughter) And I say, "Yes, they're all for you." 
And similar ideas can be used, for instance, to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. 
Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. 
It's called "Among the School Children." 
For example, when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada, the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. 
Okay. There's 15 feet. 
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes, rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized. 
Meanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s, the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely. 
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface, spreads out over the surface of the planet. 
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines. 
And by this, I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate, the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. 
Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. 
We need to put ourselves into boy culture. 
During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America, which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War. 
These people who had life-long fears of snakes were saying things like, "Look how beautiful that snake is." 
So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back. 
It's either E natural, and 659 vibrations per second, or E flat, at 622. 
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. 
So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. 
I worked after for an investment bank. 
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. 
(Laughter) We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. 
And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc, and 30 vintages of Yquem. 
The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women? 
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book. 
But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran. 
They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing. 
It was more atonal and twelve-tone. 
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience. 
They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. 
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes, and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face: the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries, the gradual changes in our climate. 
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y. 
And that was a Humboldt squid, a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long. 
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. 
Journalism was an answer to an even more important question, which is, how will society be informed? 
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well. 
Does anybody know what he was looking for? 
Why? Because potholes have to get filled, because the trains have to run, because kids have to be able to get to school. 
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need. 
And of course, these tailings ponds -- well, you can't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these, so maybe we should stop calling them ponds -- these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River. 
And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course. 
And the starting point is the -- for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. 
It's a horrible term of trade. 
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. 
Step out of the moral matrix, just try to see it as a struggle playing out, in which everybody does think they're right, and everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them -- everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. 
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle, or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish. 
Is matter evolvable? 
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases. 
Okay, for a second example, think about this cultural hero, icon on the Left, creator of this character. 
And all the tiles match up again. 
So some things that are missing is, for example, if you had a flow of energy through a system, what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself, much like living systems do. 
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. 
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being. 
And I've fallen in love with him, as I have with Herbie and with his music. 
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. 
But you can see the voids, you can see the complicated structure, and you say, well, how did this happen? 
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity. 
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. 
No, it's worse than that. 
And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent, which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states. 
Who says it's too expensive? 
You no longer have the queen's protection. 
One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. 
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums. 
So they have no incentive to conserve. 
Well, we have an idea. 
Most firemen in this country do it for free. 
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. 
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance. 
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children. 
And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse." 
That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to. 
These are cholera beds in Haiti. 
Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking -- nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. 
And they do it with their tail. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them. 
They were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. 
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. 
So, here I was again with a small team, in uncharted territory, doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. 
1.6 million deaths worldwide. 
(Applause) To understand the world that live in, we tell stories. 
Would they delight us? 
You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" out in the majesty of the ocean, not songs about heroin addiction in New York City. 
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. 
I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. 
So, here's the cause. 
He did it because he couldn't afford a car, but also because he knew how to build one. 
Now it's: I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. 
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better. 
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man. 
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories. 
Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm, a feathered tempest. 
And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. 
These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound, from the mundane to the humorous. 
So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you to come down and take a closer look. 
To sell his idea, he became a showman. 
I can remember someone saying this to me, with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God. 
No Labels and Common Cause, I think, have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective. 
And it is under seven feet tall, so it will fit in a standard construction garage. 
And maybe something else. 
The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates, that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. 
Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating. 
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force. 
What that was was a bird feeder. 
But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions, I found there was a kind of a missing component, for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries. 
When I go out to direct a film, every day we prepare too much, we think too much. 
But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode, which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy. 
And finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. 
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg. 
But the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light, recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. 
(Applause) In Oxford in the 1950s, there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual, named Alice Stewart. 
So, for example, full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system, the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses, replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment, and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment. 
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards; you cannot stay where you are. 
He knew all about that kind of science. 
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. 
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month. 
This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it, moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. 
From the moment that our ancestors, perhaps two and a half million years ago or so, began imitating, there was a new copying process. 
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong? 
There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: that of personal storage. 
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time. 
You'll know, because your car will know, because that other car will have whispered something in his ear, like, "By the way, five minutes, motorcyclist, watch out." 
This is deeply democratizing. 
It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. 
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. 
But even today, that memory is still in people's minds. 
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. 
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence. 
So I'll give you four. 
Or you look at Johnson &amp; Johnson's Momversations. 
And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. 
And all the main religions have similar teachings. 
All right? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates, including chimps and bonobos, because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. 
I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine, for four dollars each. 
And while there's no substitute for speed, maneuverability is a very close second. 
And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again. 
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand. 
Without actually having to query them at all, we can get this kind of a structural insight. 
I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil. 
And design is responsible for this experience. 
So, water is a very important aspect. 
(Applause) I'm a savant, or more precisely, a high-functioning autistic savant. 
And all these devices will be portals into that. 
What about the probability of being caught? 
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. 
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose. 
In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand, and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph; we now call it an Eulerian path -- you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice. 
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. 
And what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. 
So that was nice. 
And so, when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event, it leaves this indelible record. 
"But why?" I asked him. 
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel. 
This is a work by Jackson Pollock. 
Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. 
The gray dots have grown exponentially. 
We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are, but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc. 
We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores, and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work, we even applied for food stamps. 
It's such a great way to -- I mean, they should make Java books like this, and we've have no problem learning a program. 
Have you been watching the commercials? 
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea, in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. 
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures, a green one and a red one, then one has to be better than the other. 
It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. 
Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD of Chinese language, you can't understand them. 
Thank you very much. 
What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought, which is, "I reckon I can heist these." 
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. 
It's not being imposed by fiat from above. 
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes to start in an hour's time, you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works. 
We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain. 
(Applause) Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist, and we both study complex networks. 
(Laughter) "We're going to make sure you don't do it again." 
And I look at this thing, and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller, networked, open world that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited. 
And in humans, we call it the "body clock." 
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can, they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk, or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales. 
That's 15 years of progress. 
E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public, she loves to take in the arts. 
So just to finalize, we're all individual. 
One is called the general election. 
And when you start looking at that, and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai, it's literally a forest of skyscrapers. 
Alzheimer's disease: there's five million people affected, and you can check vital signs, activity, balance. 
Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.) (Applause) Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled, because, you see, my father's name was Ted, and much of my life, especially my musical life, is really a talk that I'm still having with him, or the part of me that he continues to be. 
The gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends. 
Giraffes are this desire in the dark." 
This was a small model. 
They go around looking for what it is. 
I'm going to move to some pictures of China. 
So immediately, we're rejecting them. 
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35, and comes out of this perfectly fine. 
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm, we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. 
Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme, outside of specifically religious ones, is the one about the phoenix, the ancient story of the phoenix, who, every 500 years, resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life that is even more beautiful than it was before. Richard, thanks very much. 
So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. 
But contained inside those documents was a new language, a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -- namely symmetry. 
But, this is really just the tip of the iceberg. 
He read my mind, and he said, "I ask for a job." 
It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it. 
So I called the Humane Society and I say, "Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs, Can you tell me the deal?" 
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people. 
And I will share one of the rituals with you. 
It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices. 
I don't think so. 
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. 
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings, different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings. 
And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they're so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold. 
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM, can you guys tell us whether this works or not?" 
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school. 
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then. 
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had, and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. 
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement, where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about, "Ain't I a woman?" 
I found myself in Argentina in 2005, decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating. 
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation. 
Then, this is a look at the inside. 
So this scenario makes predictions. 
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. 
Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks. 
"Would you like some help?" 
The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate. 
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images, and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh. 
So where are we headed from here? 
And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records, she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years. 
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments -- but it is very necessary. 
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls, why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?" 
So, let me finish by saying that we've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem. 
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations. 
So we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on in school, and kids weren't going to school. 
The verb is the chassis of the sentence. 
Thank you. 
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet. 
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm. 
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram. 
Let's see how they can do it. 
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed. 
And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. 
Last year on climate, for example, we had the highest global emissions ever. 
So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing? 
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right. 
What we do is have the patient go all the way open and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?" 
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people. 
We must course-correct. 
How do we help people like that? 
High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money. 
Do you know where your grandparents were born? 
You won't be familiar with it. 
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well. 
You have to keep their attention. 
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda. 
So a rational choice economist would say, well, you should take all non-zero offers. 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer, and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed "between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves." 
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this. 
I'm calling my initiative, "Take the Other to Lunch." 
So just as we manage national parks, where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors. 
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler. 
I thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing." 
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas. 
Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years. 
Forty-eight governors competed, convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum. 
And if I want to go in to book a flight, I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline, and I'm linking to that page. 
Feeling and model in our head, reality is the outside world. 
Similarly, if we'd had this talk 30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons, and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply, prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers. 
The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is -- here's a simple analogy: Ferraris are cars that have engines. 
So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how. 
Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally. 
So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase, they would smell like wintergreen. 
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?" 
So, one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying, which is really what it is, is the establishment of trends. 
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s. 
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots. 
In our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply, because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen. 
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. 
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex. 
How much depends on how lucky you are. 
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act. 
In fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire. 
Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma. 
So here's just the standard area map of the world. 
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly. 
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it. 
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys. 
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships. 
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. 
He burned all his poetry at the age of 24 and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest. 
Now, he's selling them to Walmart. 
And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years called Bayesian decision theory. 
They're delicious. 
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically. 
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood? 
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade, and he went in under my elbow, and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. 
And then the other areas become less and less positive. 
She kind of set us up. 
But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. 
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this. 
Unfortunately, that's all the good news because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times. 
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. 
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu. 
And I've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in Africa. 
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 
Oh, hey." 
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food. 
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. 
And as they pick that, these become bone, and then they pick another road and these become platelets, and these become macrophages, and these become T cells. 
She didn't care where. 
You know, hero -- people's hero -- bringing this important light. 
But fortunately, they never had to use it. 
And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen. 
Get out of it, get it out. 
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock? 
Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause) In striving for the heights of creative genius, we want to give thousands of people the motivation, the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa. 
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life. 
Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. 
And you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for. 
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States." 
So I am looking still for a Stephanie. 
Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing. 
How do the media talk about schools and teachers? 
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. 
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. 
It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. 
And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. 
I would encourage you to become a cyborg. 
(Laughter) That's reassuring. 
And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades, we've expanded the money supply, expanded credit and debt, so that people can keep buying stuff. 
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. 
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking, the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis. 
I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. 
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. 
In 1979, I witnessed my first military coup. 
Now most people would answer grilled, and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. 
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species. 
And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. 
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. 
We start with poverty. 
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. 
But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. 
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake. 
And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them? 
Thank you. 
It turned out that it wasn't, that it really is a system of motivation, a system of wanting. 
And when my mother was two years old, the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary. 
So what did we find after computing all this network control? 
This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite, or moved around like a kite. 
What does the system look like? 
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in 430 B.C. He put it nicely. 
Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum. 
And he's like, "Well, we don't need one." 
The most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers, and we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest in, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale. 
Emmanuel Jal: All right. 
(Applause) So in order to do that, I founded a charter called Gua Africa, where we put kids in school. 
They were never given a chance to learn how to react." 
In this case, the process is deterministic. 
These nano-bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications: cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. 
What you can see up here is a map of the world, and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite. 
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. 
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses, particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size, but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects. 
Can we run that, Andrew? 
Well if cancer can be caught early, enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out, excised with surgery, I don't care if it has this gene or that gene, or if it has this protein or that protein, it's in the jar. 
She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like, "Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist." 
Or I'll come to them and say, "Here's what I need done." 
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime. 
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies. 
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds: can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards? 
(Laughter) (Applause) I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard. 
(Laughter) So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing. 
Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. 
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date. 
And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. 
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. 
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here -- a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head? 
So when I get really depressed about all of this, I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution. 
And we just count on down to the bottom. 
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. 
"You mean God didn't want my bread?" 
The potential energy savings is very, very significant. 
Let patients help. 
But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds. 
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds. 
We can choose to take time back. 
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus, and you said worth a try, so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things? 
from somewhere in America. 
And that calculation isn't much in dispute. 
I had to learn the language. 
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back. 
And Mahmoud was coming every day. 
I'm joking, yeah? 
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America. 
What are you allowed to say or not say? 
Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders, when the insecurities might abate? 
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom, which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age, which was the X-ray machine. 
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. That, to them, means they can walk. 
He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, to drive him through the streets of Kabul. 
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well. 
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. 
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. 
But who's counting? 
Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is, for those who don't know. 
Every single year: fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers, fewer welders, fewer pipefitters, fewer steamfitters. 
But he did his best, and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine. 
I felt not quite ready for that job. 
Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game, walking all those holes. 
Owl, yeah. 
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. 
The post-colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating, and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment. 
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. 
FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. 
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it, so I'm not sure that you can. 
And what they found was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women. 
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. 
I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. 
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area. 
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient, that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes, so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. 
You can't hire everyone in a company, right? 
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. 
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India? 
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal, because it was against the order of nature. 
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all. 
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow. 
The first is that we need to simplify the message that we're using, stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself. 
And where do they come from? 
Well the act of drawing airplanes led me to, when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school, led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering. 
People were leaving to go back to the land. 
What does that focal length do? 
I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that. 
We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals. 
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt. 
CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed? 
I took pictures of everybody's hands, because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody, and asked everybody to make a funny face. 
And so the material can assume a lot of formats. 
Our dream is for our partners, our husbands, not to be given to us because of a horoscope, because they've been tested for HIV." 
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making. 
Let me show you how far you can do that. 
I had to hook it up to a computer, so I couldn't just train it anywhere. 
And there was some staff too. 
Like the occurrence of moire patterns. 
And then through a series of steps, he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open and they'd be looking in there. 
There was a burning question though that would not leave me. 
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach. 
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way, over and over again. 
So, you start with the darkest one. 
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. 
Give him some money." 
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes. 
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize. 
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. 
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime, he isn't speaking about corruption. 
Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about is care customization, because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking, those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system, but there's still too much guesswork. 
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 
Good evening everybody. 
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military. 
If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile, any carbon map of the U.S., it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S., hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs, dark, peaceful in the countryside. 
(Laughter) I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. 
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs. 
But even today, 50 years later, there's still so much more to learn. 
Part of the urgency comes from the fact that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. 
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... 
This boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six, and then he started twisting his body, first the right foot, then the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm, then the trunk, and then by the time he arrived, within the course of one or two years of the disease onset, he could no longer walk, he could no longer stand. 
My point is that this is not oil drilling. 
This is -- we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. 
It's got to reform economic policy. 
And most of the imagery is -- (Laughter) Claes', but those two little boys are my sons, and they were Claes' assistants in the play. 
So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking. 
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator, and you send it off to a mid-sized village in Africa, it will work great for a year or two years, and then something will go wrong and it will break, and it will remain broken forever, because you don't have a whole system of spare parts, and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment. 
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things, you know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning. 
(Applause) I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old. 
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different. 
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City." 
So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace. 
Or we push it down: they're more robust; there is less groups; but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. 
Thank you. 
Passion is the motto of all my actions. 
This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena. 
And in order to understand how serotonin works, it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. 
And this was very surprising to me, because I've gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments I decided not to do -- and I never got this guilt trip to this extent. 
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there. 
As part of selling, I was able to document the hard core evidence. 
Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior, and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me. 
Video: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies. 
Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living. 
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud. 
And this is the tropics. 
It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. 
My dad came out to see me graduate and, you know, I did the deal, and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... " You know what went on, he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. 
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. 
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work. 
And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story. 
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing. 
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. 
Now this is the way things are going to move, because China has a very specific problem, which is different from Europe and different from the United States: China has huge numbers of people and no space. 
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic. 
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking; I'm praying." 
They had modems. 
Crocodiles, of course, and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet. 
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel. 
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries. 
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize. 
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses. 
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK? 
And it's really simple, as you can see here. 
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. 
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted, and I replicated every last bone and put it in. 
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure, experimentally. 
It's amazing. 
(Laughter) Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible. 
Come to me and tell me what it is. 
Yet if you did, you would see something very, very similar to this. 
But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down, to condense them to their absolute essence, and from that essence create a new language, a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. 
Because, hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life. 
Now, instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones, Israel now had iron plows, and sickles, and hoes and military weapons. 
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this: "The foolish man built his house upon the sand / And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash." 
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs. 
We associate repetition with boredom. 
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President. 
And they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall. 
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity, this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring. 
Now we can chase them again. Go get them. 
This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology. 
At the same time, we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world. 
But that blackout risk disappears, and all of the other risks are best managed, with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect, but can stand alone at need. 
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary. 
I'm doing this as a demo, and it's more playful, but inevitably, all of this can be used. 
This is not an electron micrograph; this is just a regular photomicrograph. 
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology. 
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical. 
Because they were all about being free, the wind in your hair -- just to be free. 
That's what doing theoretical physics is like: there are a lot of wipeouts. 
We thought she was going to die. 
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox. 
You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this. 
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. 
JA: I'm not sure about the incident. 
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. 
The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited, in a way. 
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing. 
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. 
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games. 
They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again, and they ossify and calcify, and they become real. 
It's implanted with very conventional techniques. 
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog. 
And there's a lot of information. 
And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say. 
What does it look like? 
The warning signs are all there. 
Today, what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place; it's not. 
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease, where we're framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard, about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway, and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. 
It has lower taxes. 
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study, and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage, will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right? 
Here we are, like, crème de la crème, and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big. 
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term. 
There's about 10 million phage per job. 
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. 
We did not know about this life system. 
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage. 
It's incredible just how light this thing is. 
It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it. 
So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear. 
The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay? 
I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. 
And here was the introduction of this great British icon called "Elizabeth." 
I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being, its way of working, its way of feeling. 
It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work, and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface, and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very, kind of complex space. 
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through -- the dotted line, the temperatures. 
I remember what you said to me. 
BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. 
There's not enough room for the two of them. 
Or the interesting company SunRun. 
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before. 
But at the time, that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made. 
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks. 
It's, well, you can imagine. 
They pass information to each other. 
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived, but simply not implemented. 
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching. 
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device. 
And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world. 
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin. 
But we couldn't make sense of our images, until, six months after we got into orbit, an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan. 
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food. 
It took focus. It took dedication. 
What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. 
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. 
The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA. 
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be. 
They were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites. 
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. 
We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. 
So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. 
I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret. 
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. 
Around the world, people love. 
(Honk) (Applause) And when you get a very small one -- (Honk) This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. 
It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books, which was the inspiration for this particular idea. 
What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things. 
And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. 
So in yet another experiment, this one with students, we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior, including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one. 
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all, we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency, and they do very similar things with it. 
Everything is very efficient. 
Because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue, and "Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence?" 
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. 
So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction -- which is only based on your movement commands -- with the reality. 
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. 
This adds together four different waves. 
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. 
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. 
Anyways, I... where to start? 
Thomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric. 
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. 
And he said to me at the end of his year, "Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. 
Kano, Salaga -- they were all there. 
Here I got a prison assignment. 
Whatever." 
And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. 
(Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan. 
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right. 
You don't know how you do it. 
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. 
But maybe we should change the question. 
My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon. 
(Applause) I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon, which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. 
No, we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are. 
The first thing that anybody who knows science, and has been around science, is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. 
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search. 
But now that we're switching to merging medical data, making it available electronically, we can crowd source that information, and now as a physician, I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. 
If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. 
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. 
But now we have the answer to our question. 
Okay? Friends, family and financiers. 
He's coached five Olympians, and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he's coached. 
So what is this industrial Internet? 
As the frequencies increase, so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate. 
The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity. 
She simply said to him, "Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return." 
They're not going to be smart. 
Time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars. 
So I start the walk. Everything is fine. 
North Korea did that to some extent. 
(Laughter) JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. 
You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero. 
So water was something that scared me to begin with. 
That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity. 
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together. 
Help us tell the story. 
The last time I'd painted, I was 16 years old at summer camp, and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface, because that's not what this project was about for me. 
And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. 
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar." 
So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro -- the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. 
The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project, and the idea was very straightforward: we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. 
This is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic, all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate. 
The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn. 
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. 
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time, use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit. 
So I immediately decided, this is going to be the name of the game, or my new exclamation. 
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind. 
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch. 
And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized, but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way. 
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over, and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles, and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do, which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. 
We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent. 
So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other, and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer, which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid? 
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off. 
Thomas Edison had the same problem. 
And I thought about a solution to this problem. 
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard, even in inviting me, let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen, and I was somewhat resistant at times, and I was also very nervous throughout this week. 
Resolution is something that is far more limited. 
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here, and they will accumulate in the drunkest, stingiest people. 
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement. 
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere, it actually sounded pretty good. 
What did they spend it on? 
That's what I call positive African attitude. 
She did accept and then backed away. 
I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player, and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide. 
At this time, there were thousands of individuals, we think, that were infected with HIV. 
However, it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization. 
But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones, so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be. 
He's in his study, it's October of 1838, and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population. 
It's very easy to do. There's a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it. 
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait. 
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. 
(Laughter) More recently, finding ancient history. 
And over the course of 22 bombing missions, the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs on this 757 acre chemical plant, using the Norden bombsight. 
She said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone. 
It involves communicators to keep the funding high, to keep the visibility high, to tell the success stories. 
And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor, you have -- that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge, where you can find any solution of any problem. 
All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media, are proven wrong. 
(Audience Member: Creativity.) Creativity. 
An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time; we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair. 
But it wasn't easy. 
But in fact, what we've seen is none of those were true. 
Very simple. 
CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment. 
And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. 
And by 1980, the last train rode. 
After all, they decide, and they did. 
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. 
Or Ryan, who can't go to school, because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house, so he couldn't leave the house. 
I prayed for them, and things started to change. 
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death, you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays, flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before, were on the bottom of the ocean, alive, but now being thrown back as trash. 
You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings. 
No, I mean, I think -- CA: But is that your hair? 
MBI found 83 percent. 
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive. 
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts. 
So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. 
It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one. 
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility. 
So then it became quite easy. 
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night: We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. 
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. 
And you can also have active tails. 
You can create one out of Legos. 
It was a store called Draeger's. 
It was absolutely magical. 
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum. 
(Laughter) "Make this world a better place, if you can. 
One night, she had a dream. 
(Applause) June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures, they evoke so many different images. 
(Laughter) It works. 
But before I went out to photograph this component, I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. 
And then, you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral, in effect, we've shaved it. 
(Laughter) Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good. 
They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record, and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play, it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious. 
Thank you so much. 
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny, he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation. 
So he's going like this. 
You see a hand counting money just in front of me. 
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in. 
You feel kind of sorry for that thing, and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more. 
I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. 
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot. 
Yeah? OK. 
And some people get 100 percent discount, and some people get 20 percent discounts, and some people get 50 percent discount, etc. 
But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in, again, the world's worst places. 
I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead? 
So then here's the final ranking. 
on which we stand. 
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster. 
But media abundance never works that way. 
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here. 
In-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it." 
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. 
And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go. 
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great," this may seem a little incongruous. 
For most strains, you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. 
(Laughter) And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere, everywhere. 
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs. 
But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world, his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance. 
So encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right? 
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. 
This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. 
HM: To be frank, I just think this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way. 
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?" 
And this kind of a world, this vast flying beast you can ride around, shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. 
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them. 
That, I think, is movement. 
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners. 
That's the whole idea. 
The name means "edge of the desert." 
On May 11th last year, I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. 
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. 
There's no emotional reaction to his mother, because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut. 
Thanks. 
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. 
I don't want to depress you too much. 
But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area. 
And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue, and kind of punch it into the hard bone, into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out, each time, with a syringe. 
And we can predict these trends far into the future. 
And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. 
They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster, but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. 
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged. 
Then I used fibers out of my jumper, which I held and stretched. 
And they're scientific models? (Laughs) As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer, and this is a video of some of the beating heart that I've engineered in the lab. 
So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long. 
And suddenly, there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news, they say, "Okay, let's talk about this." 
And I know U.S.-China relations doesn't need another lawyer. 
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. 
So there are schools in slums like this. 
In fact, she need not have hurried. 
In science, we want to know what your reasons are for believing something. 
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system, deploy it all across the frozen north, and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place. 
But it was an exciting experience. 
Four across, four up and down -- it's 16. 
I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. 
And then her oldest brother stood up and said, "I too have something to tell you. 
And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived somewhere in his same town, and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat, when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering. 
So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies. 
They were saying, Make it stop now. 
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. 
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. 
They started dreaming about the decorations, invitations, the dresses they were going to wear, and what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter) It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes, but even if I could have slowed down those girls, I wouldn't have, because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need. 
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not others." 
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. 
Guess where that came from? Dragon. 
Interactivity was another thing. 
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations, each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share, creating a broader concept of the environment. 
And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing, certainly in the U.K., to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim. 
All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress. 
And ecologically, it was a disaster. 
She shows us, trains us how to do and how to be better [people] and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day, 10, 20 surgeries, and still you have to manage the camp -- that's how she trains us. 
Laugh though you will, all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did. 
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred. 
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it. 
These guys standing there, everybody in the photo, I feel this photo, man. 
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education, established by a man named Friedrich Froebel, who was a crystallographer in the 19th century. 
We learned these things from outsiders. 
There are no tethers. It looks around, searches for the ball, looks around, searches for the ball, and it tries to play a game of soccer, autonomously: artificial intelligence. 
Chanting: One united nation. 
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape. 
And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. 
Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it, you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. 
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together with the best lecturers in the world -- who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa -- and put them together and just let the sparks fly. 
And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required. 
But take a look at this. 
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools. 
The victim's brain releases oxytocin, and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money. 
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city, and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution, it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. 
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students. 
(Applause) And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers, especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors. 
And that happens in one individual. 
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice. 
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps, but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. 
Abed then told me why he'd suffered. 
What's life all about? Why am I here? 
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access, but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects, the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson, in preserving their topsoil. 
We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this, you know? 
There was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled, that an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. 
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal. 
Probably a form of synesthesia. 
(Laughter) And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them." 
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you. 
The short answer is: They return to the environment in one way or another, continuing the cycle of toxicity. 
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. 
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman. 
And that's just the way it is. You got that, son? 
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s, cultural and social revolution, which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose. 
And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about. 
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out. 
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work. 
It's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab. 
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity. 
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process. 
Here's the eye with the opaque lens, the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. 
Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries. 
Is it even possible? What kinds of controls should we do? 
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together and you've got something really powerful, but we need to put them together. 
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you, but they're now arrogant about their impartiality, and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes. 
That is my wish, my third wish. 
My language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side, whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth, and if this man was my father's brother, whether he was older than or younger than my father. 
And then when I took that moment to take a step back, magic. 
Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem. 
The world does not need any more pipelines to wed our addiction to fossil fuels. 
So we recruit some people for an experiment. 
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy -- namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality. 
This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures, but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. 
And me? 
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking. 
It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. 
Then art becomes useful. 
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago. 
I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?" 
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy, maybe a little more even, but this is also a largely solved problem. 
Why do this? 
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there, and I could never get rid of them after that. 
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center. 
But when we think about justice, Aristotle says, what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing. 
This is just European countries, but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia, always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree. 
So, now I want to move to sleep. 
And what he said was: treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels, because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment. 
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature. 
And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality, that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real, you transfer everything that you feel about it, this quality you have, and it's totally artificial. 
But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom. 
And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. 
One final story: this is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. 
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value, because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. 
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary, and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall, and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside, where they can't see and sense. 
It's not just about life, of course -- (Laughter) -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun. 
The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting. 
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team. 
As these two animals form a social bond, their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. 
In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people, 10 percent of the population, homeless. 
But it built a romance. 
So the question that motivates my research is the following: If you look at humanity's large-scale achievements, these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like for example, building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon -- there is a curious fact about them, and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people. 
We hold ourselves back. 
And in fact, what did happen to my brain? 
It was important not to look at those guns. 
This is from the Cape last year. 
I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged. 
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in. 
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. 
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser. 
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. 
Well, now, actually because of you, it is possible to change the physical world. 
And that's a lot of load. 
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals, who wouldn't be so concerned by law, and here you can see my mobile device. 
"Well, in order to reproduce." 
12 to 15 launches per year. 
My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells. 
And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. 
(Laughter). 
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail. 
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there. 
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India. 
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident. 
And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be, we would argue that they must be much lower. 
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves. 
Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth. 
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. 
If we manage to do that, forget the molecular detail. 
I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. 
And the outsider can never really reach the core. 
Okay, play in, how about A? 
And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama, which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis," — a charity I've worked with for years — "and you had a bucketful of lollipops. 
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored? 
Yes, some of these young people are connected to the Internet, but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little, is very small, because of many problems that we are suffering from. 
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago. 
They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller. 
And I realized that, in order to know where I was going, I had to know where I'd been. 
There's a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight. 
What's more likely, and we're seeing it today, is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center. 
Here, in front of this building, I'm sure. 
But this was a great, grand time of the computer, when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era. 
If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence. 
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. 
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. 
We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. 
And I think it's good moral exercise. 
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people -- and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions. 
(Laughter) but not to create the engineering colleges. 
From what I've seen this year, yes. 
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus. 
In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners. 
But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes. 
But they don't ever get used like that. 
You know, that's the strength of our argument, that we are doing something that's truly different. 
But the princess continued whistling. 
And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records, all the available records of these birds, put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. 
But much more importantly, the distribution is much wider. 
Of course, you're not actually working the whole time. 
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter) I think this was truly fantastic. 
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. The experiment is -- and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded, that you did it in a typical North American way, that is, you were raucous and incoherent. 
Every time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl. 
The door swings open, and the voice says, "Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's," -- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos." 
(Laughter) One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us. 
History tells us, they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. 
They flunk out of CalTech. 
And obviously, technology had existed before then, but we weren't aware of it, and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life. 
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note -- is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. 
A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming. 
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim: to bring governance to the global space. 
We filmed that process and aired a documentary. 
And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. 
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that, just like all politics, all jihad is local. 
Because we are all patients, we are all people. 
And what they found was something unexpected. 
This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered. 
And because the fetus is with her all the time, it hears her voice a lot. 
I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. 
But this was common. 
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this. 
(Music) These are all troubles outside of myself. 
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. 
But nevertheless, what the potential is -- and just keep looking there -- what the potential is, obviously, is to kind of move the border of who is the author, and who is the receiver. 
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. 
This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. 
And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this. 
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. 
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. 
I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates? 
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation, with vendors and suppliers. 
So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented. 
All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split. 
BMW is a pretty safe car. 
So my next film is called "Paani" which means water. 
What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment? 
I love when I'm in the laboratory, a new spider silk sequence comes in. 
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda, and the fact that it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention. 
But then authorities did something very smart. 
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes, or in terms of the data they present, but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing. 
We won the competition -- what was it, nine months ago? 
However, for these things to help us survive, it depends on them being carried. 
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action. 
Social: 45 years of what? 
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. 
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning. 
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time. 
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom; sometimes you don't. 
I never knew him in real life. 
Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs. 
But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. 
How can we do it? 
When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning. 
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous. 
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. 
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. 
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot. 
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again. 
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. 
Those things came along too recently. 
Or, as Nike's head of marketing says, "We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive. 
And then you need to add some more ports, and more. 
They were fantastic. 
And these were created without sketches, just freehand, by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it. 
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching. 
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. 
And for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then, unfortunately, the element kind of melted itself. 
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink. 
Then it's going to show inside. 
So, Einstein said that "For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope." 
It's really important to get those images and to show it. 
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. 
IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back. 
It was women's voice. Hear the guy -- yeah, more, more, more. 
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. 
The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. 
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful. 
We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body. 
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. 
(Applause) I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future. 
And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation. 
We think the world really looks like our buildings. 
It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes. 
With a giant battery, we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today. 
Thanks, little guy. 
So we're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective. 
Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that. 
We also found that the more people change, the better they got. 
I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie. 
Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005, but his memory lives on in my heart. 
And then there was another influence. 
So we had some good ideas: we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. 
And once you make these, you make a little house. 
What if -- (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! 
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses." 
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot. 
Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear]. 
So, this is the challenge for this bread. 
Very, very little. 
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence, back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on. 
They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can. 
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind. 
And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. 
We need to use less to make more. 
"Now I have to write what she tells me to write." 
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group, I have to figure out how to keep them quiet. 
So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation, but it's one of the tours. 
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet. 
When this result was first published, it was highly controversial. 
And all this at a time when the population has doubled. 
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. 
And if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug. 
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children, doing such a thing. 
What did Google come out with this year? 
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later, after the first video that I showed to you, is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. 
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. 
With a thousand Juliáns working together, Mexico would be a very different country. 
And having said to your dad, Nic, that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. 
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth, it's common goods. 
And they can handle water. 
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up? 
Even a shattered dream can do that for you. 
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize, if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel." 
We know that people will work from wherever they want, whenever they want, in whatever way they want. 
(Laughter) But not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies, it kills lots of mothers, and it's very expensive to produce. 
(Applause) I'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry. 
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles. 
He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees -- the largest refugee flow in history up to that point. 
He has been charged, about five days ago, with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50. 
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels, and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve. 
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen, so, it's quite prolific stuff. 
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. 
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming -- once I prime the brain to see it, it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it. 
They choose very carefully who they connect with. 
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females. 
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community. 
So, that's home really. 
You’re looking at the root of wheat, one of the world’s most important plants. 
It had been presumed before. 
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. 
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK? 
Before 1980, do you have any idea how many articles were in The New York Times on domestic violence? 
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked. 
I talked about the large, complicated robot. 
The second one is the privatization of terrorism. 
Thank you. 
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts. 
And, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with, without having to manipulate them so much -- which is basically what I do, I manipulate them. 
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. 
A, in fact, is more central, and this can be formalized mathematically. 
And if you move to the right you also get language, because that's abstracting even further from resemblance, but still maintaining meaning. 
Why? 
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. 
Thank you for reading. Goodbye." 
The world is mostly blue. 
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs. 
Okay? Ready? 
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? 
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture that saved 1968, which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in Paris, the height of the Vietnam War. 
Some of them are very easy. 
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money. 
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21. 
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger, the systems don't converge; they diverge more. 
At 74 years old, became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean. 
"I don't understand. Soybeans? 
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes. 
You are undisciplined." (Applause) And I repeat it for the continent. 
And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them. 
So, it actually works. 
But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. 
Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great. 
In detail, for instance, they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. 
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities. 
There must be a better way. 
And they share a lengthy land border. 
Normally when you improvise -- and I do it all the time around the world -- there's this initial period of horror, like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring, an awful pregnant silence. 
So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years. 
It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history. 
I think that actually this type of urban design, which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan. 
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI, to take a video, a movie, of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something. 
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate, that our triumphs are complete, that there are no mysteries in nature, and that there are no new worlds to conquer." 
I take you are preparing a major attack? 
A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83. 
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly. 
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities. 
I have to explain that to you. 
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo, whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. 
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking. 
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. 
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment? 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve, and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years. 
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. 
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants. 
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party with a group of good friends. 
This is the strange inversion. 
Every single surface of this restaurant is white. 
In fact, I've never found anybody that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly. 
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this. 
They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby. 
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that. 
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. 
Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town, getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist. 
All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long, slow climate change, and that really changed in 1980, in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio, where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks, which held creatures of the Cretaceous period, and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils. 
He put it on a personal basis. 
And second, they demoralize the activity itself. 
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome. 
They reversed the flow of water. 
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour. 
If you pick this person, the only friend they have to nominate is this person, who, by construction, must have at least two and typically more friends. 
(Applause) I think it's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives. 
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now. 
Thank you so much for sharing. 
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. 
Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections. 
(Laughter) I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. 
What you can see over here is Tamara, who is holding my phone that's now plugged in. 
That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect." 
And I think that my mathematics, surprisingly enough, has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses, all these branching systems, for which there was no geometry. 
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. 
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. 
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes. 
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. 
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject that I'm talking about. 
See, look, don't touch my designer jeans. 
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s -- that's what made us go back and work for them. 
But I also saw in my reflection that, had Abed not injured me, I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor and a husband and a father. 
And the reason is what happened in South Africa: Nelson Mandela. 
All right, let me then finish off with four general statements, an example and two aphorisms. 
Boy: What's making this light up. 
And I was actually a rocket scientist. 
I also found my wife online. 
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen. 
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area, where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold. 
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later. 
I think I have to say goodbye now. 
So I'm going to show you a demo of this. 
Move away from it and come back to it. 
But with the end of the Cold War came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace. 
Then I had to measure morality. 
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. 
I went to chef school in France. 
They grow 10 meters long. 
You could develop nausea, headache, your muscles could feel like they're contracting, and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking. 
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp. 
The background to one is the other. 
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen. 
There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. 
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. 
(Laughter) Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves, before others can laugh with us. 
He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis. 
And then the third key actor is the post-conflict government. 
So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs, because we can never know if we have those, but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization. 
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. 
So it's a little bit unexpected, but, in a way, it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents, which is in itself a form of honor. 
This is what it actually looks like. 
To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game, and then has to animate that particular sequence. 
We are the soil. 
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. 
In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. 
I went down to a depth of 880 feet and turned out the lights. 
And it happens in different realms. 
But I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted. 
SW: And a pig? 
Thank you. 
A fantastic project, the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent, from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east. 
When I was a child I knew nothing about this, of course. 
So finally, I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company, IBM. 
We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today. 
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food. 
And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And that is beautiful. Thank you. 
Now, there is a man on top of his job. 
It's four words; we call that a four-gram. 
And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb. 
So when he gives me his final paper, in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure, I say, "I don't know. 
My name is Henry Evans, and until August 29, 2002, I was living my version of the American dream. 
(Laughter) Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. 
When one morning, years after the crash, I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake, it was exhilarating, a gust of snow. 
She's not looking away from you exactly, but you have to mentally imagine her world. 
And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow. 
What's the secret to a happy family? Try. 
So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you, that means we did the right job. 
And on the flip side, we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies. 
We were growing plants like crazy. 
And when your parent is a drug addict, it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football, because as much as you want to love on that person, as much as you want to receive love from that person, every time you open your heart, you end up on your back. 
(Laughter) (Applause) "People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe, and no possible occupation except information gathering." 
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. 
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. 
Flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos, upload them, share them over the Web and so forth. 
Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. 
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there. 
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term, but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs, deprived early on, become more susceptible to disease. 
It's a new brain. You needed it. 
Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800, and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions, this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead. 
And if we are to move towards our collective bliss, it's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart. 
The next movement is called mobs. 
Again, like I said, my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell, and also making them for myself, obtaining them, appreciating them and diving into them. 
And for that I am very grateful. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. 
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind. 
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far. 
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. 
Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches. 
Now as you can imagine, this is not very popular with fourth-graders. 
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. 
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once -- to tell our story and have it heard. 
And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems. 
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. 
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity -- so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals. 
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish, the little animals floating in the water. 
It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. 
What we don't look for is value for many, while we are generating value for money. 
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. 
Most African stories these days, they talk about famine, HIV and AIDS, poverty or war. 
That's our two rules. 
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. 
(Applause) Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging? 
Africa is coming on line. 
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. 
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. 
How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? 
It’s not like you say, "Hey Joe, I’m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?" 
I feel ashamed. 
It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. 
This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro. 
And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor. 
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills. 
His name is Nyota. 
If we cut all the complexity away, we have the problem of scale. 
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities. 
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were, and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew. 
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo, because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. 
At that moment, we transcend space and time together. 
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi. 
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework, the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse, the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation, which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron. 
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right? 
I just took their pictures and pasted them. 
Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers, and people aren't even aware that they have changed, and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along. 
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California. 
We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams, and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam. 
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure. 
But there's an ecosystem here. 
By the early 90s, Congress passed the law that changed everything. 
So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. 
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals. 
Basically, what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient, and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh, how slippery they are, and we arrange them in an image. 
Raise your hands. Let me see. 
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids. 
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. 
Imagine that was Lake Superior. 
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out." 
These all happen to be on our computers, on computers across the world. 
So, where are they from? 
And so the idea is to represent each country on a map, but scale the area according to some quantity. 
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. 
But there are more important things that are already occurring: embryo screening. 
And a focus group cannot do it. 
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 
I became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks, and how they affect our lives. 
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?" 
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. 
What does that mean? 
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up. 
We can design better games. 
That's what I want this side to think about. 
But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. 
He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. 
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education. 
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue? 
We blast the air conditioning the entire way, and we never experience overheating. 
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina. 
They did have electricity, but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires, and could only power one feeble bulb. 
But I want to show you a different approach, and this is this robot over here, which has four legs. 
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. 
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. 
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. 
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars. 
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. 
So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement. 
Abuse could be affecting your daughter, your sister, your best friend right now. 
Then you can of course always go and see this guy. 
And from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult, painful period that we struggled through. 
He went around once, he went around twice, he went around thrice. 
So anybody who's here today with your significant other, just turn over to them and swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. 
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford. 
I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role, and something needed to be said. 
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself, even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. 
If innovation is less powerful, invents less great, wonderful things, then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. 
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell. 
You can still recognize them from their voice and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe," but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right? 
How are they organized? Are they isolated? 
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. 
This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China. 
This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum, from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. 
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole. 
He was a NASA space scientist. 
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana, and it involves beer. 
But it's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society, we had to go through two depressions, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Long Depression of the 1870s, two world wars, communist revolutions in Russia and in China, and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West. 
My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months -- seemingly unrelated, but as you will see, actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. 
And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right? 
The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. 
And sometimes things are okay. 
Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now. 
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. 
And watch again, right there -- successful. 
Thank God I announced the locations and everything. 
This is what bread has taught me in my journey. 
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand. 
So when I first set out to work on task allocation, my first question was, "What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks? 
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name, especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. 
This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate. 
Now what if you put together women and humor? 
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster. 
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK? 
And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation. 
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature, and puts it all together in things that are -- that make this conference, I think, more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. 
But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. 
I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West -- no, not the soft option that we have discussed before, but rather the soft power that Joseph Nye has spoken about before. 
And he said, "Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. 
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project, and Ben became an instant media celebrity. 
All of that is necessary, but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. 
And they’d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions -- and actually, quite valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on. 
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. 
T.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose." 
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music. 
And so I went to this, and of course I was gratified that it picked up the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did, but then it wants more information. 
My ability and my potential. 
So then, what do we do about that? 
Some people can hang on to five. 
(Applause) Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call, "Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?" 
(Applause) Let's just get started here. 
And this is very important light to capture, because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. 
I think there are various reasons. 
(Music) This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. 
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop. 
if you're the first site there, everybody links to you. 
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? 
They are the poorest of the poor. 
So that Roman society was very top/bottom, as ours is to some degree. 
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust. 
Before cancer, the world was something other. 
So, the technology is there. 
And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. 
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers. 
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. 
(Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies -- last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. 
That funds everything in the U.K. 
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed, the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground. 
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him, is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said, "Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not?" 
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. 
At Mach 20, we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds. 
But online, everybody speaks at the same speed. 
They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they're also looking at Africa. 
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. 
(Laughter) I said, "English, mum." 
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways. 
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine. 
They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment; they distribute it themselves. 
(Applause) I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa. 
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation. 
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. 
She said to me, "It is not about the burka." 
So let's first talk about biology. 
You know, it seems at this stage in your life, you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. 
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar," which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG, and the main characters would all be in CG, and the world would be in CG. 
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being. 
Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. 
So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it. 
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made, farting around in the dark using these platforms, and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles. 
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species. 
During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15. 
The answer is it matters quite a lot. 
(Laughter) (Applause) My last days in prison, the last 18 months, my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months -- my cellmate was 14 years old. 
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it's going to end. 
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide, by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont, who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet. 
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon, then on a railroad, then an airplane. 
When you exhale your breath, it goes in the exhale counterlung: when you inhale a breath, it comes from the inhale counterlung. 
That's what the show looks like. 
Textbooks and the library were not my playground. 
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music) MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience. 
(Laughter) ("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel. 
Currently, what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats, and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt. 
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart, because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed. 
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine. 
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy. 
Their brains and bodies will be stunted. 
This is an example that you might care about someday, and I hope you never do, because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer. 
It's also a radio, and it's also a torch, and more than anything else, it has really superb battery life. 
They're probably less cell dense. 
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts; it's called the Peace Building Commission. 
All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics. 
They said, "Go and do it, and we'll come and lecture." 
So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration. 
We understand that these will become much more virulent, that what we see today is this interweaving of societies, of systems, fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems. 
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce. 
We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane, and it's been a huge success. 
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old. 
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect," and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence, and I said, "What?" 
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent of the global Brazil-nut market. 
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones, for example, in a sweet pepper plot, they go to the flowers. 
If you're interested in more information, we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it. 
Find that which is not. 
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating. 
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. 
Nobody knows the chain of command. 
But I don't really care about that. Governments don't care about that. 
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter) There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff. 
It's already happening. It's not science fiction. 
Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project. 
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything, and just wait. 
At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. 
I'd prefer to quote someone else, who testified with me before Congress, and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless, like an electron, oddly enough. 
Really think outside the box. 
And the rest of both runs factories. 
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. 
(Laughter) I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -- but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. 
This insight that entropy increases, by the way, is what's behind what we call the arrow of time, the difference between the past and the future. 
They will tap your Internet connection. 
I know this because I read in the New York Times, the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad after September 11, in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran, the problem in this country, facing this country is the university professors and their spawn." 
I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. 
All the sculptures move by mechanical means. 
stemmed the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country. 
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average, and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine. 
So why should anyone care? 
You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets. 
That said, a lot of work goes into these. 
All my relations. Thank you. 
And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other. 
And somehow it will all make sense. 
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! -- doesn't know where it came from. 
We also see sharks, much more regularly than I would have expected to. 
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly, but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here -- instead of asking you for urine samples, I'll ask you for a mouse sample. 
That's 280 times around the globe. 
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example, how people are becoming passive. 
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year. 
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. 
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?" 
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. 
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy. 
Here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer. 
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be one of the smartest people I know, said he's going to do a study. 
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home. 
But the real big step was the neocortex. 
What does technology do to deception with those folks? 
Think of what that means. 
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle. 
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. 
But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast. 
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. 
And this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way? 
(Laughter) So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage. 
That's an appointment. 
Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. 
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba. 
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. 
And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy-makers. 
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary. 
That's how we use language most. 
You could still buy the music, but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. 
And you are noticing it more often. 
It was so exciting. 
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon, release the balloon, release the balloon. 
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S. 
But I rather play something completely unheard of, and even with flaws, than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. 
And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper, and as the hula hoop traveled around her body, she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there. 
Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. 
Fantastic! It's a beauty! 
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900. 
And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. 
And here's another paper. 
DNA analysis, one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started, was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. 
That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. 
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge. 
And so he was all very excited. 
What a place, what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two -- English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects. 
So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? 
So we are on the verge, 2015, of an amazing achievement, the schoolification of the world. 
They just give them a target window to not censor people. 
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. 
This is AirStrip Technologies. 
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least, of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them. 
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage. 
They gave them their name. 
Twenty years back, when there was a report on bank computerization, they didn't name the report as a report on computers, they call them as "ledger posting machines." 
And perhaps, the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, richer, stronger. 
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. 
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness -- again, it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed -- the only thing we do really, really well is sweat. 
Because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways. 
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers. 
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. 
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself, and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra." 
This is an incredibly rugged machine. 
Show everyone what you intend," is what he said. 
I started with a poem, I'll end with one. 
Let's first begin with a thought experiment. 
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number. 
So it was a series of five painful shocks. 
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. 
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here. 
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you, with the enormity of the situation, wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness. 
Why? Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising. What about our minds? 
One is a flash of white light. 
We are losing species from the Earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared, and leading that loss are amphibians. 
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar. 
It was the same art, physically, but the history had changed. 
And when I saw this man's work, I realized how bad I was at design, or whatever I called it back then, and I suddenly had a kind of career goal, kind of in hot pursuit. 
DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain." 
It's laying dead on its belly. 
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. 
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda, images, statements, but no real experience. 
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate. 
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced in Porto Alegre, Brazil. 
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut? 
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision. 
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR. 
So I found myself, in other words, constructing a geometry, a geometry of things which had no geometry. 
I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker, and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker. 
Together, for our future." 
(Applause) Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument. 
Just move to one side for us, if you would. 
And at first this didn't get a lot of support. 
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. 
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. 
But it begins with the gift of a good start. 
Thank you very much. 
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. 
And they say this with an amazing confidence. 
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?" 
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this. 
The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these. 
And he knew it was a hallucination. 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang -- you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle, and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off, fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December. 
People wrote in for reprints of that thing. 
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other. 
It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for, because I know this struggle isn't my own. 
There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate, in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies. 
But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy, if he was motivated by some random mental illness, he's in a completely different category. 
(Laughter) In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. 
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say? 
They may not be fast enough, but it has produced results. 
Penguins are real athletes: They can swim 173 kilometers in a day. 
We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. 
This is in Warsaw. 
We first approached the city about Pier 94. 
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice. 
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. 
I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. 
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. 
So, taxi journeys might be one example. 
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. 
Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost? 
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. 
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers. 
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., and then given primarily to people around Africa. 
2.9 seconds. 
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore." 
You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior. 
And I believe that we can do it together. 
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art. 
Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes. 
So, I came to give you a ride." 
And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input. 
When the Soviet Union was still there, the rich and the powerful, they needed the people, because they feared them. 
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field. 
But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story, because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity, he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. 
Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages, fishing, or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. 
These individuals are at specific risk, particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. 
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. 
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, India is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation." 
So I've seen life as one long learning process. 
And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. 
He's a very humble and wonderful human being. 
And so I did some experiments. 
Explains a lot, maybe. 
So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler, and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. 
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out. 
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially, some of the play principles and some of the design principles that, you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up, but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. 
And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to "unknown processes." 
And when the colonial period ended, what you had in place of that was, generally, secular dictators, which say they're a country, but did not bring democracy to the country, and established their own dictatorship. 
And this thing -- species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever. 
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems?" 
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have. 
But what you have here is actually four separate layers, and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and, particularly, how when they're compressed together and presented to the student all at once, how that creates this impatient problem solving. 
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that, along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be, exactly how long, etc. 
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. 
No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it." 
And we can then tubularize this scaffold. 
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop. 
And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin, the FACS shapes that we had. 
You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. 
We actually sit every few years, argue, disagree, fight, and actually come up with our very own 200-year plan. 
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency. 
I mean, what about their health? 
Google, of course, very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects. 
1917. This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate, or something like that. 
They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done. 
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there, it's always women, women, women, women. 
These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of. 
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. 
Well, lets go back to the 15th century. 
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair. 
It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. 
Now, it's not without its problems. 
Somebody get the front legs. 
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia, you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and if you just look at their face, you can see they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears. 
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company, decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D, what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs, just like Tom Friedman would predict. 
That's me on the left, my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond, and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project. 
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics. 
And while I was there, I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. 
Why don't they like my blog?" 
Those shapes are parabolas. 
Any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday? -- at the track, you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars. 
For example, we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000. 
And they're focusing on function. 
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want to categorize new things very, very quickly. 
and then hop across the pond to France. 
Thank you. 
You don't need something more in order to get something more. 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. 
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it. 
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. 
We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States, we are not prepared to cope with it. 
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt. 
We went to the doctors. We've just had a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden, and for some reason that I cannot comprehend, it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter) So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?" 
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing. 
(Music) Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation. 
Donate it, take it, and so on. 
And I ended up like going down the spices, and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper, thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. 
My sculptures are normally very simplified. 
Now, each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. 
Well, so I did tell the nurses. 
And I was required to answer: A. I have never had a genetic test, B. I've had one, here you go, and C. I've had one and I'm not telling. 
Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions. 
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this. 
And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me. 
I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card." 
And I'd like to start at the very beginning. 
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. 
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?

This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid. 
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.) When you look at the people you deal with .. 
There's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it, how we build it. 
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here. 
Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place. 
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. 
How do we really change children's relationship to food? 
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. 
So now I live in Los Angeles, because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there, and I always get asked by the media down there, because it's so celebrity-driven, "Who are your celebrity ambassadors?" 
And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow. 
I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like, to some extent, it is becoming self-evident. 
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S., or the leader of any other developed nation, woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create all the jobs I need in the current climate. 
If you strung all of them -- chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back. 
So, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light, and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists. 
It is the G8 Summit. 
Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term. 
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened. 
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques, shown here doing a lithotomy -- which is the removal of the bladder stone, one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time -- had to take less than two minutes. 
It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. 
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing. 
It's an open-source programming language, and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph, but a people graph, all of the interconnections among the people working on that project — and this doesn't look like an org chart. 
And what I mostly say is that, at that time, it was a pretty interesting idea to me. 
We found it was moving in really weird ways. 
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day. 
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus, but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species, the Neanderthals, lived in Eurasia. 
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems. 
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence. 
"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight, but she was really good at them." 
And I'm going to show you a small sample of this, but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion. 
Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity? 
Thank you. (Applause) Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life. 
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. 
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines. 
These are some pictures visitors sent to me. 
Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment, I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team. 
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they looked forward to him. And I was like, here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy. 
Let's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance. 
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. 
(Applause) Time flies. 
As you move side to side, it moves off. 
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. 
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. 
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise. 
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS -- it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said, "You tried your hardest and failed miserably. 
I know intimately that skin you are hitting. 
And then as they grow older, the horns grow forward. 
But those guns were really a message for me, and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me, my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis. 
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much. 
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. 
Everybody contributes a little bit. 
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible. 
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. 
So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter) We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds, and then the room exploded. 
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory. 
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. 
Thank you. 
And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures. 
That thinking has led to, I think, much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business, that I come to criticize in business. 
But they're just going to stay numbers; they're not going to become organisms. 
The holy man, Black Elk, said, "I did not know then how much was ended. 
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. 
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well. 
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play. 
So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger, at the same time. 
We just reorganized the markets. 
Hard power is there, and it will remain. 
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. 
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium, that light becomes literally a building material. 
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate. 
And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut, they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. 
He decided that he's going to take over the state, unofficially, and then officially, and then created this beautiful Region One policy. 
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it, but from my senses' point of view, that is combined together into one source of information. 
I live in society; I live in community. 
Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses, things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. 
If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll, where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago, the corals are doing better and there are sharks. 
You can see, for example, that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment. 
If you can see the complexity, you can see how tiny, little eddies and large eddies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature, but it's immensely complicated. 
They're living beings, and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water, and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change. 
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have. 
But we can't do everything. 
Thank you. 
It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet. 
The size of these boxes is bigger. 
But where does this sound, commonly described as a click, come from? 
They use techniques that he's never heard of, and for his half a million dollars in prize money, Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold. 
We watched TV; they make TV. 
So I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial. 
So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. 
(Applause) No. No. No. Wrong. 
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together. 
You know, innovation's hard work. 
This is what it looked like for three months. 
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube, and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower, just on the right species, what happens? 
Five years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups. 
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. 
But computers, they can. They don't need coffee breaks, they don't need vacations, they don't need to go to sleep at night, they don't ask for raises either. 
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side, and we run this as a business and I'll help you." 
When you play in a race, win! -- because when you win, the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods." 
Thank you. 
14 billion years in the past, 100 billion dog years, but an infinite number of years into the future. 
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal; Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya -- Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim and one-third animist, the community is -- Ollantaytambo, Peru, and Arctic Village, Alaska. 
And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves, to have the faculties to be able to deal with information, to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly. 
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say, a little ant walking around -- little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension, but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction. 
What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies? 
So when I show The Sims, I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims, not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi. 
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being. 
I see a lot of hands coming down. 
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool. 
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression. 
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable. 
I am an emotional, I am an emotional, incondotional, devotional creature. 
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition. 
There are many different types. 
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each. 
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. 
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?" 
So as you move vertically away from this surface, the heat falls off. 
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. 
But about three months after the launch of the condom company, I had a letter, a complaint, and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely. 
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either. 
He's a 17-year-old. 
But, anyway, that's where I grew up, in this little tofu factory in Seattle, and it was kind of like this: a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture. 
One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this, is actually increasing. 
This is looking down to the east, where the shooting vehicle sped off, and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers. 
But the point is, and the point was that every day of our lives is epic, and I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach, staggered up onto that beach, and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way, rehearsed what I would say on the beach. 
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina: too few crying children and smashed up houses. 
Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis." 
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. 
We would never do that in our own countries. 
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands. 
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories. 
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do? 
But let's not forget the hair. 
It's been around for about 7,000 years. 
And the things that they build amaze even themselves. 
That one's pretty good. It's getting better. 
OK, that's fair enough. 
I can peel off the layer of the lion. 
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there. 
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy, and we would get in to these meetings, and these managers would come in, and they would say, "Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know." 
So building clean government means, yes, provide money to the budget, but also provide a lot of scrutiny, which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money. 
It helped me realize something else during this project, is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult. 
What if we decided to make a different set of choices? 
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. 
And if you put those two facts together, it means that your experiences can change your connectome. 
These are children like Umar. 
Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money. 
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships, that have found these ways to collaborate. 
In fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of. 
All right, so I go back from TED, and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin, and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State." 
He was an expert in Latin American history. 
The U.S. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15th for the flu peak. 
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. 
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good, but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing, tiny amounts. 
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings: "I opened the door to my studio apartment. 
They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack. 
Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. 
Here, in fact, that's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency. 
So, what we did for the first two and a half years was four things: We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields, like cognitive psychology, spatial cognition, gender studies, play theory, sociology, primatology. 
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here, or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot -- but suppose they arrive and they give you a box. 
But what about the part that goes into the tumor? 
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these, and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it, so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net. 
(Applause) How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives, a moment of learning, a moment of challenge. 
So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. 
I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world, and that it's very important that we build it properly. 
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit. 
Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they're using credit cards. 
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. 
And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys. 
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. 
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think, of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him, it's a way of working with him, with his government. 
Africa was truly fascinating for me. 
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. 
The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge. 
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms. 
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there. 
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says, we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group. 
(Applause) So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy. 
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. 
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. 
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. 
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. 
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly. 
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. 
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it. 
It's moving by itself, okay. 
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations. 
Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit. 
So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields, the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water. 
Thank you. 
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so, what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it. 
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse. 
It isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness, the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives. 
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, "Right! How can I clap? OK, maybe ... (Claps) Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. 
For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. 
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here. 
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts, like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding, everything that's cooled in the supermarket, there's gelatin to make it look good. 
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. 
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest. 
And that was a surprise to me. 
(Laughter) He got dementia anyway. 
There is in a sense a computing essence. 
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic for the first time. 
Local TV news looms large, and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news. 
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording, understanding, learning information. 
There's no more relationship there. 
We will not be there. 
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential, and that's his voice. 
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. 
"But I'd get to see them in America." "No." 
Even if you want to have some gathering, before you go there, the police are already waiting for you. 
We barely break even. There is no fame in it. 
So this is the Ferraz family and the Novaes family. 
This building was wired for change. 
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old. 
Each one has got two games. 
And then he added, "But our water has no impurities." 
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs. 
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails, you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. 
They had access to satellite imagery. 
The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. 
From the first days and weeks of life, babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away. 
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma. 
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple. 
So, this is the short story of that research. 
It would be able to translate from one language to another. 
So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else? 
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. 
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. 
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space. 
And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids. 
And the game is very simple. 
There are very important people, business and land assets in Detroit, and there are real opportunities there. 
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958. 
It goes to bite me a second time. 
But I'm going to take some medication. 
Now, whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers, or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells, nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. 
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today. 
There was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked. 
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. 
The everyday world is determined by atoms, how they stick together to make molecules. 
That is to say, if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work, it will be applicable to a very, very large variety of human conditions, and hence, extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions. 
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery? 
We've said, well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired. 
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. 
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum, and that is a very clear signal. 
Now, when we tried to challenge this, going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down, we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right-wing Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman, who said he would join our brief only if the word "no brainer" was in the brief somewhere. 
We've shared transportation. 
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old. 
You can't stop thinking about another human being. 
As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said, "What a strange, long trip." 
Remarkable impact on mortality. 
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today. 
We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems. 
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers. 
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. 
It's political. There is so many parties to this project. 
So you want to go to that board meeting, but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. 
There's a false sense of security. 
(Applause) And there are all these animals, and all these people happy, and there's this economic value. 
And so, you know, for example, with these devices, patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges, not very much more, so nothing close to normal vision has been possible. 
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist. 
Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas." 
Everybody likes it, but some like it more than others. 
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'" And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone." 
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. 
The system we have today isn't fair to them. 
Here are some data on tariffs: starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent. 
And I got in the water with them, and I was amazed at how curious they were. 
The purpose of this project is, one: I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past. 
And these incredibly beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history, the Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape, and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage, but also an important part of our cultural heritage. 
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini, of Durga. 
Or in a parallel universe, you find this information. 
But actually they are cruel to themselves. 
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways; they're trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you'll be watching TV. 
So, as it comes over towards Malé I'm standing in Malé underneath the front. 
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. 
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work. 
So if you approach them from behind, down wind, you can push them over and they go thud in the mud." 
Now, this isn't going to be freaky. 
This is Michael and Benedicta, and they're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing -- and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support, whether you know it or not. 
Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health. 
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it. 
And when a big plant goes down, you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds, often for weeks or months, often without warning. 
Now we turn on our time lapse. 
We are doing a thousand now. 
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. 
I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made, but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes, other substances and a woman. 
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation, hippie parents. 
I put these all back, by the way. 
But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion. 
In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play. 
It was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through. 
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies. 
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart. 
"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault, but does it make you sad that others suffered?" 
The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda -- the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees, to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, holding six meters -- level rising, the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet, holding another seven meters -- sea level rising. 
On December 29th, U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war, using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun. 
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact. 
That's why we need sound immigration policy. 
It will stop because of the end of trade resources. 
Cricket wasn't always this speed-driven generations game. 
That's a big deal. 
I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. 
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. 
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. 
These were children who the whole world had given up on, who were flunking out of public school, and that's what they're capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence. 
Aging: The problem is enormous, 300,000 broken hips per year; but the solutions are extraordinary, and they include so many different things. 
And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts. 
This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas. 
My body had not only become a driven machine, but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. 
This is, of course, to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce. 
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map. 
This is not fiction, nothing at all. 
He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948. 
So I went out and researched ethanol, and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country. 
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it. 
I can look at your financial records. 
I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. 
And we made this small movie that I'd like to show. 
And in fact we can make fusion happen. 
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it. 
Questions like: "Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?" 
Yes, it's possible to do that. 
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. 
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way. 
That is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. 
It's a real pleasure to be here. 
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor, and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. 
On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated, even by, and I would say especially by, people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. 
And this is the first compelling business benefit. 
AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges. 
It goes out to a really long distance, compared to any of these other sorts of things. 
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people. 
And of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand, but this one, because it's a road bike, it all goes away and it folds into this little gap. 
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready. 
And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. 
This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines, and basically sort of abandoned buildings -- has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in, get high-speed internet access, learn computer programming skills for free. 
So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel -- is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. 
At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection, but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian, I said, "You know what, we need a Beretta." 
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff that affects heart health." 
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. 
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats, and now also domestic pet dogs. 
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. 
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events. 
And then I got my instructor rating. 
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors. 
I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. 
Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. 
For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch. 
At the age of 70, he is linking up something very creative. 
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years, and here comes the Internet, technology, BlackBerry, SMS. 
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. 
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. 
And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. 
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go. 
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. 
Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter. 
Think about war. 
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six. 
There is an extraordinary regularity. 
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes. 
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in. 
(Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. 
So if you look at it close enough, you'll actually see that much of this is about economics. 
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre, because I've got gray hair, and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future. 
And the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty, that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life. 
Eleven out of 14. 
Thank you very much. 
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world. 
Now, this is the very interesting part. 
That nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems, and they're integrated and beautifully robust. 
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras. 
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. 
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. 
All you have to do is read what you see. Right? 
As you probably know, in science, when you write a kind of special paper, only six or seven people read it. 
Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state? 
I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon. 
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight. 
They divide them farther. 
(Laughter) Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in]. 
And before you get to change the world, bad things are going to take place. 
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely help people, because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. 
(Laughter) So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. 
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot. 
10,000, two and a half million, 15 years. 
My watermaker broke, only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat. 
Significant problems remained. 
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter," and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African. 
It was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership. 
I've become the crazy wrongness lady. 
And, since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an 18 year-old with an AK-47, who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing, he can take a picture of it with his cellphone, send the picture back to where there is a doctor, and the doctor can look at it. 
And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking. 
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough. 
We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments. 
This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you, and it's interested in looking at you. 
So, the premise in the studio was, there are no boundaries, there is no fear. 
We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly. 
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us, something else?" 
And everywhere, were symbols of the Chinese -- everywhere, a constant reminder. 
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that. 
So to give you an idea of what that's like, I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle, and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak. 
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there. 
Moreover, Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative, which has been driving their choices for so long. 
Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. 
Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that. 
So this is gallbladder surgery. 
That is, I'm not a clinician, I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy. 
And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain's General Medical Council. 
The classic answer is to form an institution, right? 
The present portable device is far from optimally designed, both as to human factors as appearance. 
And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already, I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers, building electronic computers, which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers, which will build new electronic computers, and so forth. 
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. 
I did so for a simple reason. 
So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said, "Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride. 
The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident. 
So, you know, that's my last message to you. 
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. 
And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation, as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew, is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 
An escape hatch has been reached. 
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars that were hollowed out or something. 
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor. 
I think we save five of clubs. 
The live duck mounted the dead duck, and started to copulate. 
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. 
It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. 
And then it's a black hole. 
And that showed me such a fundamental truth, that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot. 
(Laughter) And they're really interested in how over-coddled we've become. 
You start to get into detail. 
CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Lennart Green! LG: Okay, thank you. 
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. 
And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. 
(Laughter) Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house. 
Great news. It drives me nuts that most people don't seem to know this news. 
And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. 
It seems quite vexing. 
Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process, and they elect a prime minister. 
We knew that during the war. (Laughter) A silver lining: It has kicked off globally, the quest to tackle food waste. 
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand. 
The dog says, "I don't think so." 
Namely, those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty. 
But no, you'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things -- pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps. 
And somebody has to see you and listen to you. 
That's going to have amazing impacts. 
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million. 
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project, which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. 
I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley. 
So is this a hopeless cause? 
So they figured not being able to see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk. 
For eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one -- inauguration day with gays in the military -- which was deft. 
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this. 
It's very difficult to start a private university. 
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it." 
(Laughter) So, we're down there, and this is at 400 feet -- that's looking straight up, by the way, so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is. 
But if you look at China, Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states, what's happening there is more troubling. 
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. 
Here is not like anywhere else. 
Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. 
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented. 
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, which I think is a pretty cool concept, although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. 
He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life. 
And that's what I came up with. 
Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours. 
For example, there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense, and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. 
It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe, and then this thing -- the title of that was, "There Goes the Neighborhood." 
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on. 
The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead. 
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test. 
(Laughter) So basically I'd completed the house. 
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. 
So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet, if you'll forgive me. 
If I come over here -- (Laughs) He's smart. 
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy, a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe. 
Now at the time that I was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment. 
We're on the verge of a whole new social science. 
Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations, but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter) But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic. 
But when you get your driving license, you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ. 
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves. 
But for the men here, I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk. 
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. 
It became a book. It became a show. 
Central Manhattan became possible. 
I flew out in front of the car, and then he ran over my legs. 
The fact is, the last mile is the problem, and half the world now lives in dense cities. 
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. 
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges. And I said, "This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap." 
So does a site like this have rules? 
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. 
The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right? 
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy." 
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive. 
They are stories about our people, for our people. 
We've made a good job. We've taken it out. 
He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. 
Why as a result, what happens? 
This is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history, and we absolutely have to get it right, and we have to get it right on our first and only try. 
It's not something I was very happy about. 
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions. 
This time, I'm going to talk about mental illness. 
But that strategy seldom takes you very far. 
EM: Well, we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe, the engines, the electronics and the launch operation. 
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke. 
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. 
I took school seriously, and for the first time ever in my life, I received an academic award for excellence, and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. 
And I've now made some glasses. That's it. 
Audience: Now! 
There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation. 
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet, and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press, a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace. 
Thank you very much. 
PH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment. 
Terrorists, they're rational. 
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. 
There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR, because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland, and by that, avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence. 
And she refused any help at all. 
That's why, I'm trying to say, it's like metro-nizing the bus. 
Everybody's welcome. 
It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. 
But we have a major shortage of organs. 
That's zero food waste. 
The exception was Japan. 
So, this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea. 
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn. 
He was just kind of writing about his life. 
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends. 
And I think, I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. 
In Shanghai, we were invited to build -- well we weren't invited; what am I talking about. 
I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic, because I don't just get hate mail. 
They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news. 
So, sure, we need to debate these things. 
Last March, we received very sad news. 
And equally, when it comes to climate change, every single country is going to have to make cuts. 
A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus, which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. 
Fast-forward. 
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up. 
So what's the problem? 
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up. 
And the same idea to use there, to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable. People enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall, which is chilled down and which is cooled. We wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon, even in these sunny and hot summer months, and they can enjoy and meet there with their families. (Applause) And the same concept: shade against the sun, shade against the wind, and use, use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint. 
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre. 
And so it's going to try to watch your response. 
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works? 
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. 
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up. 
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized. 
Really cool term: neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. 
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients. 
Start with the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors, most of them, are in a fee-for-service system. They are basically incentivized to do more -- procedures, tests, prescribe medications. 
You can work for a small company, in a boring branch. 
Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men. 
That's called the grandmother effect. 
It's only half the length of this one. 
So what's happening here? 
Well you might have, but I don't think so. 
We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases, but in fact, having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. 
These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India. 
And so that's just programmed into you. 
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves. 
And to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems. 
In this context I'll just show you a few. 
When I moved to Boston, I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society. 
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP. 
I mean, astounding; no one has this. 
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. 
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute? 
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. 
Mother Theresa, she was rational. 
It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before, so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon. 
Well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty. 
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. 
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to." 
We can make a difference, and make a difference, not just for women, but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. 
Even now we are in touch through Facebook. 
And then, of course, there's climate change, and we all know about climate change. 
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug, and they're effectively normal now. 
This is an ocean planet. 
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?" 
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. 
The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry. 
This is a flying buttress. 
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing. 
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms. 
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little. (Laughter) I repeated the experiment there. 
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. 
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing." 
This is how we excise cancers. 
I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests, but they still had a neurologic issue. 
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning. 
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments, but they cannot change policies. 
And you can see this PET scan of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET. 
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon is David Karp. 
They're just icons; you click on them. 
CA: And they don't disturb you? 
The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. 
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary. 
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it. 
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years. 
Then what happens to the waste? 
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. 
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land. 
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather -- yes, make a beautiful website, who am I to say don't make a beautiful website? 
They must not remain anonymous. 
Man's best friend in the fight against malaria. 
So I would go and collect for all the papers. 
Be spectacular like Theseus, who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur. 
And over there I experienced other people's suffering, up close and personal, immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories, and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. 
(Music) (Applause) Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb. 
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin. 
And it's been a great motivator. 
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech. 
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean? 
Well, the World Bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10.3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries. 
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. 
There is just one reference point, which is the body. 
And there you see the stagecoach driver, and he goes, on the top panel, He goes A, B, C, D, E, F. 
We've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor, fueled by this information technology. 
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things. 
He talked to the head man of a person in rural Russia. 
Over 50 new countries were born. 
And therefore it will become intolerable -- what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. 
This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. 
That is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way. 
(Laughter) And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing, but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment. 
Now the second example of customization -- and by the way, you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals, so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals. 
These were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having. 
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity. 
I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view. 
So this is what I looked like by the end. 
I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole, and what its Schwarzschild radius is. 
You read about it, you hear about it. 
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence. 
So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. 
These are plausible claims, but in truth, we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true. 
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. 
This can be as effective as Ritalin. 
Change happens slowly. 
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all. 
And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. 
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told, whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal. 
They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors. 
So this is where they are today. 
DH: I don't get it. (Applause) (Laughter) DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks. 
In fact, when I got back to Detroit, my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company, and certainly by those in the industry. 
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track -- that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket, you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. 
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. 
It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker. 
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy when they do that, our worries, our anxieties, our regrets, and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind-wandering at all. 
We set them off on this air hockey table. 
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month. 
But the question arises: Okay, so how much do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall? 
There is nothing about him that says, "I am about to fight you like this." 
They did it by draining the land. 
Well, let me ask you, what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you? What do you do? You do this. 
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA. 
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. 
(Laughter) Well, go to a museum, you'll see, see how many baby dinosaurs there are. 
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. 
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it's growing constantly. 
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss. 
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. 
And in fact, customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range. 
I want to add a third element. I want to add model. 
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz (Laughter) -- and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents. 
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. 
But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership working behind the scenes, almost unknown, I'm sure to most of you here today. 
CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe, what fee would you have to charge, and can you actually make the business work? 
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. 
But you can still hear that faint call. 
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you. 
And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model. 
You see, there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure, when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing, you were good at math, you could build things, you were an astronaut, an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau, you could jump higher, run faster, kick harder than anyone. 
But to me, things aren't the future. 
It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. 
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt, it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. 
That fills me with almost sexual excitement. 
The croc again continues to shake me. 
You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this; water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. 
In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. 
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant? 
Thank you very much. 
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. 
Sometimes I would win, mostly he would win, but we both enjoyed them. 
(Music) Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude. 
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast. 
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running, let alone having, you know, software problems. 
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10, otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph. 
The kid had no patience for him. 
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern. 
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb. 
ready, just play some time. 
And how you think about what you're experiencing, your beliefs about the essence of it, affect how it hurts. 
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy, then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing, but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building." 
So it runs frequently, the entire hospital, just on a generator. 
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile, and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs, but once we made this, we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water. 
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world. 
And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that, but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. 
Now, 60 years later, I'm here to tell you why it's possible. 
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans. 
And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding. 
How do you design that nozzle? 
We said, so we'll put in a stent, but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. 
Now to the funds we raise, and research, and how we're redefining research. 
But I just started to shoot these pictures. 
And what Rayan did then is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half, and he looked at me and he said, "Baba, I want you to come with me to my office in my house. 
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater, when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. 
Because they would have done extraordinarily well. 
Thank you. 
Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be? 
Television comes quite a bit larger. 
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring. 
(Laughter) Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories. 
It is a cost-effective approach. 
But it's a very simple and easy technique. 
(Applause) I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now, ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan. 
It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit. 
(Laughter) And even now, a decade and a half later, even now that we are married, I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room. 
So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. 
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere. 
The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable. 
The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter) But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. 
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately, in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days, in one year, in 10 years? 
Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping? 
You should be in the art department." 
Harvest palms, smoke. 
Now who is rational? 
Bihar represents the challenge of development: abject poverty surrounded by corruption. 
Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned, yes from the positives in Asia and India, but also the negatives? 
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one." 
People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. 
Secondly, we can use materials. 
These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. 
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth. 
As I walked out, her pace slowed. 
You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. 
The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. 
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife, and what I've done for hundreds of other patients. 
So now suppose we test them all. 
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions: Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity. 
Can you spot the difference? 
In fact, about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore, particularly China and India, and we don't have a governance system. 
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. 
And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit. 
There are many biological systems like that -- brains, cells, developing embryos. 
So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness, which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. 
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad. 
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. 
And faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war. 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. 
(Laughter) Who folded that thing up there, and why? 
Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. 
They help companies and other designers think better about the future. 
So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version: Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing? 
This is no hypothetical question. 
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College. 
Well ... 
It could be, by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace. 
And so in some sense they literally, they had such a symbolic view of mathematics, they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them. 
Babies play, kids play, adults play. 
But it could be very different, because having access to those state-backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service. 
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. 
And when you're dealing with grammar, which is, you know, incredibly dry, E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and, you know, there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question? 
But to her, it mattered deeply. 
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. 
I'm telling you you didn't shave." 
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it. 
It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. 
Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. 
I'm an artist and an engineer, which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid. 
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand, soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. 
In reality, much of the force I led looked exactly like you. 
Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this, and even there, it is him who advises them. 
There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion. 
We've got several different species of agriculture coming along, and I'm hoping that soon we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria. 
I conceived the kind of airplane. 
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes. 
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. 
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. 
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old, a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice. 
And if the demo gods are willing, in about 10 seconds or so we should see it. 
So much for promises. 
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. 
That's what I really want to focus on. 
And technology has set us free -- this is free WiFi. 
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions, we need to think about them in this way. 
Historically, we've always acted as victims of something or somebody. 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here on earth to help others. 
Thank you. 
In "Brave New World," he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. 
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans. 
Health models are a great example. 
So we also face risks. 
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else. 
It's about the size of a rugby ball. 
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools? 
And one of the most tedious ones, I think, was saying that beauty was about symmetry. 
And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK. 
And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. 
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA. 
So be decisive on these issues. 
It may come from Wagyu cattle, but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. 
It's a very wuzzy line. 
Magnetic data storage -- that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots, different engineers, different companies, same exponential process. 
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough, the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. 
And this forest is quite different. 
The Paige typesetter had 18,000 parts. 
So purple is "fighting," and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering." 
To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland, and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. 
And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -- she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn. 
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. 
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey. 
The world does not need any more tar mines. 
I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing. 
The next artist is K. M. Yoon, a really interesting South Korean artist. 
That's it. Please save this. 
Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies, and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances, and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion. 
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult. 
But actually, a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. 
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. 
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania. 
Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact. 
This is Calms Forte, 32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that. 
So everyone's back in the room, okay. 
I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks. 
And we must rebuild these forests. 
(Laughter) So when it comes down to our end cretaceous, we have seven left. 
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology, this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas, and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years, which is an advantage for the developing world. 
(Laughter) I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg. 
But the green building, on behind, you can see that the top floor is not occupied, so people are building with the possibility of expansion. 
There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way. 
But I actually came to this issue in a different way. 
And then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier. 
And this really got me excited because again, we found the same pattern: the more people change, the more it affected the growth of their tumors. 
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries. 
But it occurred to me, how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done, that we must have done it. 
So what happens is you dance on the grave, and after you've done your dance, everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are. 
How, you know, what have I lost? 
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago. 
The classic media problem, from the 20th century is, how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network. 
They are really excelling. 
I'll come back after two months. 
And I was rather taken aback. 
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be. 
So this is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer. 
But believe me, there are more polite ways to offer assistance. 
Who killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did, because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change in a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his limited imagination, could never have conceived. 
And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world. 
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships. 
We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. 
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that. 
There is trade, there is disarmament, there is cross-border relations. 
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care, comparable to the best anywhere in the world, can be done in a developing country environment. 
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact, that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter) Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs, one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong, and I'll tell you about some of that tonight. 
But we have to draw those people in, because this is about education. 
(Laughter) Okay, so that guy is actually still with us. 
His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois. 
And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing? 
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor, was one of the first men in to clear up the mess. 
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time. 
But California, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff, we also, unfortunately, lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. 
It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it. 
And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. 
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections, one we called the general election, the second we should call the money election. 
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular. 
Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. 
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go. 
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories. 
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. 
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators -- there are many more than that on the planet -- 10 million SOLEs, 180 billion dollars and 10 years. 
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent? 
I guess that's better living through bugs. 
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo. 
She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning, almost a turmoil, against the credibility of Red Cross. 
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound. 
By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness. 
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox. 
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. 
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles. 
It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels, but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us. 
(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time. 
I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers, and I was watching the world go by, had a few more beers, and the conversation turned to '70s fashion — (Laughter) — and how everything manages to come back into style. 
So close your eyes for a minute. 
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start. 
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to. 
Chimborazo! 
When we're dealing with people like this? 
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K., that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work. 
So what is between thinking and doing? 
You run up to 15,000 feet, descend 3,000 feet. 
We can then choose, from among a range of options, the best one. 
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home after the Trojan War. 
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin. 
Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution. 
The mushrooms then are harvested, but very importantly, the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. 
And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone, where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't. 
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people, who had no immunity to them at all. 
The main unit will then go inside the brain. 
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic. 
At this point, he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live. 
But how do you do that? 
(Audience: Integrity.) DSR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy! And that's a straight line we got right over there. And I didn't even prompt him. 
And of course, our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here. 
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country, not even speaking the language, to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. 
And by the way, these are my favorites -- externalities calculation and green carbon markets. 
These changes are coming. 
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes, and therefore we love it. 
I don't have time to explain it, but it has to do with DNA and RNA. 
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister. 
And every part can be transformed; every frog can be transformed in a prince. 
That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture. 
Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas, and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons. 
You can't go and order it yet, but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men. 
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures. 
So let's start looking at some of those. 
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around 2,000 years old. 
You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of 48 hours of cholera, alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats. 
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance. 
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment. 
It's about supply and availability. 
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them. 
(Applause) I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character. 
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me. 
(Laughter) But I want to tell you something useful -- and here it is, so concentrate now. 
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material. 
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. 
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that. 
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out. 
The title is "This Happened." 
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them -- to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. 
Chapter 12 highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making, but becomes their own. 
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility. 
Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me -- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very -- you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody, everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example, is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City. 
It will really make us question what it is to be a human being. 
And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. 
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted; Superman was a foster child; Cinderella was a foster child; Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, was fostered and institutionalized; Batman was orphaned; Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights" was fostered; Jane Eyre, adopted; Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;" Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter) Moses! (Laughter) -- the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;" Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;" Luke Skywalker -- Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) -- Oliver Twist; Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying; Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple." 
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall, some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface, creating islands like Hawaii. 
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses, and kids have bought in here. 
And so it came in from the outside. 
It even has its own name, with Weibo. 
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese. 
He got 100 percent in all the important things, like nursery rhymes, for example there. 
But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. 
There's a good person. 
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events, and our bodies have adapted. 
And this word here, George Bush called this war a crusade. 
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules, evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives. 
Now, since you guys are really great, maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. 
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. 
And any of these can be clicked, and then the narrative is entered at that position. 
But let's go back to the Higgs field. 
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi, and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi. 
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that's why it's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine, which is a computer. 
The other thing I felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life. 
But out in the landscape, one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles of bulldozed desert. 
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters who were great at making with their hands. 
The second is a population of students that studied but with a mastery-based approach, so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one. 
When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. 
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. 
I can't believe it." 
Can you go there? 
(Applause) It's a great honor to be here with you. 
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system. 
And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?" 
This is: "Having" -- this is the same thing; it's just, you know, photographed from the side. 
Josh. 
Now, not being able to see meant, of course, that you taught yourself. 
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. 
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17. 
So you guys did pretty good, cool. 
There's a new quality in this work. 
So they went for plan B. 
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. 
And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is, what do we validate in our children, and what do we cure in them? 
And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity, or the patterns of how things are connected. 
So we collect this MR. 
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter) For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter) And you like technology, right? 
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent, until the broadcasters finally got together and said, okay, enough of this. 
Now, modern slavery: according to State Department rough statistics, there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders. 
And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for. 
Now, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others. 
This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy, where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid. 
And if you cut into an older dinosaur, it's very massive. 
I witnessed the technical difficulty. 
This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. 
Some things are certain, I think. 
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. 
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040. 
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization. 
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you? 
Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters. 
It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us. 
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places. 
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. 
So what ended up happening, actually, is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water. 
And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest about half the size of the adult. 
And that's -- (Laughter) -- that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me. 
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. 
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size. 
You see, history's rich in irony. 
And she makes all the deals. 
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela. 
I can feel your noise. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight. 
In absence of the code, because, you know, video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases, in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company. 
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case. 
The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election, way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 -- (Laughter) the year Alberto Giacometti (Laughter) made "The Palace at Four in the Morning." 
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. 
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand. 
But reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year. 
(Laughter) Not many people can say that. 
And so I've brought a couple of them with me. 
And we've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi, where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture. 
They can swim at the same speed day and night -- that's faster than any Olympic swimmer. 
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity, as well as an enormous social problem. 
This is a SOLE in Newcastle. 
And again, I think this will be a world record. 
I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way, and it taught me how to draw superheroes, how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman. 
In a very short period of time, completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such, and we had to get up and leave; it was just that uncomfortable. 
Let's have our cars go at 60 miles per hour. 
And if we can find that, then we'll be able to find, within each one of us, what it is that we need to find to face the big question, which is: how do we change? 
They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. 
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles. 
Not me, that was for sure. 
And within a few months after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow. 
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin. 
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions. 
In fact, the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing. 
Either God is responsible for the tsunami, or God is not in control. 
Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this. 
So a group of babies came in and listened to English. 
How do we solve it? 
Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers, and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say, there are insights to be gleaned there. 
He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned. 
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. 
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine, "Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi." 
Let's do one in L.A." 
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow. 
And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80. 
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever. 
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones -- which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse. 
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar." 
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome. 
Can you just encompass these people too? 
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed. 
(Laughter) I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes. 
It was easily transmitted, but, luckily, was pretty mild. 
I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman, even when he did what he did. 
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. 
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. 
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker. 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. 
Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it, and I love the mud on my legs and feet. 
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot. 
So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. 
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. 
Why would you choose rats? 
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway? 
These form part of a grouping system much as the stars do. 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really. 
And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were. 
So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before; imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. 
It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising. 
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable. 
They then go on to create an event, and beyond that, a foundation to support that. 
We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it. 
Look at what their parents says. 
And here's the simplest version in nature, and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane. 
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. 
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. 
ELA: People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. 
Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.) DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. 
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time, decided not to go into computers. 
When we look at this new unified pattern, we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing. 
I'm convinced of it. 
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. 
My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart. 
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. 
And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light. 
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. 
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't, and then she showed them an anomaly. 
How can metronomes communicate? 
The name of this track is "The Magic To Come." 
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. 
It does this in a couple of ways -- chasing productivity, which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. 
They want to be missed the day they don't show up. 
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it. 
Executive Office of the President. 
You know what? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. 
But do you know what the crucial thing is? 
So, it was going nowhere. 
You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. 
And I want to demonstrate that that, too, is a dangerous myth, very dangerous. 
And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class. 
What has happened? 
It's financeable in the private capital market. 
So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for, and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict, that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous, and the consequences will be fantastic. 
Thank you for your attention. 
And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes, a number so beautiful, so massive, I think it will blow your mind. 
And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times, and it isn't looking good. 
He'd had cataract surgery. 
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet, anywhere. 
(Laughter) And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person, and that's what authenticity is all about. 
One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown. 
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. 
We all know, and there's been several allusions to it, that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists, engineers and technicians. 
It's also an idea that we have forgotten. 
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars for a 300-series car, and a person paying 70,000 dollars for a 700 series, and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car. 
Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. 
You're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion, because that's what I've done most of my life. 
(Applause) Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. 
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie. 
So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling "technology stew." 
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by, not only making it a social event -- I think good use of behavioral economics in that, if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated, your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone. 
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan. 
It doesn't animate them. 
We're talking about something very similar here. 
But right now we don't have enough of that. 
We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain, or maybe even ice; a robot that can run like a cheetah, or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human. 
But everything else is just lying there. 
And with that in mind, I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading. 
The rest of the time they're delocalized. 
What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done, and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof. 
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person. 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. 
But it's actually not a new field. 
Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
One is a supermarket standard: white bread, pre-packaged, which I'm told is called a Wonderbread. 
A double outhouse over here on the side. 
I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer, where it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot. 
(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon? 
Why? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V. 
NK: He never saw it finished, Pop. 
(Laughter) Anybody interested in that? 
Thank you. 
How early can a rock performance begin? 
They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved." 
And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. 
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers, and they work really well. 
I want to give you a demo of a prototype that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall. 
Whatever. 
These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them. 
They're in denial. 
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be? 
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now, because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites, and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact. 
Anyway, while we're here, again, if you want to visit anything, all you need to do is double-click. 
And he proposed this machine called the memex. 
Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF, is about as intentional as agriculture. 
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq. 
I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine. 
Thanks. 
We lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years. 
So, I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid, because she's very old and fragile. 
Bugs Bunny is my muse. 
I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: "Why didn't I go into banking?" 
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to." 
So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don't know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers -- somebody else's computers -- to these guys. 
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way, look at pilgrimage. 
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism. 
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. 
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate, I really started focusing on what we would teach them. 
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him. 
We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge. 
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane. 
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. 
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down. 
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli. 
Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology. 
(Music) [Basque] (Music) Thank you. 
(Laughter) A very different feeling. 
But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy. 
If you ask them, they'll say, "Well, you know the coal, we need the coal. 
That is the ethos found, too, in all the religions. 
For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor. 
Here you see the patent practices before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95, before antiretroviral drugs. 
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else. 
The threat, in fact, is this inversion of the burden of proof, where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create, to produce or to share. 
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras. 
The economies of the future depend on that. 
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different. 
And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that? 
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country, whereas in India, it's all men. 
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film, maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young. 
Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. 
Let's click down now to the decade scale. 
And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. 
All right! It calls for celebration. 
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. 
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying -- and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes." 
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. 
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody, he doesn't call. 
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day. 
It was made by a Russian that's designed most of the suits of the past 18 years for the Soviets. 
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So this turned into a contest. 
And my father came out, he was so proud. 
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0 we'll solve everything within the car itself." 
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people. 
And in the U.N., you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities. 
What is the state of science? 
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress. 
I had a heart catheterization, where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20. 
So, I'm graduating college and, feeling very idealistic, I decided to join the NGO which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former Soviet Union. 
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. 
It was fantastic. 
Now let's look at another part of the world, the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans. 
There's a second thing I like about this. 
They are taking responsibility. 
It's how you cover it that matters. 
It's just symbolism. 
And so seven stars would stand for "elu meen," which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. 
Just from the perspective of climate change, the average urban dweller in the U.S. 
Now this is really an interesting project. 
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. 
Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. 
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience. 
You may never experience the entire thing yourself. 
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come. 
They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. 
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem, we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved. 
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow. 
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. 
We have on the screen a representative sample of 100 Americans. 
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means. 
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. 
His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical. 
War child, child without a mama, still fighting in the saga. 
And to put it really bluntly, you know, people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right? 
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust, and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers. 
Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have. 
As recently at last decade, most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. 
This is what I'm building now -- they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments. 
Based on that we are announcing, here at TED, in true TED tradition, Singularity University. 
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful. 
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this. 
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest. 
Their average age is 102. 
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. 
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. 
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese. 
It just came out six months ago, and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. 
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am." 
And so the next question was: What happens when musicians are trading back and forth, something called "trading fours," which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment? 
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. 
Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!" 
And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by. 
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before. 
Bill's hasn't. 
But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA, which is technically very difficult to get. 
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it. 
Maybe you think I have the cards in order already, so you help me to shuffle again. 
And then this is Anthony. 
In fact, we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had. 
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area. 
So you use it with your headset. 
And basically, it's a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component. 
Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war. 
This is so I can share my experiences with others. 
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. 
Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. 
They will remain the most powerful nation, but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world.

There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain. 
We have to fix our immigration policy. 
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath, and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena, or a gymnasium.

You, you survive. It's OK. 
So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. 
What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results.

It's not whose army wins; it's also whose story wins. 
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience. 
And here's the building as it opened, with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.

And I often look at things as though they're food. 
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible. 
And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!" 
Now if you think about it, in the age before GPS and radar, that was obviously a really difficult problem. 
And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container. 
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case. 
It's going to be "check your body" light, and go in and get it taken care of. 
So, perspective is everything and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about, I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. 
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. 
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. 
It's still quicker to do that and more practical. 
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. 
But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do, this concept we had, was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?" 
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. 
And the secret is she opens every single one. 
That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs) You know, as for me, my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. 
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking. 
The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually, there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance.

Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered. 
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace, the next tower is the Ministry of Finance, and there's a lot of connection with us today, so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay? 
The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov, a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine. 
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world. 
But basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you. 
So most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities. 
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants -- those are the leaders. 
And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass. 
Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this, and it's better if we think hard about it, even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. 
And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design. 
So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production, is higher as well as the overwintering survival, compared to rural areas. 
I started writing fiction at the age of eight. 
This leads to this question. 
So we count many, many such planets, and they have different sizes. 
Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level, 60 percent of medicines were prospected, were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. 
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. 
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith, you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species. 
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are. 
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries. 
So they are now sending the character back into that world. 
When I first went to Hollywood, they said -- I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me, "Would you kindly not talk about subtext?" 
Next is Roy Penig, a really interesting Kentucky artist, and he's the nicest guy. 
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. 
So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. 
I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. 
And as I mentioned, when it started, we were at the Globe, and there was no press. 
Our humming will be drumming. 
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth. 
And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior. 
That's why it's so important. 
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.

How's it going? 
We teach photography. 
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them." 
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on. 
Because there's another way of seeing it. 
So that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea in order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning, but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. 
We feel good if we give. 
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch, then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. 
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models. 
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree. 
Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and I doubt that it's several hundred. 
We observe the cells in a plate, and they're just on the surface. 
And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds, making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. 
There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. 
Terrorists are doing this.

We're going to move even further down, and go to one single electron spin. 
They have no education and no freedom. 
This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy, along the periphery of the sphere of influence, fully funding arms organizations. 
The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids. 
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto, which is in Portugal. 
Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see, hear, feel a lot more than ever before, generating prodigious amounts of data. 
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes, a Ferrari engine, a Volvo body, a BMW chassis. 
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label. 
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. 
We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago. 
RT: My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence? 
The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon, he'll take the techniques of George Church and get passenger pigeon DNA, the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew, get that DNA into chicken gonads, and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs, and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. 
That number probably needs to double. 
"Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom, I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola." 
We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.

Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light -- come in, and they just squish around the cell, and they come back the other side. 
It's a compound curve interior. 
The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is. 
If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world, then that means, who is left to deal with them, who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?

At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?" 
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints, arms tied, arms and legs tied down, arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest.

And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras. 
Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer? 
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts. 
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either. 
We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. 
The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. 
Hnugginn: is it a happy word, or a sad word? 
User-generated content, spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these, celebrating amateur culture. 
(Laughter) So ideally what you want to do is a trial. 
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen. 
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships. 
My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled. 
It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning.

So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell, but a community which we call an organism. 
This doesn't make any sense. 
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. 
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. 
I have a playlist of about 85 songs, and especially in the middle of the night, and that night, because we use no lights -- lights attract jellyfish, lights attract sharks, lights attract baitfish that attract sharks, so we go in the pitch black of the night. 
Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here this last week, surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster? 
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here. 
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow, I think, is incredibly exciting. 
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies, usually Chinese or Japanese.

So this is the project. Here's how it started. 
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks ... etc., etc. 
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale, significant and long-term resource investment, the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds, and for individuals, consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse that we really want as consumers, and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise, and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation. 
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas. 
His name is Paul Offit. 
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris, a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office. 
If you look back in history, Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes, was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller, to begin to think about, could you culture organs? 
(Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. 
And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family, but I didn't remember my own past.

We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere, contributing to global climate change, no doubt. 
It's a social science that recognizes -- much like science recognizes the complexity of the body, biology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize the complexity of the human mind. 
So the morning the FDA was going to meet, this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. 
In 2002, we started a new institute, the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, where we set out two goals: One, to understand the impact of our technology on the environment, and how to understand the environment better, and two, to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life. 
The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. 
Tortured to death. 
They would say wolves. 
They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.

You see insects, you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies, frogs, snakes, eagles. 
The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas, is doubling every decade, according to our models. 
You then have some anatomic descriptions, you get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver." 
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. 
Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure: horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines going across, these magenta squiggles, the workmen being reduced to decorative elements, just a nice, kind of, breakup of the urban place. 
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them, one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.

And Whewell not only coined the term scientist, as well as the words anode, cathode and ion, but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides. 
And to tell you the truth, I never really bought into this argument, in part because I never saw three American presidents agree on anything else in the past. 
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA," teaching people how to do business so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business. 
And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world. 
So if you look, as I did, through this tour, and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions, look at the recipes that they come up with for learning, they look nothing like school. 
What color are the bears at the North Pole?" 
Boom. 
And what is the message that is coming, what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building and how is it informing us about who we are? 
Texting, email, posting, all of these things let us present the self as we want to be. 
I thought it was an idea worth spreading, and I think it must be, can be, could be replicated elsewhere. 
I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993. 
I also translate weather data into musical scores. 
It's a really fun way to explore the lecture, and, I hope, a fitting homage. 
You know, with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. 
It was a dimly lit shack. 
One, that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; two, that we will always be heard; and three, that we will never have to be alone. 
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. 
(Applause) Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so I've never seen color, and I don't know what color looks like, because I come from a grayscale world. 
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car. 
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly? 
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold, you disappear, both to yourselves and to others. 
In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population. 
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about.

CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car. 
The horses are completely handmade. 
This is a tremendously complicated process. 
It involves limited raw materials. 
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. 
What could I do? 
There it is. 
And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected. 
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing -- any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing, if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization, and went in and talked about it. 
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida, and you can introduce that queen. 
There is no equality in the United States.

Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness. 
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together. 
That means, we can imagine -- I don't say it was fantastic, but in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized. 
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model. 
The boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change. 
And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong, it's extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda. 
In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. 
But can you reconcile that? 
The government has invested in basic education, has invested in basic health. 
(Applause) The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me. 
If there is one for me, this is it. To help this happen. 
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem -- so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. 
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic. 
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river, like sand mining, for example, very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge, not allowing the animals to breed anymore, we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial, despite the early good intentions. 
They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say, "Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things that put them in a special category." 
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater. 
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard. 
(Applause) Why can't we solve these problems? 
So, you know, that leads to questions like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine? 
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing. 
They were taking videos of buildings shaking. 
What can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future?

I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. 
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing, so they have to take their shoes off, get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold, and do that kind of work. 
So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos, and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did. 
But now, a few months on, however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face, as someone once put it, they can't hide their uncertainty. 
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us. 
The yellow line shows us the most likely path. 
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid. 
One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. 
In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves. 
They're very mobile. You cannot tax them. 
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails, pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. 
So this project also, because of its involved practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is, if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice. 
People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor ... 
I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended. 
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease.

Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions? 
But he's persistent. 
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins? 
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. 
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed. 
I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. 
So we're not going to be able to do that today? 
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record. 
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa. 
The science is that simple. 
We make lots of toys with newspapers, and this is one of them. 
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. 
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. 
(Laughter) I'm very interested in wonder, in design as an impetus to inquiring. 
There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. 
And so, there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature, and this reminds me of it. 
So, as the president now reassures us, we are on track to achieve our goals. 
Right? Like, seriously, nobody would do this. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Sometimes you turn on the news and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?" 
Now when I screamed at my children to stop, sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder. 
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!" 
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data, trends and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere. 
So it meant if you attacked us, we would attack you virtually simultaneously, and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. 
How will you cook your chicken now? 
Over millions of years, variation and selection, variation and selection -- trial and error, trial and error. 
ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside, a little bit toward the middle for me. 
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students who are soldiers in territory that owns them. 
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. 
(Thumping) Now it's gone. 
(Laughter) I was seeing if you were listening. 
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that." 
If you live up here, in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down, but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere, and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out, and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter. 
They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent, etc. -- before the surgery. 
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way? 
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is, if you can preserve it in the right way, which we can do with bamboo peels. 
It's also increasing fixing CO2s, sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. 
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young &amp; Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. 
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?" 
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. 
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. 
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. 
And eventually we got lucky. 
How predictive is it? 
But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. 
So I'll be talking about each of those today. 
And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed. 
This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided. 
(Laughter) This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen. 
That is the resource that I'm talking about. 
Third box is out. The fourth box is out. 
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't. 
I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. 
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study, they're going to take my entire genomic sequence, all of my medical information, and my identity, and they're going to post it online for everyone to see. 
Take the 19th century, for example. 
We're trying to get to the point of automation. 
I can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because I'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders. 
In fact, I design nuclear reactors. 
So in Africa, there's been more time to create genetic diversity." 
That would be appalling, and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. 
A banana peel on the tarmac. 
And so perception actually is leaky in any case. 
And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. 
And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero. 
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us, because the street furniture had not yet arrived. 
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. 
When you have a patent, you can exclude anyone else from making, from producing or making low-cost versions, for example, available of those medications. 
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. 
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school, a military takeover happened in my country, a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope, and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest. 
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. 
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists. 
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be, because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears. 
Such an amazing story. 
Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? 
(Laughter) Eva Zeisel: Are you sure? 
It's like the blind leading the clueless. 
This is a problem of such and such a type, and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. 
Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy. 
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent. 
And you can see, the world is crazily green. 
Let's talk about what's going on today. 
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams. 
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever. 
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists, that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years. 
Yes we can. We can do it. 
One is through improper nurturing. 
But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys, or to include the women mayors, homies. 
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream. 
Let me show you what that would look like. 
What's the process of telling a story? 
These women have toxic breast milk. 
If you're against, put up one. 
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers. 
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. 
So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest. 
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover. 
♫ I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon ♫ ♫ And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune ♫ ♫ Me! What would I be? Me! ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me? ♫ ♫ What would I be? ♫ ♫ What would I be? Me! ♫ ♫ Another starving refugee ♫ ♫ What would I be? ♫ ♫ What would I be? Me! ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah!♫ ♫ Yeah, Yeah! ♫ ♫ I would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫ 
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion, they work silently, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day. 
If you listen to the way black youth today speak, think about the use of the word "yo." 
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. 
Anyone can kill me, or you, or you. 
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things. 
But we've also got to get consumption down. 
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform. 
He said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal." 
In the background, my bicycle. 
(Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes. 
So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great. 
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. 
The next headwind is education. 
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem, especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up, was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter) With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem. 
Mark Twain says that proper preparation, or teaching, is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good, it can turn awful practices into powerful ones, it can change men and transform them into angels. 
Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio. 
So when I was born, I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me. 
So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator, which didn't work out for us, to optimize the Stirling engine, and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar, irrespective of weight, irrespective of size, to get the most conversion of solar energy, because the sun is free. 
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. 
And I try to figure out how that works. 
What's next? What's next is going to be people. 
We have so much power today, it is up to us to figure out what to do, and that's the good news. 
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down! 
And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something. 
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. 
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope. 
(Music) (Applause) Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run "S-Curve music?" 
And I think you'd have to be really authentic, you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to. 
And so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit, and I tried not to interrupt them. 
So is this really possible? 
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk. 
So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever. 
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. 
So we've got, what, 17 more years to go or so before China's bigger. 
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm, vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone. 
Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one, with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. 
Take child mortality; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, from 1990 to 2015. 
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid. 
It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. 
Right? If I had given this talk last year, I couldn't do what I just did, because I couldn't have found those photos. 
These are the images that are automatically constructed. 
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. 
So that's open-source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law. 
(Laughter) I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn't call me from Stockholm. 
Why does she do that job? 
How does that play out in terms of application to a disease? 
(Laughter) It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there. 
Does this sound familiar to you? 
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. 
And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses, and it would be a great benefit to everybody. 
The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects, as you see on the right. 
And it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. 
Well the range is quite a bit. 
So may each of you live lives of immersion. 
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island -- and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs." 
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer." 
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each. 
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery, so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example. 
NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this. 
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the West -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West. 
He contacted me immediately and said, whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside, his doors are always open. 
And he, somehow, has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong. 
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. 
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise, because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. 
This is actually a picture of a salamander. 
I created a video which was based on a Wireside Chat that I'd given, and I uploaded it to YouTube. 
He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood. 
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. 
I've got no plans." 
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. 
(Laughter) I had to have long conversations with my wife. 
But now, you ask me, but what about war, the war on cancer? 
And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change. 
It can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people, because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us, as long as we keep leadership something beyond us, as long as we make it about changing the world, we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other. 
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money. 
The adoptive parents were lined up. 
(Laughter) But I thought I'd take this opportunity -- there's a few people from Pakistan in here. 
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. 
We kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go to the cave. We were ready. 
CA: One minute. (Laughter) LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven, resourceful, and the thing that struck me, what they want most is education, to learn, because most of them come from very poor backgrounds. 
Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said, "If you want to build a flotilla of ships, you don't sit around talking about carpentry. 
And what we see, we do see language areas lighting up, but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing, you've got major visual areas lighting up. 
Well, because it helps them get through the day. 
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more. 
Here's one -- a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail. 
Infrastructure everywhere. 
You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks. 
As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp. 
What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level, and when you've had it all, sometimes, guys, they die on the vine with all of that talent, and one of the things we've had, all of us, is fame, I think the best kind of fame, because you can take it off. 
So, you know, I realized when I was there, General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America, in that he's known for chicken and not war. 
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. 
It's not the whole robot yet, we're working on it -- now you can see how it's attaching.

Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. 
So for instance, here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life. 
And in that space station we have the genetic material, the chromosomes, within a nucleus. 
So for example using your thumb under with C major. 
It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. 
And one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains. 
No? Now? 
The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men's sperm or just their own. 
There's an aversion to word problems, which describes 99 percent of my students. 
What we call today Islamic Law, and especially Islamic culture -- and there are many Islamic cultures actually; the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. 
But let me repeat the words of the woman. 
Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. 
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker. 
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman. 
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews? 
How do we make it happen? 
Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. 
But I knew what he meant, because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then, basically, index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't. 
Where does it go? What's left? 
Now they have started writing their signature. 
You can't see it, but it's there." 
One of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately. 
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe. 
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way." 
(Laughter) Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area. 
(Applause) I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek. 
Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. 
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate. 
People who say, don't sit that team next to this team, because they like noise and they need quiet. 
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good. 
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment, domestic violence and so on. 
We're going to try and get all, something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node. 
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. 
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. 
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. 
All the weight of your upper torso -- your arms, your head -- goes right down through your back, your spine, into those bones when you sit. 
It's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. 
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage. 
We're also, on top of that, integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM. 
And as this assembly is towed through the water, the doors meet resistance with the ocean, and it opens the mouth of the net, and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom. 
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length. 
NASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks -- that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids. 
The second, I don't think we're that close. 
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was, when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data, some of them — not all of them — seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid. 
Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101. 
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra, latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. 
My favorite one was he was in the manhole. 
And I met them in the early '90s. 
When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell. 
And something about that environment -- and I've started calling it the "liquid network," where you have lots of different ideas that are together, different backgrounds, different interests, jostling with each other, bouncing off each other -- that environment is, in fact, the environment that leads to innovation. 
But in fact the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain. 
But I didn't say these things to Abed. 
You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work. 
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. 
I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict, during our post-conflict decade. 
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore; they had become gods. 
But there's millions of deaf people in the world, and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now. 
You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust? 
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" -- (Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet? 
Well, we could try to farm more land. 
Well, I think it's cool, but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. 
What are its kindred and component parts? 
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative. 
It was only because of our passports. 
I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment. 
This was to be the focus of the investigation. 
We need better tools. 
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us, doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California, which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis; Austin Bat Cave in Austin; Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle, this will be open in April. 
I still haven't given up my hope to see you. 
(Laughter) You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. 
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now. 
You know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees. 
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. 
I can vote you off the island. 
KA: Shocking. 
That's the thing I want you to think about them. 
You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you're an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you're Freudian, or your mother, if you're Jewish. 
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States. 
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing, or any of that kind of nothing. 
Let me give you an example of this. 
Red circle. 
All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television. 
Now the way that's done is by the following. 
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. 
"Yesterday I thought." 
This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations, the movement of these agents over into humans; and by capturing this moment, we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. 
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. 
More men who believe that the balance is best? 
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call "DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer, you should really look at this technique, and get a feeling of the face of the enemy. 
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier, we could start by saying something like, "These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium." 
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound, whereas real heparin, the real ingredient, cost 900 dollars a pound. 
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive." 
His mother died when he was only nine years old; his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later; and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22. 
But it's really necessary to do it. 
They're keeping you alive. 
So the fiscal cliff, I was told that that's too partisan a thing to say, although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking. 
I'm progressive, politically -- big surprise -- but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives. 
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind. 
He was Darwin's cousin. 
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. 
It won't cost us any more to do it the right way." 
They're all together there. They are immobile. 
Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra? 
You know, what's his metaphor for performance? 
Writing is using your imagination on paper, and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids, that writing would be using your imagination on paper, if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours. 
I just happened to get my education in a little different way. 
So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you, but I want to show you two short clips. 
And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up. 
If you add Democrats, you add Republicans, you've got the American people. 
He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that." 
I only had one night in the hospital. 
You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer, and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter) Now, businesses tend to complain about this, and their, they, I don't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it, but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy, and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this, because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you," but they use piracy as market research. 
They have low incomes. And they benefit from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food. 
And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government, protecting us. 
So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle, not an easy task, in itself. 
And again, the way in which that works as a building, for those of us who can enjoy the spaces, to live and visit there. 
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. 
You've got to just respond to the situation. 
It was about shadows. 
And -- anyone remember this workbook, "Instant Activities for Your Apple" -- free poster in each book? 
Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly. 
And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more -- that's very good, too. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
The craniomandibular system is critical to that. 
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer. 
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef. 
(Skateboard noises) It's like skinboarding. 
These devices aren't accessible to people." 
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away, which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here. 
And with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life, and as a result, you have very little animal life living in this underworld. 
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel." 
Some of our talks today, we still act like that. 
I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. 
Just doesn't make sense. 
And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity, their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them. 
We're now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well, to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. 
These are dilemmas I have every day. 
It's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels, which is a great asset because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways in most states, and actually in all cities. 
I want to leave you with just two ideas. 
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.

I'm going to be an elephant handler." 
We were in Les Houches. 
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD. 
At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back. 
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. 
We stand in elections; we vote in elections; we observe elections. 
The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine. 
This is David and Erik. 
We forget how pitiless he is. 
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too. 
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology." 
Coincidence? No, it's creepy. 
And by looking at the patterns, for example, in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test, we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage. 
(Laughter) Now, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right? 
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17. 
(Laughter) Two months later -- and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer. 
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. 
But, to get on a process of increasing income, increasing skills led to very rapid growth there. 
I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. 
(Laughter) From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face. 
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy. 
It's just too damn hard. 
One reason is the East Asian Model. 
It's silent gesture. 
(Laughter) So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. 
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang. 
And she said that it's a rather boring movie. 
We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. 
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus. 
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest? 
Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's, where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically. 
We'll look at sea level rise. 
This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment -- the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense, and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer -- bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy. 
You like to drink water. 
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second, is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. 
And you know, his son was mesmerized, because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. 
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. 
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, "Save the endangered hillbillies." 
And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. 
Most of these children will never leave the institution again.

Milo: I wonder how deep it is. 
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together. 
Now, as it happens, Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat, he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon, and he has his own favorite number. 
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well. 
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world; Hyperides found himself on trial for treason. 
This is just like video conferencing today. 
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs," and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it. 
Now, I want to emphasize that these are just examples. 
Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously.

Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride? 
My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with. 
So this is a profoundly inefficient process. 
And the answer to that is research. 
It doesn't matter to me. 
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. 
So, I like to use them. 
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us. 
And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth. 
(Laughter) But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this. 
Some games are more about warfare. 
Thank you very much. 
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough. 
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people." 
No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. 
People keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar," and they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?" 
That is the real world, and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization, we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems, but we will risk losing democracy itself, locked up in the old nation-state box, unable to address global problems democratically. 
And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago. 
You've got this demand over here that has money. 
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8. 
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small. 
And then as the videos started to come in ...

The green dye is not environmentally dangerous, but it obviously looks really rather frightening. 
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists, the poets -- are on their own and they have no power, they have no might. 
SP: I agree with the president. 
But we need to do something about this problem. 
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area. 
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. 
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune. 
I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells, and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively. 
But again, those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal, to take the data, to take the observations, of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. 
Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists. 
In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink; if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night, what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.

I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. 
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on. 
And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. 
We can look at some of the data. 
The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague, but I think interesting and important, and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society, because they will be, that will tell you something about our own possibilities, that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction. 
And using cognitive surplus, we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific, literary, artistic, political efforts. 
We know that solutions are available today. 
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do. 
There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation, I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation, a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century. 
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. 
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language, and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe": same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven," and one means "bicycle" or "iron." 
PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations? 
This is why I'm launching a new initiative. 
"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions. 
We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem. 
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films. 
He was carrying a radio. 
So here's the site. Thank you. 
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column -- and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. 
Think about what that means for a second. 
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley. 
(Laughter) That's not all. 
People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter) Actually, about 80 percent of these are small business websites getting infected. 
Well, of course, there is globalization, technology, communications, all that stuff, which we'll talk about a little bit later. 
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. 
And not enough is being done about this. 
And for me, when I think about our future, and all of those problems that seem incredibly large, the scale is impossible, the urgency is there, Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems. 
We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. 
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. 
It is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life. 
Why don't we try changing it every day?"

And he was very, very sorry. 
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months. (Laughter) People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. 
AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going. 
And the last one is T. Rex. 
That, I think, is movement. 
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant. 
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit, and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.

But they have been distracted recently. 
So I hope to see you next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for Dead Duck Day. 
You're the teacher. 
(Music) In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul. 
Our cities, I would put to you, are stockpiles of these surplus capacities. 
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display, which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night -- special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever. 
I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning to ask him who's the best poet. 
On the left, we have a woman. 
(Laughter) Empiricism is inadequate because, well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. 
"Okay, great." 
We want our stuff to work too. 
The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other, a fact we should have learned many, many times over, and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. 
They're not available in Indian villages. 
Now take this together and you end up with 2.3 million words of TEDTalks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content. 
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today. 
Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good? 
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn -- and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa. 
And that's really what I'm looking for. 
Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. 
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here. 
It might be Latin American. 
People here get very confused about what a punishment is. 
(Laughter) Here is the universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists. 
And we had the chance to explain the project. 
Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full-blown? 
Since I'm always liking to solve problems, I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction, and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. 
There's a historical marker. 
What can creatures like us know of such things? 
And we started working on it, and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. 
Because through the cloud, through crowd sourcing, through the bottom-up world that we've created, where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate, we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. 
And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic. 
This picture was taken last year. 
People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. 
We're cooking from scratch every day. 
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear. 
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds, and we didn't know how to deal with these. 
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level, they can never go back. 
And I've played thousands of shows. 
And people are, in fact, imprisoned within their own bodies, but they do have a mind. 
So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16. 
The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design, they actually mean style. 
Let's take a look. 
And everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis. 
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker. 
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University? 
And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation. 
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease. 
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field? 
In the next mode, we can get Rezero to follow a person. 
It's protecting five World Heritage sites. 
And they're not just going to die of measles. 
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic. 
If you put one drop, one drop of something, in that water, it'll change it forever. 
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space, and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications. 
This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it. 
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council, and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. 
I took here a model from robotics -- it's called the Subsumption Architecture. 
But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here. 
LG: Six -- six with the thumb. 
It was started by Erik Winfree, and what it does, it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. 
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture. 
He loved to win. 
You can see it in their faces. 
And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water. 
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. 
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should. 
I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. 
And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. 
There was amazing improvements. 
It's made of paper and paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth, and the wine wicks all over everything. 
You're not totally in control, but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. 
Thank you very much. 
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit. 
(Laughter) Now astrology -- we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted; that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man who's wearing a hat.

This is a picture of Denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. 
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero. 
"Sure." 
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir-fried with pimentos. 
And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it. 
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation. 
Just take Azerbaijan.

(Laughter) RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard, so much for letting us tell the story. 
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes, we had to take this book apart. 
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better, because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution. 
And I went there -- I noticed that there was a male section, which was carefully separated from the female section. 
It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.

We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability. 
Then we looked at the question of the affordability. 
And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle. 
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts. 
"The Eldorado of the United States of America: the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California." 
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music. 
DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. 
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man. 
Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally. 
It's actually running at real rate right now, one second per second, and in fact, Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it's 38,000 miles per hour. 
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. 
The more speech you have, the better sounding voice you're going to have. 
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.

So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables and say, "That's all we have." 
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause) And so what a lot of people don't realize is, the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small. 
For example, these two show great growth in income, absolutely flat happiness curves. 
That would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. 
But I want more. 
And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer, but I'm saying that's not really the problem; that's the symptom of the problem. 
It's great to see. 
Basically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. 
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something. 
And I want you to hear that right now.

And with these pictures, I hope that we can create information, a system of information. 
People are dancing, shouting and drinking. 
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal. 
However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this. 
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. 
Their involvement reduces the cost. 
Then in 2002, when this was all going full-swing, a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.

Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival, and high rates of suicide are recorded. 
This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. 
(Laughter) So, why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from? 
And you also see this yellow activity, which represents regions where contrast is decreasing; it's going from light to dark. 
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system. 
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror. 
I'll lay around; she'll make a living. 
(Applause) So I'm a doctor, but I kind of slipped sideways into research, and now I'm an epidemiologist. 
And I -- oh, gosh. 
You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. 
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years, on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable, wonderful and fragile. 
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies. 
I'd hoped for something simpler: to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way. 
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. 
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA. 
And most people knock them down when they're small. 
And this is what they unloaded for me: I had four yak loads of medical supplies, which are dumped in a tent, and here I am trying to arrange things. 
(Laughter) It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward. 
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. 
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. 
Within two weeks, I had 150 people wanting to join in. 
There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. 
You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers, the beauty of the symmetry. 
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? 
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick. 
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. 
You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting. 
Not only can you say how many notes, it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are. 
This map was made for military reasons. 
It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. 
What happens when you combine these technologies together: increasing availability of facial data; improving facial recognizing ability by computers; but also cloud computing, which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies; and ubiquitous computing, which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer, to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds? 
No violence, no bombs, no guns. 
AM: I don't know. I don't think so. 
As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down, but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is, and then combine those in a real Bayesian way. 
(Laughter) That force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that. 
Now, what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. 
Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead, allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland. 
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies. 
In that moment, our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal, but if we're doing our job right, and you've checked the jargon at the front door, trust your instinct. 
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers. 
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- "God, please cure him. 
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me. 
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States, and they would form companies. 
Use your own eyes and be smart, read your meter, and if you're anything like me, it'll change your life. 
It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. 
It was published in the literature. 
It's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. 
Now you say, really? 
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it. 
It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them. 
There is more to the story. 
You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. 
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self. 
Then it's: "always works out." 
You never know when they're going to attack next, who or what the consequences will be. 
That's great! I love red wine! 
I've been wondering for a long time, since I've been thinking about memes a lot, is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other, the gestures we copy, the human things -- and all these technological things around us? 
Because I have to know how people react to things. 
And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. 
Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees. 
And this is air temperature. 
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see. 
It's that we expect them to bring us happiness. 
He makes us the subject of his art. 
And so it came to me in waves. 
And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects, you haven't opened your eyes enough. 
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing. 
I put him here to remind us, I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable, competent militaries who can create real military effect. 
Several years ago, there was one African girl. 
It really is a little bit out of place temporally. 
And I want to share a couple stories with you today. 
But oh, her soap! 
With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. 
The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know, where the idea was, I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. 
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money, too much need -- and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work. 
The more targeted our interventions, the better. 
And I have to tell you, as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines, I find this strangely beautiful. 
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. 
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. 
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets. 
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. 
And complete silence fell. 
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room. 
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. 
And this is her getting the world record in real time. 
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins. 
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville. 
I felt, when I had my photographs, that I was holding on to something true, regardless of agendas or politics. 
This would imply a massive leap in migration. 
So the first idea I had, initially, was just to go the federal and state governments and go, "Here, take it, for free." 
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. 
So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA. 
Well, I think number one is curiosity. 
As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas, I learned that you could create your own world. 
Cluster bombs left behind. 
People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter in a matter of days on several occasions. 
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. 
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus. 
So is London a scaled up Birmingham, which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.? 
Anyway, I'm out of time. 
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet, to an area that I thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor. 
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure. 
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. 
But there was this limiting factor, the issue of the code, and how to make the cells respond better, produce normal responses, and so this was our contribution. 
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company, I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound. 
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar. 
But to make it more interesting, I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan, which is a hazy moon of Saturn. 
Here's an example of a project using the microphone. 
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face. 
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. 
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there. 
Now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves. 
There are only four periods in the last 500 years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution." 
I went and got golf balls from golf courses. 
And we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years. 
And all these works, in some way, talk about luck or fate or chance. 
By the age of 24, I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt, being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments, being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience. 
Right? (Applause) And so, step number two, we knew we needed to change the laws. 
And everybody knows that these three animals are related. 
It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. 
He didn't call it the hypotenuse, he called it the shortcut distance." 
That's not my slides, but it's okay. 
I took the test and the result showed I was positive. 
So for 11 years, I conformed. 
Is it luck? Is it chance? 
So in surgery, it's important to know what to cut out. 
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? 
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. 
It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space, and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. 
If you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks, you may have heard of a kind of crisis between China and the U.S. 
That is changing our business. 
The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south. 
And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another. 
That's why its other name is Doubletaker, Taker of Doubles. 
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting. 
And also, what one of the speciality we are doing, my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity, and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon. 
But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases. 
So there's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. 
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries. 
We didn't really realize that until 1914, when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati zoo. 
Beyond warming, we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so, and already affecting animals. 
Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. 
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades, and we're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain. 
we understand that it's expensive here: about 30,000 dollars. 
After 9/11, the tables were turned. 
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture. 
Diver 2 (Video): Hoo! 
So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see. 
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. 
She was offered a hysterectomy, but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option. 
It is objectless. There are no things in it. 
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet. 
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said, "Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. 
And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started -- I first went to them and said, "You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient." 
These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere. 
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made. 
Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect. 
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. 
They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius, 50 miles per gallon." 
And these are the references that we have in any city. 
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types. 
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized, I think. 
A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time, probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams, like they're trying to get in education systems. 
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. 
And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions, then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care. 
Thanks. 
But look at her face there, as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror. 
So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. 
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on, they can dive to about 90 meters and they can stay down for about 4.6 minutes. 
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in. 
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated? 
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. 
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying. 
He's been in many battles. 
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte. 
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. 
Thank you. 
And you can do that one year in a row, you may be able to do it two years in a row. 
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time. 
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here, these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. 
Yeah. 
You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid. 
They weren't quite slick enough. 
Did you notice something? 
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that? 
I witnessed this firsthand. 
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes." 
And if you think about using this in testing, in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training, you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. 
And with the kind of computing power we have now, there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money. 
But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out. 
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments, but they tend to then break apart. 
It's called thought-controlled computing. 
You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. 
The Iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal, so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. 
And indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine? 
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. 
Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single, solo inventor who, working late in the lab one night, makes an earthshaking discovery, and voila, overnight everything's changed. 
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile. 
It is really a sacred space. 
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with, you had a weakened immune system, you lived in poverty in India or Africa, your likelihood of dying was far greater. 
(Music) (Applause) This is me building a prototype for six hours straight. 
These radio waves penetrate through walls. 
And -- so the way I saw this in my mind at first, was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed, and the pieces would move far out, and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel, to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. 
Hmmm ... 
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport, but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event, the New York City Marathon. 
It might change my behavior. 
I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do, but quickly learned, not only did she not like it, but she wasn't really good at it. 
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow, scripted by strangers who were there for him when. 
And they turned around, headed back to the coast, and all five of them died on the return journey. 
The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. 
Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us. 
You know, I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. 
As a little boy, and through my teenage years, I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. 
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power, and most likely a majority, and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years. 
The one up there can't divide at all. 
At five minutes to six in the afternoon, we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam, the duck comes out of the museum, and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. 
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. 
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven't told you that he's the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which Mary does not need to worry about. 
It's very painstaking work, but the best things come in small packages. 
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. 
More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see these communities start, hesitatingly, to come together. 
I get asked all of the time from people, "Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?" 
This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world. 
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. 
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices: you either fight back and engage or you could take off. 
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter. 
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. 
I think it's a great challenge. 
There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. 
Well, it's certainly not this one. 
(Laughter) But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. 
Now -- (Laughter) -- So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors, so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields, such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on. 
And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were 50 cents each. 
The economy needs them. 
I suspect the latter. 
Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. 
Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra? 
(Laughter) But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight, seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you. 
The girls just shook their heads, put them in their hands, and let me go my own way. 
DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. 
When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country, crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella, nobody's speaking about corruption. 
We have almost 14 million roots. 
Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education. 
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's, and I put the fish in. 
We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone. 
Thanks very much. 
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer. 
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life. 
Let's go back to my first example of the Chinese. 
The most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age. 
A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. 
Don't you have color in France?" 
(Laughter) What I'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry, that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys, when kids could come home and play with them, then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. 
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right? 
To what extent are these people right? 
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her. 
Think about meaningful places. 
After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills. 
All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house, from ground level, making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. 
Luckily, in the last two or three decades, digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we've brought to bear in the digital preservation, in our digital preservation war. 
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting. 
But a couple of days later, we thought about it with my students, and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition? 
Think about everything it has brought us. 
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly? 
Just to give you one example: Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue. 
But the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible. 
This one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence. 
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art, practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects, contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. 
And it's revving up to the very end, and then at the very end you've got to -- boom! -- knock them out of the park. 
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world, because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. 
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring. 
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit. 
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth, that I had challenged my students in America -- I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots." 
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. 
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city, and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away. 
So every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country. 
Think about this: this attack is generic. 
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way, whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day, as so on. 
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
I didn't know the protocols. 
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed. 
They were just wound up doing these things all day long, until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say, "Okay, everybody freeze." 
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. 
He screeched that he would block the financing. 
It's a magical realist novel. 
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle. 
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. 
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful. 
That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls. 
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer, being in a car accident. 
That's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products. 
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources, and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour -- anybody here fast in math? 
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. 
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself, speeding up aging. 
Just like it wasn't TV and only better. 
Two things: One, I never had sex. 
What the hell does that mean? 
They are not meant to stay. 
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly. 
They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations. 
15 years from the robust mouse. 
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. 
For those from the developing world, there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea. 
What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have? 
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich." 
Not for the lowest people on the totem pole, but for the folks who were all the way around the chain, the entire team including the surgeons. 
Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain. 
I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. 
Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both. 
So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. 
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura, and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be? 
But just as quickly as they explode, more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer, so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. 
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along, and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line. 
I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer. 
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do. 
So what we're doing at the moment like calcium, potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine. 
And could we even define a planetary boundary, a fence, within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity? 
One was absolute terror -- it's like, "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up. 
You know, bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. 
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. 
I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid, if I could only breathe underwater. 
Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code, which are computer programs, that allow these creatures to grow over time. 
It's just an intellectual property setup. 
Yet he too had to face death, and he wrote these words: "even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me." 
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. 
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was. 
And so I happened to have a snake pin. 
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. 
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times. 
That's not going to be changed at all. 
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything." 
And when it comes to architecture in cities, that really matters. 
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. 
You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground, with the veterinarian, but a person can ride him. 
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment, it doesn't matter. 
And he was a clever man. He sort of said, "Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs." 
And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken, I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I'd be godfather, which I became. 
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there's something worth explaining. 
But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators; you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe. 
And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them. 
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is, that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power, then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. 
This is what he saw. 
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. 
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament. 
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you. 
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements, if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible. 
That's bad news for us too. 
Because it is actually a long-term play. 
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable: three teams tagged 1,700 tunas, bluefin, yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas, put in the tags that actually have the sensors, stick out the tuna and then let them go. 
I just hope she likes video games. 
Go home to your husband -- what does he need? 
(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing? Everything. 
Now, at this phase, the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are. 
Teacher: And then, have you got it again? 
Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold, wading in water poisoned by mercury. 
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean, but nothing with perfume. 
Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farm in, like, North Carolina, and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay. 
So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. 
Look at it here: 39 digits long, proven to be prime in 1876 by a mathematician called Lucas. 
All other primates, when they're scared, they run up a tree, where they feel safe. 
Then I just pick things up. 
By 2015, there will be three billion smartphones in the world. 
You could, if you're really smart, you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it, and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size. 
But now with the Web, we leave a trail. 
(Laughter) Better really hurry up. 
This is what Roth has found out. 
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices. 
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ... 
Not magically. 
And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future. 
It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book. 
Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. 
Typically, these things are put in the ground. 
And so these characters would become my friends. 
That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide. 
And his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life." 
And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations, and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it, as Feynman said, you know, we need to build something to understand it. 
And I did one that was about 35 feet long. 
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. 
So obviously we didn't have any money. 
Because this is, in some sense, the first way, that people discover their own potential as actors, and discover their own agency. 
I'll discuss two very promising approaches. 
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. 
But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog. 
Then static electricity set in. 
This was kind of the defining slogan. 
Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else." 
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light -- electric light, which in turn creates more heat, which creates more cooling loads and so on. 
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk -- and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there. 
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened. 
Men drown at twice the rate of women, because men think they can swim across that lake. 
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life. 
Wish I could build my muscle this fast. 
So, wonderful things and grim things. 
And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like, and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters, to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not, at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science. 
We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments, like this building here -- environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering, heating and air conditioning. 
And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is, "But car seats are so expensive and complicated, and they have this big tangle of latches, how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated?" 
There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them. 
Fortunately, we have some examples. 
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on. 
At first, the results were predictable. 
They become lovely monsters. 
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board. 
I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. 
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time, we can actually test that. And so it seems to be -- fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case that these things are positively related. 
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation. 
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." 
For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. 
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. 
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris, trying to explain his theory. 
And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity. 
Let's start at the beginning. 
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock. 
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies. 
And I call it "hometown security." 
You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids. 
And she wrote a little note, she said, "Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world." 
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom. 
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. 
And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. 
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design. 
So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents, and a lot of children had been born with HIV. 
And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards, then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. 
I'm curious about how things work and how they are made, but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world, and right now, we don't know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of. 
So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner, which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. 
For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? 
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field. 
Cognitively, they can understand artificially-created languages. 
I wish you would help them. 
when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster. 
And that is really very simple, to make our patients better. 
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems. 
We spend lots of time learning about calculation, but let's not forget about application, including, perhaps, the most important application of all, learning how to think. 
Add nine to that, we get 15. 
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. 
Thank you. 
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. 
(Applause) So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment; it's design. 
It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. 
Someone came up to them and said, "You're the chosen one. 
It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. 
We're also looking at survival of the fittest, not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground, but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. 
And here's some music translated into color. 
In the past several days, I heard people talking about China. 
Let's pretend there's a pandemic. 
And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see. 
And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes, and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?" 
In a world with no systems, with chaos, everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. 
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. 
Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly. 
Right, do you know where I'm going? 
And they just kind of come up, kind of like this. 
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. 
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. 
And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. 
(Applause) I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers you hope you're not going to meet at TED. 
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform, we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. 
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse." 
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction. 
Let's everybody run around and play your role. 
And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us -- you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? 
And so for me, it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context, as though you were an astronaut, and see these two things as an object, because they are so intimately bound, and one is meaningless without the other. 
So what I did hear, once in a while, was that people wanted a loan -- I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. 
I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off. 
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in 1847, a whole new era of surgery was ushered in. 
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer. 
We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all, and if we did look at the data, we'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low," because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower, giving us even stronger statistical results than we could. 
So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this. 
There is a basic view that real value involves making things, involves labor. It involves engineering. 
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old. 
(Laughter) That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student, professor now at Lewis and Clark, literally giving his first-born child up for this test. 
And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything, whether it's war or terrorism, is abolition of nuclear weapons. 
And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork. 
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. 
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one, and the absence of current to represent a zero. 
So the price of a base, to sequence a base, has fallen 100 million times. 
No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left, and says "Heathrow Express." 
But -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems. 
And even with this high prevalence, women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time. 
Find an artist or a writer -- or, heaven forbid, find a philosopher and talk to them. 
And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes. (Laughter) And so, we made this game, and she got it. 
Their works for me are about, not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine, that their visions create and put out there in the world, but more, perhaps, importantly, through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation, as well as in the future. 
Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject. 
And in the second flight, three minutes of fully-controlled, aerodynamic flight at Mach 20. 
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why." 
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light. 
We need to educate the kids. 
The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species, the unconscious mind does most of the work. 
And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. 
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object. 
On the next table was a Chinese guy, and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos. 
Let me first address a few popular misconceptions. 
The arts, whatever they do, whenever they call us together, invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. 
Too many questions are left unanswered. 
It's a tiny, little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles. 
Without the Sun, there's likely to be no life on this planet. 
She doesn't know she's being filmed. 
Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did. 
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. 
But that's all about energy and industry. 
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because its body temperature is actually relatively low. 
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth. 
They can make some educated guesses. 
And these columns, they have information at very many scales. 
When Jerry Brown was elected, this was the challenge that was put to him. 
We have this non-zero-sum relationship, and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you're more likely to cut them a break. 
This is equally tragic. 
Toothbrush, cool. 
The idea of this air genie is, it's something that can just transform and become anything. 
Here we go. 
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story. 
I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. 
(Laughter) And it’s all a question of perspective. 
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. 
She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it." 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. 
I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being, since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins. 
The OED defines spectrum as "The entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part." 
What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life, whether it's your work life or your business life? 
And, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones. 
So here's how things play out. 
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny, and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless. 
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. 
The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual -- and whatever else we devote ourselves to. 
And I think just the opposite is true. 
We have A.C. and D.C., get 12 volts D.C., so that could be used for certain applications. 
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform, that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different, perhaps something radically different. 
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. 
Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:" Juliet is the sun. 
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda, and so what they also do is the total bypass: just fund NGOs. 
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill. 
He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service, to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. 
One grows up to become a computer scientist, one grows up to join the Navy, one grows up to become an engineer, and then there's me: the comic book artist. 
Dopamine system, the wanting system, is much more centralized. 
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect. 
And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. 
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize. 
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light -- the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power. 
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other. 
they say, "Go away." 
And so, as I have been thinking about this, I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today? 
And I should say, I think this is a rather modest prediction. 
My office was just a few blocks away. 
While I was absent from Iran, the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture. 
So for the subway in New York, I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading. 
When the BP oil spill happened, I was working at MIT, and I was in charge of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology. 
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl." 
You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks. 
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary. 
I bet a lot of you do, right? 
Humans think about our own health in a prospective way. 
And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible, that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society, and you can have growth. 
The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling. 
And so I'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. 
We have to have a modern concept, which fits to the data. 
This evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us. 
We have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body. 
So that was the basis of it, was one-on-one attention. 
(Laughter) There are thousands of books on that. 
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan, and how simply could I state something. 
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. 
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes. 
Exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding, is mind-blowing. 
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. 
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine. 
It took a month to make this part. 
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection. 
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together. 
But it isn't. 
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into, A, trying to come up with alternative fuels and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels, in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point. 
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn't enough for me. 
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy. 
If you pay 100,000 dollars, you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse, awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you. 
So that's the next layer of simplicity, and, in fact, integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they, in general, work really well. 
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist. 
And it worked out that way. 
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. 
The average player spends something like six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it. 
So this was the best job he could get. 
And I started looking at how we could build battery back-up systems that could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day, or three days' worth of back-up power. 
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty, swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes. 
This photograph is very important because it's much later. 
A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it. 
What you just did, that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power. 
Again, the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. 
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives. 
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful, obviously. 
So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows. 
So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said, "It's a little crazy, but logical. 
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won. 
But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. 
They said, yes, walking the course is strenuous physical exercise. 
I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture, and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. 
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally, but in a quasi-metaphorical way. 
And I know it sounds crazy. 
But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. 
They started with VHS. 
It was a long film to work on. (Laughter) Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because the movie itself is about film illusions. 
What does that mean? 
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. 
Now, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact, this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. 
This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs, but never by these other signs at the bottom. 
So it's a very good theory, but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons. 
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations. 
I really got close to design again. 
My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way. 
Well, I think that's it. 
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. 
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. 
The penguin swims toward me, takes off. 
I'm also slightly in awe of them. 
But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built, and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now. 
(Laughter) Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better. 
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased. 
This is a horrific image, so I'm putting my hand up now. 
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. 
So the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001, 2002. 
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world? 
There's silence. 
Thank you very much. 
So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia. 
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. 
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. 
I come out, and there's Esther. 
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average. 
So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter, and not to have objects falling on the rails. 
(Laughter) I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. 
And the number we end up with -- that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 -- is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. 
But we got this other benefit, and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside. 
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable. 
Because we live on a water planet. 
And we have not thought enough about the solutions. 
We talk without lying. 
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies. 
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. 
You want to do. 
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people, endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people, putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others, and this is because of human ego, human greed. 
Juveniles: a huge load. 
(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. 
They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly. 
That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. 
He is on the way down. 
And I also have to build their faith. 
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great. 
Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse. 
In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. 
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting. 
People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. 
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren. 
So these guys, you see them. 
They stay because you want to stay in your home. 
The patient's not delusional. 
You can, once you have all of those different points, you can make it easy for investors. 
I knew Craig and respected him. 
So this was the birth of vampire economics. 
And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan. 
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick. 
And now, today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years, from that wall. 
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design. 
But there's a big difference, which is that it only happens within the colony. 
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that. 
And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. 
And in the right-hand corner, you don't have to calculate anything. 
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. 
And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. 
She's turning it inside out. 
He was a limited man who'd found it within himself to be kind to me. 
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too. 
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness. 
Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough, there's an entire open-source, third-party, independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make, in fact, movies out of Lego, 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube, and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things. 
Thank you. 
Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. 
What's its future? 
I remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed, whether in the hospital or at home, I remember my sense of failure -- the feeling of I don't know what I have to say; I don't know what I can say; I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 
And I was distraught. 
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success, what has come to be known as GNH, or gross national happiness. 
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May, and was sure that I was coming home with the gold. 
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. 
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim. 
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites; I figured, no problem. 
(Laughter) The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European. 
And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way. 
Fast forward four years later, after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country, and — ("No more bathing!") — I can't say any more than that. (Laughter) I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath-substituting lotion. 
(Applause) Sustainability represents the what, the where and the how of what is caught. 
You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. 
Most people say they would. 
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old families in a refugee camps. 
It has 20 different neuron types. 
You are witnessing change in history. 
What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well, France is a liberal society." 
Well, our research -- my generation for sure, people who were going to school in the late '60s -- made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture, looking at architecture within its own territory, and we were much more affected by film, by what was going on in the art world, etc. 
So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people, not only the current generation, but the future generations. 
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe. 
And it's the fastest thing on European waters. 
Sorry, this is a global story. 
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan. 
For the first time, an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale, showing where the sharks go. 
Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. 
We carry that in us. 
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity. 
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information. 
The first offshore wells were called whales. 
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars, but from the opposite side? 
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born -- we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby, ensuring that they live healthy, successful lives. 
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting. 
Why is it that women are, on the one hand, viciously oppressed by cultural practices, and yet at the same time, are the preservers of cultures in most societies? 
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things. 
It's the following. 
From there I started with skydiving. 
Most of you look smart. 
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells. 
Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves. 
This has led, in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial, to a test of that very compound. 
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well. 
(Laughter) They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92. 
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature. 
They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not. 
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again. 
Is it worth their while? 
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans. 
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins. 
And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up, only emit light at very specific colors, was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory, the theory of the structure of atoms. 
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test. 
After, there is the narcissistic design: it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter) After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist, and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way, and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result, for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it. 
It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand, and then communication is limited. 
That's a cool name. I will say that. 
Oh, we get lots of them, hundreds of them every year come by. 
BR: And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear, we really have something that looks, tastes and behaves like the real thing. 
I was in India, and I was walking down the streets, and I saw a billboard painter. 
And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City, built out six bus rapid transit lines, 57 miles of new speedy bus lanes. 
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue. 
We see the result, the traces, if you like, of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments. 
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth, showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide, as a clear signal of life, and oxygen and ozone. 
(Applause). 
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. 
Yes, yes, OK. 
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin. 
But I'm -- in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age. 
(Laughter) This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four here. 
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. 
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world, and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion. 
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. 
It startled, then bored, then repelled me. 
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. 
And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose between 75 and less than 200, checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor -- you'll see how that can impact diabetes. 
I just like, throw it in. 
If you don't bribe the officer, then you will get a traffic ticket -- or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse -- whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest. 
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough. 
And, indeed, there is a better way. 
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders. 
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. 
Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha, with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. 
I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is. 
You think they can't possibly exist. 
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. 
Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere, the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed, the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor -- the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs, the cancer of stress for not achieving enough, the cancer of buried trauma, the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish, the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped, the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. 
What's important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing, every word that they ever said, every utterance disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone. 
I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. 
But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion, showing how they'll be used. 
They are just incredibly expensive. 
And I thought that was the norm, because I had never seen fish like this. 
Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia, describes that when she went to Congress, she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green." 
In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem. 
I'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal, I'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very, very sick indeed, here shown in fast motion, and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos, very dead mosquitos, and I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen, we have swapped the cards with mosquitos. 
There are two basic types of innovation. 
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. 
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy. 
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves. 
And the answer to it, I think, can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, where there's a tribe, a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians. 
Close encounter four: the Algarve, Portugal, 1991. 
You think of yourself as the servant. 
I felt so sick. 
When she had recurring symptoms she went back to her doctor. 
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes. 
So we have an opportunity to really open up education. 
But when it's something other than water, and their water habitat changes, they don't have many options. 
A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program. 
Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this! 
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors, is going to make the time. 
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. 
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease, and they sterilized the donor ileum. 
Daniel Kahneman: Sure. 
The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. 
The first thing is that the big myth, number one, is that in fact it's not really a crime. 
And because your brain starter motor began there, now it's got to deal with it. 
"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio? 
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. 
We have a problem of perception. 
Who has a Blackberry? 
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it. 
But slowly the game moved on, you know, finally. 
And I've come here to ask you today: what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment, which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world, and most importantly, in a sustainable world? 
We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says, "Love thine enemy." 
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future. 
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. 
Raise your hands. 
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape -- name isn't all that important. 
OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is, I'm going to give you a little clue. 
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive, but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. 
What do you want me to do with it? 
And we did. 
We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, wireless and, I would say, mobile now -- this era of digital medicine. 
Because this is what you will take away from here, a reconnection with nature, I hope. 
On the ground, it's powered electrically. 
The way we tend to use resources is we extract them, we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them. 
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums, and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. 
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much." 
It gets it right 99 percent of the time. 
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules, that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz. 
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. 
One might think reading these books -- and I've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this -- that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books, my early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity. 
And then, the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles. 
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged. 
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc, okay? 
Now I see some puzzled looks like, "Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do? 
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony, along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world. 
In fact, what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history. 
[The Himalayas.] (Music) The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite: unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste. 
After 10 years of experiments, I found it. 
If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags, it helps to understand what makes them do it. 
(Laughter) We do it again. 
It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain. 
There are some people who are very good at this. 
Clean out the air ducts in your home, in your workplace, in your school. 
Now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin. 
(Laughter) Written out as a book, this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again. 
Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫ Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea. 
You can ask about what causes it biochemically: neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff. 
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it. 
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it. 
I can ask her what to read. 
When schools stop doing that all the time, I will admit that, yes, it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. 
There are many people on this stage right now. 
"The world will not be saved by the Internet." 
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. 
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant, what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission. 
But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, "But what about corruption? 
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework. 
It's around about 770 grams of carbon. 
If you've got two of something, you add two more, you get four. 
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth, and people would ask me, why. 
(Applause) I like it. (Applause) (Laughter) DL: Oh yeah, okay, in my family we had seven girls, four boys, we had two fiddles and one piano, and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments, so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone off the instrument. You had to wait until they were finished, so of course, what we would do is we'd get on the piano and you wouldn't even get off to eat, because you wouldn't want to give it up to your brother or sister, and they'd wait and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight 
So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size. 
And the problem is that, up until now, it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools. 
Now that might be the end of the story -- Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that. 
In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy. 
This is not the common man. 
Well it turns out, we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks. 
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. 
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory, Tesla created his inventions in his mind. 
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house. 
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures. 
So you don't want to optimize for efficiency, you want to optimize for power per dollar. 
(Laughter) And that too is a relatively new idea. 
So after looking at these three, and 47 others, we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use. 
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points. 
So that today, the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. 
And in the following months and years, I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language. 
The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. 
So that when you walk in or you come in from home, if you carry a purse, it works in your purse. 
KB: James and our country director in Ghana, Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people, from the fishing industry, for enslaving children. 
This is my passport from 2004. 
If you find out -- now I understand. 
And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating. 
So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism. 
But the balances redressed, our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance. 
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity. 
I say, "Keep him alive if you can." 
You see? But the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too. 
They've now created an organic robot. 
And one day, my father actually took me into the bush. 
And I'll explain. 
Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth, there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past. 
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk, we could know, before they even have symptoms, that they're having a heart attack, to save their life. 
And I've summarized those things, for me personally, as three As. 
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday, because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. 
Thank you for that. 
(Laughter) So, does it work? Yes, it works -- to a certain point. 
Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing? 
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time. 
And thirdly, we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds. And again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain itself. 
You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere, and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see? 
(Laughter) Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. 
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?" 
(Laughter) That is, there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. 
We know what they are. 
And they're going to be playing this clip: "I'm such a good mother." 
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. 
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand. 
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving. 
And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists, about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to, who was a neuroscientist, said, "You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up," and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem. 
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. 
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it, "Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist. 
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. 
Why do we want to do that? 
And it was a big Christmas hit. 
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good. 
Not many people like checking boxes. 
And the land, to depths of tens of meters, is also warming. 
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate. 
I'll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. 
We have just to finish the story. 
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying, for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information, or we say, you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force, you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say, "Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment," or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well, our economic growth's okay, thank you very much, considerably better than yours, so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights." 
Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids, and the teachers out in the Midwest, and the other parts of the country, when you get away from these tech areas, they don't know what to do with these kids. 
That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together, and at the same time how these small objects, like the Walkman first and then the iPod, create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. 
They're not going to export your uncle's Buick. 
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed during the semesters. 
Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras? 
RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions: you must not talk about your own business, and this, and now you ask me. 
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat. 
It seemed to open up new perspectives, and therein lay the paradigm shift. 
This is a photograph several years later, when Bragg had cause to smile. 
I graduated. I decided to get married. 
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk. 
And toward the end, he said, "If you would know the pine tree, go to the pine tree." 
That's what you get furious about right? 
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously. 
This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people. 
So we began this journey, and we launched it in 1999. 
You can do something about that too. 
The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA, which is where we have one these scanning centers, and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous. 
After 75 minutes — (Laughter) — I had seen enough, and I got hungry, and I wanted to go home. 
But he doesn't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own. 
Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. 
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment, public health, and food security at risk. 
And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned. 
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. 
It wasn't really what people needed. 
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there? 
So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology. 
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation, but I think he concentrated on the wrong things. 
Oh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here. 
As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. 
What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis? 
So, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. 
(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there. 
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy, it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. 
So the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon. 
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. 
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year. 
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer, but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service. 
Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!) And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared. 
For Ms. Dewey, this isn't why she became a teacher. 
Now there are things that we can do in the future. 
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks. 
We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives? 
There is something very restorative about nature, and it's part of how we are tuned. 
And I thought a lot about, What was my daughter's life going to be like without me? 
But it is a politics of principle, not of partisanship. 
So, this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. 
It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means, because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. 
I'll give you an idea. 
These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means. 
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors. 
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step. 
Lastly I want to say that all of you, probably, have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet, and you recognized that those are individuals. 
(Laughter) So, they really are pretty amazing creatures. 
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration. 
People would name the robots. 
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it. 
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah. 
So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species, the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination, and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology. 
Thank you. (Applause) So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. 
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of. 
Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before. 
And thank you very much. 
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story. 
India, the world champions. 
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. 
I was talking to mother and father this morning, and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say, but you have to talk about your work with children." 
First thing is that the global nuclear weapons, in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps, happen to be not uniformly secure. 
I just want to get that out of the way.

So, if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case, in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism. 
Originally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village. 
And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it, and we would -- we were just amazed. 
It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases, it's hard to get well, you might die, but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.

We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill, but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings, living people. 
As Hans Rosling, the master, my master, said, "Let the dataset change your mindset." 
But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success -- Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. 
So the next question is about partiality. 
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map. 
So there are many other details like this.

This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. 
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done -- it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.

One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. 
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild. 
(Applause) So, OK, so why? 
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. 
We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do. 
It's not really a conscious decision, "I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this." 
You have stop signals -- we have up to eight stop signals. 
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. 
Here's what happened to this company. 
(Applause) Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball," or have read the book by Michael Lewis, will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane. 
Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV, cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year. 
This one's a little bit more sophisticated, and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices. 
(Laughter) This is for her: I love being a girl. 
(Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. 
The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have, it's how you use the bombs you have, and more importantly, whether you ought to use bombs at all. 
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon, and it was just after -- actually, to be honest, too long after -- we had moved into a new house. 
(Applause) So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation, what would you say? 
And so what does that mean? 
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms. 
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily. 
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears. 
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions, tweak our technologies to make ourselves better. 
or these good bugs that we are talking about, for a long, long time. 
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact. 
Most of the time it looked like this. 
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. 
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. 
My girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it. 
(Laughter) So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. 
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. 
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" 
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information? 
And he signs off, "Thank you." 
Pretty simple -- it's huge business. 
So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out. 
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today. 
They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce. 
The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece, in their labs. 
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions, but when we study superstring theory, we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form. 
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done. 
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that." 
That explained everything. 
we're going to kick their ass, which is why people don't try to do that any more. 
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right? 
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath, they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. 
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right? 
Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue, the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about. 
It really changed my life totally. 
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated, that we've already agreed upon. 
So again, we begin with DNA. 
It was also an expensive fight. 
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese." 
Success is in the doing, and failures are celebrated and analyzed. 
I had just taken trigonometry in high school, I learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus. 
We're now right into the 1960s. 
The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be. 
(Music) Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey. 
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism, the way my uncle likes it. 
Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time. 
And we also use three laser range finders. 
And when I present this in Africa -- Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question. 
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs? 
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly. 
I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing." 
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down. 
I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. 
Could you go the other way? 
You do find groups in the animal kingdom -- you do find cooperative groups -- but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now, and they're kind of a bit more dramatic. 
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. 
It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it. 
But Sakena defies labels. 
If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe. 
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. 
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique, and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT. 
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you? 
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy, universe or multiverse?" 
Instead of thinking about what to build, building in order to think. 
Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this. 
What do people want in their TV then? 
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people. 
(Laughter) Which -- which he did, which he did. 
But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage. 
The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment. 
TD: So, with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference, I really feel that the development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings, but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle TD: Of course, I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India, the great country of India, but at the same time, I think, as some of us have acknowledged, we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground 
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful." 
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz" to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. 
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again. 
And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric, reasons to be cheerful. 
If we're talking about the 21st-century city, these are the guys who are going to be making it. 
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time. 
But I wanted to share with you three areas that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the Wired article. 
But I think the final note really is that we can do it. 
In fact, in the last 10 years, the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled, while in the same time, the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. 
It's a civil war. 
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented. 
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source, and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population. 
Why don't they affect me? 
This goes on for another four stops. 
And also you want something that frees your eyes. 
The other thing is, you know, it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood. 
No machines have been developed. 
That's what plants actually do for a living. 
Anyway. 
I'm also making a decompiculture kit, a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation. 
There's a lot of other ways you can die. 
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature. 
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that? 
So the question is: What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed? 
One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400. 
And it's a fantastic opportunity in science to see and experience basking sharks, and they are awesome creatures. 
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter." 
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets. 
It's the ideas. 
So, for example, here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university. 
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights. 
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power, and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc. 
If you look closely, you'll notice a series of what are Russian telephone numbers. 
We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization. 
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions. 
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. 
What my language would have forced me to do, instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle," is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information. 
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. 
I'll go along with that too. 
So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt. 
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it. 
People ask the wrong question, and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer, for that reason, if not for others. 
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture. 
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. 
What are we going to do with all this research, besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears? 
It's that broken experience on the Web. 
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready." 
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. 
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well, such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type, we know that this is probably what's causing this disease. 
The first, if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision. 
But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general GPS reliability, there's something even more potent and more subversive than a Wave Bubble, and that is a GPS spoofer. 
Good news: Chariot's coming. 
Right after September 11th, last year, I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it, the way that we excise it from our bodies. 
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand." 
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in. 
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively, hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do, or who we're going to need to be. 
The original intention of this space, which was unfortunately never realized, was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. 
And if you want an example of perseverance, grit and strength in a beautiful, little package, it is her. 
So it occurred to me, what happens if we could run these backwards? 
And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A1 sauce. 
So, as we have faced liability, we have stepped back and back, and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is: power. 
And a few people got excited about it. 
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption, like the European Union, Japan and of course, the United States. 
And science is important in informing decision makers, and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in. 
In the side effect profile, etc., you want to see where those genes are turned on. 
(Laughter) So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work? 
(Applause) My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago. 
And it might make you think, perhaps there's an issue to do with areas, and in this talk, I'd like to talk about land areas, and ask, is there an issue about areas? The answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in. 
It's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what's growing there, because there's so many people that don't really recognize a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter) So we have some people who designed these things, "If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this, help yourself." 
Dreadful. Thumbs down. 
He said, "That's all we can do, we've got to stop the smoke." 
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room. 
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school. 
And this leads to oddities. 
And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. 
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel. 
There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. 
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. 
We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. 
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize. 
I suppose it is, so I won't say revolution -- but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton, and of particles beyond that. 
So with disease models like these, we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster. 
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our experiments. You come into the lab, you see this computerized task. 
We didn't eat. 
It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra. 
So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out. 
It's certainly what I learned when I was training. 
They thought it'd be more innovative without it. 
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. 
So cows are dying, and cows are the most valued possession. 
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that. 
And this is a burglar alarm. 
This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. 
It's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. 
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death. 
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course, you do detailed analysis, and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species, known as Australopithecus afarensis. 
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why? 
It suggests that someone is driving. 
And then, of course, you have to do something about how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you. 
So you see, it's all intact, completely transparent. 
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this. 
I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire, which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway. 
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing. 
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. 
And once you've changed its state, it stays there until you change its state again. 
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress. 
Malaria is one of the great public health problems. 
And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it. 
So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. 
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intense this brain system is. 
There's a point, you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari. 
Therefore you will do well to act on the side, no matter how far into the laboratory you may go, to serve as teachers during the span of your career. 
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. 
Actually, she had never been to school, not to a lick, one day. 
And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. 
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. 
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful. 
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. 
Even if we get everybody working on it, we've got to be strategic. 
But with the robot, you can. 
I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time. 
I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how, through both conscious and unconscious design, we're impacting these invisible worlds. 
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater. 
You can have no budgets, no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level. 
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret, which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time, that we should always look forward and not backward, and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets. 
The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity, the added value, all helped drive sales. 
And then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life. 
It's a great challenge for them. 
ED: All right. Now last week, when I did this, you had me measure that spot to the right. 
She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere, Gemcitabine, Navelbine: Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow. 
So, what we do: It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this. 
But we're giving them practice becoming independent, which of course is our ultimate goal. 
They need your compassion. 
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components, and look at the diversity that came out of that. 
But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart, the human soul. 
Method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality, like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop. 
Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. 
(Laughter) My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation, by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail, and running them through and obstacle course, and found a decrement in performance, like you'd predict. 
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household. 
When I looked down at my plate, I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his. 
So, I had been there almost three months, and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around, he grabbed my hand for support, which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. 
Now this idea is not new. 
At pick-up time the teachers, who have been with your children all day, would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back. 
It's my life. 
That is in less than 60 years. 
So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells, we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve, or jump over damaged areas in the cortex, in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap produced by a stroke. 
I urge you to do something. 
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator? 
I thought you were going to hate me." 
So my coauthors and I have used computers, the greatest tool of our time, to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. 
I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action. 
It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. 
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is, and they breed in incredibly dense colonies. 
Let's make it Kogi." 
They made another machine to produce those people: the school. 
So if it's fundamentally a resource problem, where are the resources in society? 
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. 
Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain. 
That's the media environment we've got. 
Taking it forward, how do we change it? 
I was sure of it. 
I did not know where the beach was. 
The first one is silence. 
Massive technological advance: took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable. 
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country? 
We need to have more mobility choices. 
Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity. 
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. 
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally, one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife. 
And so ever since I think I was just six years old, I dreamed of going to the polar regions. 
I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her, and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. 
But not an applause of delight like before, an applause encouragement. 
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally, and then redistributed to basically service this industry, and you can even buy salvaged parts. 
You're wrong. 
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst. 
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids? 
And you see it in all sorts of technologies. 
Let me make a prediction for you, which is probably even more startling. 
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old, looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?" 
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful. 
This here is Nissan's MyLeaf, where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people, so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently. 
A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker. 
The baby wagged her tongue back. 
You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. 
And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships. 
And the secret is the ballot form. 
Thank you very much, guys. 
Isn't amazing? 
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya. 
I never will forget it. 
They got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it." 
A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. 
How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever? 
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon, and worse than that, burning one hectare of grassland gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants than 6,000 cars. 
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen, listen. 
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world. 
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved, and developmentally very early emerging, things that are online from the first weeks of life, we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months, and that's what we are doing now. 
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago. 
But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence, this incredible performance of Western economies. 
Then they give you, "Get ready." 
And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. 
You've got to work with the building department. 
We take muscle cells, we paste, or coat the outside with these muscle cells, very much like baking a layer cake, if you will. 
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free. 
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments, so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again. 
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking. 
We've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations. 
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area. 
They'll probably give you three new ones, right? 
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. 
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider. 
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow. 
You could inform school policy. 
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. 
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things. 
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish, is different, and our paths will be different, they are all stories. 
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. 
If I can ask an indiscreet question, how many of you have tattoos? 
(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. 
These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there's one out of the U.K. 
And this problem is: where are the plants? 
Thank you. 
Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause of disability, alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children. 
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. 
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day. 
And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996: "All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble." 
(Laughter) of origami-on-demand. 
And these are just some of the examples. 
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. 
It's not even mining. 
Two and a half thousand pounds. 
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it. 
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles, so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. 
This year, I got, what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea, to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards. 
It will take the work of generations to succeed. 
"We have no competition. There's nobody else who's ever made a widget like this." 
This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about. 
So far so good? 
Kenya is now speeding up. 
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south. 
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals, and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat, so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. 
So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish. 
A Dutch chocolate maker. 
Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish. 
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation. 
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now. 
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century, that scarcity started to get eroded -- and I don't mean by digital technology; I mean by analog technology. 
According to a Quranic verse "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." 
But maybe that's a little too obvious. 
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero, going forward, and then going backward. 
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. 
And for the first time, I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. 
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there's nothing artificial. 
I want to share all my love with you ... 
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. 
One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics, and sadly you can have humane moral principles, you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions, and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries, you can't do politics. 
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends. 
So what's superhydrophobic? 
But in that action, that interaction, by re-scripting that, by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate, that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent, which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally, binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive, effectively removing it from bioavailability. 
Thank you very much. 
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations. 
I relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly. 
So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric. 
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers." 
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention. 
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere. 
And here's what the same calculation looks like, which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years -- by a group called TRUCOST. 
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. 
Now, luckily, this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here: this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture -- there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny -- this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished. 
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. 
So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. 
That was back when the population was around 100 million people. 
My dad said to me, "That’s one" -- I’ll explain that. 
And nobody can tell me no. 
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art. 
There's a very short list of these places. 
For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment and free malaria treatment. 
Here's me singing "Sleep." 
Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. 
But I'm not going to explain it all to you. 
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate. 
I started to speak with the community, and I could convince everybody, and we could start to work. 
Your cat wants more food. 
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop, and then the magic happens. 
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake. 
But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. 
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets. 
I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. 
I now know that my real strength never came from my body, and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically, who I am is unchanged. 
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer. 
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration causes problems for our society, so we have to address it. 
That could pose a potential danger to the society, but who knows; we're in a globalized world, so they can look for girlfriends from other countries. 
But with Africa, let's start being careful about this. 
So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons, the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses. 
Then I made a book. 
You do know the solution to that, right? 
It selfishly copies. 
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted. 
And then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store. 
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities. 
If this was a war with two disparate sides, I, by default, fell on team gay, because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight. 
And so he looked at it, and he said, "Thank you. I'll look at it periodically." 
You make a tetrahedron like this. 
So that's how those images were made. 
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do? 
And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do. 
So the higher up the image, the more evidence there is for each supplement. 
Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute. 
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us. 
On this map, green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated. 
This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds. 
So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient. 
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you. 
Is that all there was?" 
Marcus: Because I do what I like? 
I have a little pad to make it a little softer. 
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms, who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. 
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
And the rest of us, the vast majority of us, struggle to get by. 
My six siblings and I were good kids, but caused our fair share of trouble. 
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years. 
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought, what can we do about it. 
He said, "I'm so proud of you." 
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami. 
And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams. 
What did Darwin say? 
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square, although we've looked at all of them. 
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. 
It challenges the norms. 
And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs. 
When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. 
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down. 
My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!" 
And it's with that thought that I'll end. 
These are the most primitive people in the world. 
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. 
It enables that conversation to get serious. 
There is always a better way to do things. 
Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans, but there are few who are going to school. 
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa, right here in Tibet. 
They won't move. They're not negotiating. 
So, then what do you do? 
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. 
Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls. 
And so what they do is they follow the scripts, but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. 
There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way. 
(Laughter) So how did it taste? 
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. 
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14. 
Do you think we'll make it?" 
What was his terrible crime? 
Thank you. 
NK: It cost him his life. 
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?" 
What crystals are possible, we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry. 
But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. 
A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy, called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife. 
I said, people should know about this book. 
But one thing was curious: most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later, not from the very divine core of Islam, the Koran, but from, again, traditions and mentalities, or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages. 
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor. 
Jobs. 
But I only represent those that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre, which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War. 
We'll see. 
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we all have to think the same. 
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches. 
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. 
Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success, it leads to success. 
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government, because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today. 
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor. 
Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals. 
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress. 
We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly. 
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. 
And I can only tell you that as a scientist, I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s watching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon. 
At 130, we start somewhere above 130, between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel so that you could build a bomb. 
But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam. 
Today we are making metals that are lighter than Styrofoam, so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can lift, but so strong that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV. 
Really, we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. 
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?" 
And it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. 
That pollution was money to that community, and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money. 
It opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. 
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12. 
And you did a very, very, very bad thing. 
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. 
You may recognize her. 
So the people kept it. 
(Laughter) Quick moment for the designers in the audience. 
So he got rid of the electricity, he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside, so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators. 
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. 
It's the system which underpins all these other systems. 
And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. 
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences. 
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. 
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke. 
Some of it will go back to your own pocket. 
It's really lovely. 
The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that. 
You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up. 
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit." 
It was taken in 1965. 
(Laughter) And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech, but I have a box of slides. 
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter) It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. 
(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. 
And what shall we do? 
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. 
It looks a bit like this. 
Our answer, of course, was yes. 
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing, difficult situation into a fun game. 
So, what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium. 
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients. 
So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up. 
When the person in front of me slows down. 
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here. 
But there came a moment when it all came together, and everything worked. 
I started to build a prototype like that. 
And we've looked at everything: more AIDS cases, flu, etc. 
When I put one card at a table -- look, it's not one card. It's -- look, it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. 
This song kind of came out of all of that. 
(Music) I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing, or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. 
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over. 
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction. 
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time. 
You know, thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes. 
It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. 
And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals. 
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears. 
But now we got Eagles out there, F15s, even that Bald Eagle. 
I mean, really. 
And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck, a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12,000 years ago, and this has caused a very low diversity. 
I began to be fascinated by plastic, so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent, as a kind of release of stress. 
The CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week. 
King Lear. 
Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?" 
What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?" 
Now, before I talk more about that technology, let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games. 
But nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than "Click here for a picture of my dog." 
If you ask this guy, what -- "all that glitters is not gold," The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold. 
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item. 
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847. 
(Laughter) TM: He's really modest, too. 
So it was a massive effort. 
And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains. 
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. 
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. 
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes, three commercial breaks and a laugh track. 
And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone, but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. 
So in wildlife rescue, as in life, we learn from each previous experience, and we learn from both our successes and our failures. 
The thing about computers is, I love computers. 
I've seen my people die like flies. 
Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. 
By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average. 
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?" 
I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. 
There was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital, as it changed over time. 
So we naturally tend to think, because we see language written so often, that that's what language is, but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things. 
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling. 
You can't catch me. 
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. 
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground -- what's called the heel lift. 
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word -- I hope to have an interest in the English language, but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter) I'm trying. That clock has got me. 
The government is not successful on these things. 
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. 
But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff. 
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos. 
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" -- these are how you get around the community. 
Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. 
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so, science has kind of blurred this distinction between non-living and living systems, and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. 
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil? 
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight. 
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late. 
Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span. 
The first of them is the obvious one, the silicon revolution, which you all are very, very familiar with. 
He had some very complex models of how to survive. 
Let's have a look at the third question. 
And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. 
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country, as well as a public service innovation lab. 
So this is a typical menu. 
I am a native of Burkina Faso. 
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand, so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago. 
(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner) Okay. 
It's keeping the lights on. 
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with, and the question that keeps us up at night, is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu, and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases? 
Don't even worry. 
(Laughter) Frogs. 
And then globalization is taking place. 
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found. 
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister. 
It doesn't change key, the notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music. 
So we need to start getting better. 
And when my dad tells the story, he says, "The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread. 
It's a decent life for children, we are talking about. 
And if you're an educator in any way, again, look at how religions are spreading ideas. 
But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. 
So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings, I ask people to go on a walking meeting, to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week. 
We got a human, someone who's very outgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection, and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experience what she was experiencing, so they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly, they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go, and then conveying those to the Tele-Actor. 
MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story. 
We will have the ear of Congress. 
(Laughter) Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that "discovery" and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying, "But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big." 
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are, wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this? 
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma," transforming the American theater. 
And we are educating our kids, having fewer kids, basically good news all around. 
My family ... What can I say? 
And the name came out Jack. I'm like, "Woooo! 
But the point is, this is all good news, because when something is predictable, it is what I call designable. 
Observe from a distance, but do not join the fray. 
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway? 
And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere, and moving from one spot to another. 
I know you did because half of Americans do every day. 
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system, and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated, and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it. 
Well, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come. 
You still with me? (Laughter) I called her up. 
And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy, all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. 
And here's what she answered: "Just do it." 
And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind. 
And so I went about and made that sculpture, turning it out of solid bronze. 
With nuclear, those who know the most are the least worried. 
We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice. 
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction. 
It was ending up in landfills. 
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish, maybe comes back to home base, goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. 
When I walked across Afghanistan, I stayed with people like this. 
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that. 
And so you can see, literally, signs of their shock, signs of their outrage, signs of their anger, and signs of their grief. 
They have the social connectedness. 
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived. 
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year. 
Thank you very much. 
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive. 
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. 
Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens. 
And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes. 
So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways. Grab them while you can. 
You need to take them out of search engines, you need to take them out of online directories, you need to take them out of user lists. 
But as we envisioned it, we had three key goals: Providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams, and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency, irrespective of the capability to pay. 
So the more radical the innovation, the more the uncertainty, the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. 
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt. 
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves, protein and oil. 
And he explained to me that, when I shave, I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is, but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair, and this creates lack of symmetry. 
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago. 
It is the hot topic. 
And I said, "Do you really?" 
I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them. 
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem, because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. 
Their symmetry, their attractive materials and, above all, their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes, even today. 
Okay? And then celebrities started. 
Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration, a migration to the suburbs. 
(Video) Lil Demon: ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫ ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫ Chris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man, a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu, who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. 
"ElectriCity." 
That completes the quadruple. 
And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs where people were asked, take your whole life and please sum this up into six words, such as these here: "Found true love, married someone else." 
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. 
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody, not just Julian Assange, have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on, scrutinizing, informing others, and even organizing collective responses. 
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani," which means "Electricity, water and roads." 
But then, we're just a community group, you know. 
It can get sideways like a rally car driver, always able to take the tightest curve, even on slippery, changing surfaces, never spinning out. 
All the power comes from the sun. 
That's pretty much it. 
They must know three things: They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head. 
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships. 
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? 
We could go up into the millions of polygons. 
So, I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip. 
We love to circle around things. 
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. 
They have drive, passion, commitment. 
And, again, all of it promoting transparency. 
That is civilization -- and in its soil grow continually freedom, comfort and culture," what all TEDsters care about most. 
They jeer at you. 
So I'm here to -- I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus, the one we call factivism. 
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor. 
I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. 
So in planning to be a professional naturalist -- I never considered anything else in my entire life -- I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. 
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. 
And I turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home, and just at that moment, you came out of the Student Union building wearing the stupidest hat I have ever seen in my life." (Laughter) "It was awesome. 
Is it really a border on the map? 
The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. 
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with. 
I know, because I've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years. 
They have electricity, but the question is, how many have washing machines? 
My mother fell very ill. 
The National Movement of India was testimony to that. 
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization. 
(Applause) Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion. 
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse. 
This is, then, how they're presented. 
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus, which is about as big as the British Isles. 
The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India. 
But these are tricks around the margins. 
So there were 66,000 of these. 
I want to believe, and you do too. 
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. 
In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck, Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised, and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend -- fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi -- played by Fraser James. 
Most people will say, "Emotions are terribly hard. 
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school. 
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes -- it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes. 
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. 
It's about death. 
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another. 
We don’t know, but it may be. 
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is, again, wirelessly enabled. 
And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks, oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again. 
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever. 
A couple of years ago, I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment. 
"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine, Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory." 
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce. 
Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger. 
He said, "You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs?" 
You make yourself the active voice. 
I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well-conducted. 
You just press it. 
What kind of criteria did it use? 
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace, with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence. 
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder, who laughed like the sunrise, who came from that place called America, which is so far from here, that if a young man should travel there, he would be an old man when he arrived. 
And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside. 
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. 
This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek. 
as the number one market for luxury brands -- that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere. 
Now, we basically have to change our views slightly. 
Solly remained on the bank. 
The hub, ironically enough, is centered in little Roanoke, Virginia. 
We sell all the student books. 
And while I was making the book, I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens. 
Hope kept me alive. 
So they survived or they failed together, which means that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution. 
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. 
(Laughter) I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96, and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style," she said she would treasure it. 
That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside, even with the best of intents. 
They have here Qatar. 
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles, giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates. 
That's for you guys, action video game players. 
So she and I had a delightful conversation. 
And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally. 
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared. 
So, this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system. 
Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. 
But technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself. 
I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like 100,000 tests, something of that kind. 
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place. 
And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem. 
Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer? 
For you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes. 
Rather, local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. 
So what we're trying to do is do reactions -- not in one flask, but in tens of flasks, and connect them together, as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes. 
Now, notice, something interesting -- Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. 
Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally. 
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error. 
And there was a rock that I always missed. 
Now how do the two brains work with each other? 
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home. 
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market." 
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off, and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out to the ship, and when he got there, they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie, and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore, and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter) And then once that cable was on shore, they began to prepare to connect it to the other side, 
Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? 
But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology, an interface to do two-way communication, and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. 
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically. 
So I whistled along with him. 
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere. 
(Laughter) So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids. 
Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television. 
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs. 
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie. 
Now this is important for two reasons. 
These are entanglement scars. 
In a way, it's the story of my life. 
It's a cold war, really. 
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one. 
So, what have we learned from this about cheating? 
Take a look at this. 
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. 
This innovation is from the slums of Rio. 
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination of smart people, smart technology and smart investments, polio can now be eradicated anywhere. 
So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony. 
That's me and my son on the floor. 
So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind, or something else. 
And these electrons, while flowing, they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy. 
Why is this market worth getting at over here? 
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it. 
And it's political. 
So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor. 
And then in Kenya, what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity, which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. 
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake? 
"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. 
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population. 
As you focus on the wooden form, it rotates. 
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. 
We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion. 
We all lose. 
(Applause) "When the crisis came, the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent." 
And when I complained to my grandmother, a World War II veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13, that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas, I would never ever, ever find another job, she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things. 
And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design. 
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this. 
And it's pretty amazing actually. 
In particular, I thought about my dad, who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. 
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. 
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. 
And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around, and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that." 
I'm not taking sides. 
Yeah, there you go. 
Again, this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. 
And if you zoom in, you can definitely watch this, grandparents with their grandchildren, distributing the natural enemies, the good bugs, instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. 
And through this we will have clean water. 
And we're never given a reason why we should play. 
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders. 
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be. 
And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans, so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society. 
The deforestation, especially for oil palm, to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems. 
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. 
Thank you so much. 
But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player. 
Lots of different kinds. 
Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing. 
Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics. 
And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. 
There's one challenge symbolized at the top, but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom. 
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. 
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all the correspondence, it posts it up there, and it becomes an archive of public knowledge. 
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. 
I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history. 
I had a friend, a history major like me, who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, by an anxiously perspiring European saying, "You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?" 
I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life, in myself. 
I got a female instructor first, to teach me the female role, the follow, because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college. 
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. 
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit, to transfer that information now, directly into the factory. 
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets, the worker in an industrial factory has no control, no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work. 
They've come together. 
American pollution does not come from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes, and the amount that people are driving in your city, your urban VMT, is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. 
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team. 
Then I was telling my assistant, "I don't see anything. Can you paint it?" 
Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. 
But we only need to replace them once. 
And of course, at Ground Zero what else? 
We paid two to three times more than anybody else. 
And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. 
If you haven't, I recommend playing it. 
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career. 
My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles. 
The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct" makes the case that, "The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation." 
We're taking off. 
They way outweigh Democrats. 
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. 
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. 
Heroes: How do we view leadership? 
This is one piece of good news. 
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game, with surprising twists and turns along the way. 
In other words, water is the lifeblood. 
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. 
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well, I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all. 
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong? 
How many other people? 
Talk about what you heard here. 
I like to think of myself as a storyteller, where my past and my future are only stories, my stories, waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200-year story. 
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future? 
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago. 
So the challenge was, how are we going to bring light and expose these things? 
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not, because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions. 
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event. 
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. 
She thought my side beat up on her side way more often, that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists, and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. 
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, which was, by the way, patriarchy. 
But don't take my word for it. 
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom. 
Usually I say no right away, but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings. 
Where should we be redeveloping? 
And when we do that, our neighbors -- be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country -- The sum of the local is the global. 
The younger brother is 86, the older one’s 95; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. 
A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate, and overcome the heckler. 
It's nearly halfway around the globe. 
RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually "Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols." 
He's going back to check the control holes again, but he's coming back to the first one, and now he's locking into that smell, which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field, and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria. 
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior. 
These are very compelling, vivid sensations. 
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you. 
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do. 
Also proud to have relocated here to Boston, where I actually grew up. 
It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting. 
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org, it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time. 
Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. 
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. 
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it. 
And the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of Aboriginal communities. 
Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off, the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. 
Now remember here what Jefferson said. 
That's the first invention that I wanted to describe. 
All right, good. These are all the liars. 
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. 
So we developed a different approach. 
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work. 
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people working on it for a while, and then more and more people started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet, and more and more people started using it. 
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite? 
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner. 
DK: So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention. 
The world is full of wonder. 
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks. 
Bet on good people doing good things." 
So right now, in my lab, we're combining state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date, modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do. 
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism. 
So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good? 
(Laughter) And so this is part of what life is, but it's not all of what life is. 
We talk about it ambivalently. 
A load cell measures forces, and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. 
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. 
Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. 
It's the great Art Tatum -- DP: Art Tatum. 
We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. 
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible. 
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace, treats them as a network and trains them to produce better, even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors. 
Carl Norden was born in 1880. 
I almost lost it this week. 
And it's an important issue because it means that we have to, as a society, think about what we value. 
Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee. 
Because it told me, by God, one person got it. 
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language, and then I'll draw that connection. 
Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. 
A lot of potential of young children is wasted. 
And this is of a student of mine named Joseph who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab. 
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes. 
So that's a very handsome return. 
(Applause) YAB: You can also go to the website, answer -- respond to the questions also. 
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars. 
Watch what happens when we drop some out. 
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic. 
And when they brought her case to the judge, for the first time he stood up and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released." 
So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together, you know, make something, I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you. 
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. 
By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. 
You must have taken tea in the morning. 
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes. 
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later. 
This brings up a really important point, which is that we tend in this country to talk about Democrats and Republicans and think there's this little group over there called independents that's, what, two percent? 
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley, who’s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford. 
And then, what I'm saying is, is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex. 
Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker? 
I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me. 
We need, for instance, to bring in radiant cooling technology, and we need to combine this with so-called soft conditioning. 
Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery. 
And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. 
And I'm not in the present whatsoever. 
We shut one down that was going to be big. 
My wife and I adore our children. 
(Laughter) And rich men are afflicted. 
(Laughter) And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. 
I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital, the rise of Indian entrepreneurs, the rise of English as a language of aspiration, technology as something empowering, globalization as a positive factor, and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before. 
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age. 
Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter) Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy. 
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know, the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it, and it's just my call to say to all of us, public policy won't change this at all; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. 
The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November. 
They're talking about slavery in 1860. 
With complete control of everything the audience can see, moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. 
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law, you have a problem. (Laughter) So, all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it's related to how we teach the children. 
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. 
It was then that Abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before. 
I want to fix our education system. 
This boy here in the middle of central India -- this is in a Rajasthan village, where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process, they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. 
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. 
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months. 
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention, getting you to look over that way. 
What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world? 
(Video) Boy: How about this? 
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin, and you can borrow it." 
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. 
About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away, and she was going to drive them in her car, but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. 
I just extended it." 
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar, from flowers -- in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins -- but the female needs the blood meal. 
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. 
Now, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are, to be on the brink of true global social organization. 
There's something in New York City. 
It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped. 
He was never informed of the results of the test. 
We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured, and then we led that to the current prototype. 
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. 
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent. 
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I? 
And with that, I thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor. 
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. 
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works. 
(Laughter) He said, "Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City, and it's going to be in January of '35?" 
And at noon each day the campers would go to a pond, where they had floating docks. 
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. 
And he made a checkmark. 
So I asked the girls, "How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers?" 
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. 
I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS, and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know. 
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air. 
"You need to come." 
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky, so it's very hard to observe animals underwater, but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. 
The first is, I think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings. 
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray. 
They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there. 
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. 
It's like a managed competition of sleep. 
How many of you are single? Any single people out there? 
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola. 
(Laughter) And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations. 
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks. 
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars. 
For example, why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA, totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus? 
And I said, "So what were you doing?" 
And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine." 
So these are the components. 
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said, "I don't know why we are here. 
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities. 
They also get free land in between the trees, where they can grow their crops. 
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan, and I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't. 
You've started one or two in your time. 
That's why it's intuitive. 
Small pulley and two strong magnets. 
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. 
It would be unconscionable. 
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways. 
And more controversially, recently, Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks. 
I also researched extensively on bows around the world. 
This was the result. 
What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents? 
She Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. 
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. 
This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried: These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people, but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks. 
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond. 
And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck. 
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital, probably squeaky clean. 
In order to understand this, we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half. 
It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting, a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own. 
What you expect is basically what you observe. 
It's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod, and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama: it actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill. 
It's interesting to me. 
But look what happened in the course of that century. 
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. 
That's a non-zero-sum game. 
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet. 
It was a little over 100 years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. 
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay? 
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. 
That causes a huge drop in the value. 
And when the doctor begins the visit, she knows height, weight, is there food at home, is the family living in a shelter. 
I'm being told where to play on the drum. 
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities, like softness, breathability, durability, elasticity and even things like pattern. 
The economic challenges facing us are hard, but when I walk the factory floor, and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected, and I see the difference this makes in a hospital, in an airport, in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic, I'm enthusiastic. 
When Andy stepped down, he said, "No technology will win. Technology itself will win." 
I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive. 
It's great. 
The present self does not want to save at all. 
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. 
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something." 
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" 
And we keep sending more every day. 
So what's going to solve this? 
Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals. 
You see some fun stuff happening here. 
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees. 
Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically. 
(Laughter) And so this is what I did. 
We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. 
So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer. 
But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left, maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible. 
The rest turns into a stable compound, which survives filtration into the water systems, thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains. 
We have to first know what a foot is. 
(Laughter) I don't know. 
In those days there was still countryside close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests. 
When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst. 
(Laughter) Obvious, right. 
It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. 
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. 
So these animals are wonderfully aggressive, and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it. 
People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
And he said, "Oh, that's great. 
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. 
(Laughter) The next poem is also rather short. 
Mother went into a coma. 
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating. 
Oh, it's so familiar to me. 
This is what we're doing. 
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. 
So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold, and not have it deducted from my number of wishes. 
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. 
What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. 
What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. 
And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States. 
I'm the only one who's left in India. 
Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. 
She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road. 
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. 
I was in a bit of a spot. 
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place. 
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible. 
This is the critical period for sound development, but what's going on up there? 
In fact, I use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom. 
(Laughter) We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether. 
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question, we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet. 
A real school. 
And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate, we've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica, and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things in R &amp; D and education, lots of other areas. 
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up. 
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is sitting under the table. 
♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫ ♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫ ♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫ ♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫ ♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫ ♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫ ♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫ 
But it really wants you to enter all your activity. 
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality. 
And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. 
Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.) Man: One, two, three, four folds we make. 
Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years, far less divided on religious-secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy. 
But we can look at the world, and try to understand where we are in its context, and how we choose to interact with it. 
And not only is it empowering to the communities, but really importantly, this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices. 
The irony is palpable; technical access has never been greater, cultural access never weaker. 
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds? 
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out? 
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act, you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. 
I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today. 
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth. 
Hers is more into boys. 
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this. 
Johanna Blakley: Imagine that. 
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available. 
And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes. 
That is, for men, 29 percent in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes, and women, although it's less, it's terribly high. 
Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. 
Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system. 
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. 
If you really look at the power of exponential growth, you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. 
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't. 
It's important because if you solve these problems, you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. 
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right, and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world, and then make it understood. 
Well, there's two really good reasons for this. 
I opened my refrigerator on my own. 
Well, solar power airplanes are not new. 
They said, "Al Qaeda could be listening." 
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong. 
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification. 
So I started researching, and to my surprise, this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. 
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. 
There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you. 
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly. 
There are starfish that can make light. 
Thirdly, when Norden was making his calculations, he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. 
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. 
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn. 
And when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman, as Barbara does here with her husband, they don't get the treatment. 
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems. 
In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me information for three years, average, 24th of September, so late September. 
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles. 
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. 
And that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology, in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology. 
Good job! Yeah! 
They put them in foam, little containers. 
I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages, coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. 
It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me. 
And then it's never good enough. 
One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. 
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa. 
It was the fact she was going so slow. 
There are lines in front of the one on the right, and there are lines behind the one on the left, and so it takes it into different planes. 
And it was this stuff, this, where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter. 
And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. 
Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas -- where it was, and how much it cost -- and then appended the keyword "#atlgas" which let other people search for that and find gas themselves. 
So how do organizations think? 
And it took 18 months. 
More of our economics is global in scale. 
The street she lived on was unpaved, her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me. 
It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones. 
So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system, and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball. 
These comics are now going to the New York festival. 
DNA repair genes are more active in these animals. 
Japanese Mother: [Japanese] Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. 
This is our first architectural model. 
Will WiMax CDMA G3 be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say. 
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them, and telling them to do all kinds of awful things. 
And these are our dreams. 
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate -- I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes." 
Beautiful? Maybe lesser. 
And today, we're producing it from your old stuff, and it's going right back into your new stuff. 
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. 
And it turns out it's a more general case -- there's a lot of mistakes we do. 
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life. 
But we have, somehow, in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades, started to cultivate an image of a mythical, rural agricultural past. 
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall, but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. 
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. 
Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which I think we all care about: health and education. 
Well, you have to hold people accountable. 
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess. 
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap. 
You can bring your husband along. 
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was." 
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically." 
I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever, so you know, I slowed down. 
And they go up to the cath lab and boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot. 
They'd just begun to light up a little bit, open up a little bit. 
Neither of us had tried to change the other. 
And it starts with three people. 
And innovation is disruptive. 
Awww. 
And the head of the council said, "If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time." 
How can I understand those invisible forces?" 
And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. 
It's a phenomenal thing. 
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. 
She's some other woman pretending to be my mother." 
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation, and I find this remarkable. 
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want. 
And then as we go further, today we have continuous glucose sensors. 
Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way, we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to 10 words. 
And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology. 
(Laughter) AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side -- I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me? 
If you want to put a colored disk, well all these seven colors coalesce. 
I'm a voracious reader, a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. 
And I would use this study, a recent study by Philip Landrigan, to motivate a different view of health, where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on. 
And I came home and I said to my father and mother, "I just met this man: doesn't have much work, and he's sort of ugly, funny voice, and he's a teacher at school. 
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. 
And because of this, we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology. 
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. 
(Laughter) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days. 
So they found this "cagoots" guy, a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic, who was known, had been known for months, to be literally defecating on himself, talking nothing that made any sense, and they brought him into the hospital. 
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project. 
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities. 
It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue, and I was to sit in one place like a statue would. 
But in fact, this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. 
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand? 
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence, which is not much different from what a kid does. 
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place. 
And so, there are always — (Laughter) (Applause) — there are always people worrying about these things and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning. 
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions. 
My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. 
The other possibility -- (Laughter) -- is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. 
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. 
It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. 
Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war" is that we have to acknowledge that Islam, as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people, was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- and as a consequence, at one degree of remove, the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. 
you might be able to look at brain activity and say, "This person's going to be a good poker player," or, "This person's socially naive," and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. 
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight. 
And just the surface appearance are often -- like the Astroturf here -- they make me wince. 
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. 
This is a picture of it. 
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. 
It says, "Africa: Open for Business." 
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage, the cartilage never comes back. 
"What do you want to do in a village? 
Here we go. (Laughter) This little baby has a lot of horsepower. 
And it's not just in terms of sex. 
It's a debate about words, about metaphors. 
And yet, how did it start? 
And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience: how are the brains of men and women different? 
If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital -- in other words, corporate profits -- we see them going up, and we see that they're now at an all-time high. 
(Applause) Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting, commerce and social connectivity, but where did it all come from? 
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells. 
And we ended up with 10 statements. 
And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David. 
We want peace." 
And it all started almost a decade ago, as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company at their first African office in Johannesburg. 
And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. 
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. 
I mean, if they'd have just taken that, taken Peter Dodson's work, and gone on with that, then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have. 
I have been there for a long time. 
Here's our winner of the soprano solo. 
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men. 
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out. 
This program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools. 
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. 
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away, so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan. 
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph. 
(Laughter) Yeah. And then come the news crews, and the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor. 
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. 
If you look at where they're located -- and on this slide it's the red blobs on there -- there are five that are operating in the Mid-East, and the rest of them are in the United States. 
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. 
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. 
But I'm sorry, the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. 
And his story was hushed as he assimilated. 
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system trying to preserve itself. 
It's unaffordable globally. 
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote. 
Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people, is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more. 
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true. 
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread. 
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax. 
But hey, sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come. 
And in most parts of the world, that top is still controlled by men. 
And typically, there is a lot of variation, but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle, which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water, lives for 10 or 11 months. 
(Applause) The coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." 
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home. 
Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying. 
And the way you should do that is study the furniture, let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself, and then a few days later, go with your gut, because unconsciously you've figured it out. 
And he had a real passion for golf, and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. 
We are now installing larger powerplants, which will make it possible for me to get back on board. 
Of those that don't abort, atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development in the exposed daughters in utero, so that their breast don't develop properly. 
I work in global poverty. 
(Laughter). 
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America. 
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean. 
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. 
For instance, take these sea turtles. 
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them. 
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies. 
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb. 
So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure. 
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids. 
In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004, 250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005, 85,000 dead, the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead, more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry — in all of these instances, we see partnerships between international actors, interagency, private-public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster. 
Now, why the hell would we bother to do this? 
And up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle, like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view, and a sort of dense urban location. 
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty. 
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. 
It might be deadly. 
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are, but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. 
So I started wondering and pondering, could it be that the best years of American economic growth are behind us? 
It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. 
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me, he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. 
How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us? 
We're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil, about right and wrong. 
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. 
And when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like Barbara in the movie -- they get treated. 
What you’re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root, and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. 
(Laughter) Because I think, as well as the awe of looking at that, I'm sure some people here are thinking, technology catches up so quick, how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the White House? 
It's an art of communication. 
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. 
And we see this among activist, practical Muslims, like the Muslims who are presently the elected, parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey, who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically, who are promoting their own religious values, who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values, but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible. 
Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality, its duration, but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait. 
And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy. 
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation. 
(Applause) This is how war starts. 
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff, and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department. 
The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state. 
And the third said, "Let's find another director." 
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better. 
And so whether that genius is placed into -- technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West -- or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth, is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. 
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar. 
When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent -- when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting. 
And let me give you a few illustrations. 
Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm. 
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life, we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others. 
It's a facility which is practically unmanned. 
There are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest, or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies. 
The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?" 
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. 
So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world. 
This is sort of the munch of the penguins. 
You have to say, well, blackness of skin, you couldn't suffer just for that. 
It's an ongoing process your whole life. 
So, if you really want to help these workers, start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes in these schools, and what's going to happen is, all your workers are going to move on, but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple, and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement. 
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive, which is the making of shoes. 
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available. 
(Applause) And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go. 
A challenge, of course. 
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps, than people who have never done that kind of work. 
The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land. 
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides: the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters, the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers, if you like, the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently, the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries. 
So we can describe the communication between the neurons. 
The first image I showed the building committee was this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur because I talked about what makes a building a building of science. 
We have visions like this. We have visions like this. 
After a few years, between five and seven years, fish come back, they eat the urchins, and then the algae grow again. 
And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder. 
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism, and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes. 
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was. 
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what. 
The rule is going to be this. 
And with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess, female tiger shark, I sort of think I got to that goal, where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose, and my strobe created a shadow on her face. 
And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we're on the eleventh floor. 
And as you think about it, let me close with an example of the brain. 
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations. 
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing -- I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing -- I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. 
The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance, and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place. 
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. 
And I didn't want to be a colorist. 
Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate. 
The lists go on and on. 
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women, so men do this more than women -- we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally. 
The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century. 
One thing we noticed with "The Sims," which is a game I did earlier, is that players love making stuff. 
And now both of these can climb better, move faster, swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons. 
Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx. 
But the problem is, as Foucault points out, that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side. 
Half of them deserted to go look for gold. 
Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had. 
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years. 
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs. 
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers? 
If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected. 
He can't walk. Anybody know the story? 
A super value, in terms of their ability to ride in a car, to get that dignity, to get that safety, looks practically impossible, isn't it. 
You know. 
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance. 
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you. 
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth. 
Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture, but while he was beginning to do his work, all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula. 
Now, many events can be subject to either construal, kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions, in which you can either pay attention to the particular object, in which case the space around it recedes from attention, or you can see the faces in the empty space, in which case the object recedes out of consciousness. 
We can mimic nature, but in some ways also improve upon it. 
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. 
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system. 
I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed. 
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well. 
The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs, we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom -- that in fact, across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative. 
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost. 
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews. 
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity. 
But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way. 
An infection ravaged my skin. 
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled. 
So here's what we think we want to do: Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously. 
So I brought back the rabbit, the dragonfly, to stay in that street. 
And we go through this several rounds. 
These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. 
And I said to the translator, "What did he say?" 
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here. 
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent. 
Didn't read anything. "There it is." 
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion? 
And you have this very strongly to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days, these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. 
While laying there dying, all he could say was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away." 
That's just a decade away. 
But the result is always to have stories. 
And in this case, they did. 
We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. 
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom! 
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity, "Captain, OSHA." 
This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. 
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies. 
And I'm going to only talk about the mass. 
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now, but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya -- "so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me, and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today." 
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning. 
So let me summarize where we are. 
We need to move one step beyond that now. 
Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems. 
And with knowing comes caring. 
And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020. 
But Joseph Brodsky said that, "It is poetry that is gained in translation," suggesting that translation can be a creative, transformative act. 
I want to show you two slides, but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington -- to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this? 
How about augmenting the physician? 
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there ever since, for the last seven years. 
That's a hopeful message, but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. 
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects, because they say the first thing they have to do, the first five minutes of any show, is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron. 
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. 
We who are diplomats, we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states. 
We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years. 
Three options: Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants? 
The men are going fishing in these small boats. 
I like that. 
So anyways, there are all these things you can do, but the thing I love the most is to experience, taste the world. 
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment. 
It's a several thousand-pound animal. 
And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry, and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company, a multinational. 
A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. 
Who could ever wish it on their own? 
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial. 
And he said, "She's telling me that I'm messy, and I have to clean up my room." 
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing, that it exploded in my face, never to return to the ballroom dancing club. 
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard, and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate. 
How appealing is that? 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. 
I don't know what the answer is to that. 
And I think that's really what architecture is based on. 
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly. 
Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs, and it's associated with. 
A lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick, so I think the average will be 50." 
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving. 
And that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down, and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out. 
And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design. 
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living. 
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey. 
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad, they don't have health care systems. 
Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic, in the North Sea in particular, and also the east coast of North America fairly well. 
What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud. 
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done. 
You can see here, the small planets dominate the picture. 
And they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward." 
And what first attracted me, or interested me, was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure, sort of rusty, this industrial relic. 
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. 
We can take a movie of what's going on, but even if we single stepped this movie, it's tricky to see what's going on. 
Now, I'm not anti-hospital. 
But robots are still not in our home, ironically. 
And life starts to expand and expand and expand, until it goes kaput. 
And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright, and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. 
For example, communality applies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it. 
I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are, without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless. 
If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner, what I get is the following. 
And the idea of now creating implants, scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into 3D data and we can create very specific implants for them. 
Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation, we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. 
And, in fact, to understand it, I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science. 
Therefore I believe it should not be cool. 
They're born without spots, and they get spots with age, and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases, so that's fun to track their behavior. 
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. 
And we all want to believe in President Obama. 
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store. 
(Laughter) CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do? 
And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this. 
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us. 
It's not our struggle. 
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea. 
So, who is next? Us? 
And we heard that Rob was OK, but Doug was too weak to come down. 
She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. 
But this was not the case. 
Thank you. 
Dubai, to me, is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen. 
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. 
I read a dictionary. I got into college. 
It doesn't work. 
I just wanted to show that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below. 
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone. 
(Laughter) At first they're a little freaked out. 
So, what I'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars, although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place. 
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. 
You'll find it inside of you. 
Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff. 
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years, I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert. 
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. 
And why is the physiology different? 
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all, and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy, but also enjoy how it happens. 
Where you're not doing. It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun, and when it died out from under me, that was one of the most liberating things because I could create. 
So you went from public space to private space. 
So, you can't get a smaller ham. 
Do you hate Americans? 
The reality, now here is something important. 
(Applause) I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. 
I am, of course, referring to none other than Elvis Presley. 
They even applaud it. 
So, tiny moon. 
We make judgments on people's faces all the time. 
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas, coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this. 
(Laughter) Because what you can do is take your problem, and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions. 
But life expectancy in this country is only 78. 
But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration. 
The next recording you're going to hear was made of the same humpback song 50 miles away. 
Thank you very much. 
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. 
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. 
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you? 
The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions out into the public was a piece of technology, but the thing that kept them there was political will. 
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations, but expanding at a tremendous rate. 
In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more. 
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message. 
That was the only figure he recognized. 
What exactly to the people watching this do every day? 
with a black object and point it right at you, and you can look at it as long as you want." 
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves. 
All this still persists. 
I think these are the four principles that go into this. 
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries. 
So, we’ll go with the first piece. 
Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. 
And you even find a church. 
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you. 
And I was thinking, "We didn't give them support and encouragement; they gave it to us. 
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes. 
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well. 
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." 
We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ... 
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing. 
So even before that impact was known, even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution, scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes: Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life. 
I mean, you lose. 
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio. 
And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade. 
That's the living room. 
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks, and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think, that's a great support group. 
Maybe God doesn't do things at all. 
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid -- if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past. 
During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died, except for a few, which were euthanized. 
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-older, that the thing that came to mind was, "How do you come into her world? 
And so you're standing there and everything else is dark, but there's this portal that you want to jump in. 
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great." 
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think. 
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. 
We narrowed it down to one fragment; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene. 
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place. 
So, it was so bad. 
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions. 
So, download it and have fun with it. 
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot. 
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance. 
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another, but really worryingly, 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of American teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. 
(Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. 
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed, but -- I speak of the life force -- her hair was askew. 
DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth. 
And we know why, right? 
In real wonder, two years later, I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars. 
This is not the very distant future. 
Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet. 
We just do. We have to. (Applause) We've come a long way since the days of the Polaroid. 
If economics, if the market, drives security, and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security, then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure. 
You're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots, so that you can run, fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish. 
You have to create a new profession. 
And I went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. 
It kills people in the prime of their lives. 
I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy. 
You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class, in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. 
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010, to four cents a mile in 2015, to two cents a mile by 2020. 
Transparency is about the communication of information. 
Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract. 
I love it that we have a global language. 
Year after year after year, absolutely incredible. 
So we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. 
I have a very peculiar background, attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer. 
So I've started working with a few hundred kids, and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age, to be bathed in bits. 
Now, let me hit a somber note. 
And here is a surprise. 
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits, but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. 
Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable, predictable, repeatable. 
Her story has a positive ending, but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate. 
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world, this prevailing kind of force of security. 
I mean literally, they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in. 
The night before a match I'm very nervous. 
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause) DH: One more, one more. 
(Applause) In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. 
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves. 
And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point, that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to. 
The Leuna chemical plant, after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war, was up and running within weeks. 
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust. 
She was a crystallographer. 
Because he grew? 
So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one, then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one. 
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments, they stopped cheating. 
And then we understand what is terroir. 
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating. 
Why? Because that's what we need. 
This ain't going to be my last movie. 
You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue, if you pair that odor with a shock. 
So that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love. 
And they had already started building the sewers in London, and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. 
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give." 
She does it with only one age-old gesture. 
Thank you very much for looking and listening. 
And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions, being 150 meters away. 
Why is everyone crying?" 
But shipping isn't that. 
Which is appropriate, because actually, this approach is not innovative. 
Little robots are cute when they play music to you. 
The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here, is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. 
R&amp;D in total in the economy, publicly funded, is about 0.6 percent of GDP. 
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned. 
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. 
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out, we think we can shorten that process quite substantially. 
(Singing) Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. 
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. 
We've got to do whatever we can to help them, but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs, to a better balance of economy and society. 
Which way will these fall? 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. 
Thank you. 
It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine. 
And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you, I mean, surely there are huge risks with that. 
They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. 
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets. 
We haven't even started the American stockpile. 
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right. 
If you want to find the big new ideas, it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets, in big organizations. 
So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother, and as we're going across the ocean, following these rules, she realizes that she's rolling pretty high, and she says to me, "We're not going to make it." 
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. 
This is Van Quach. 
We had a little natural experiment. 
The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller, more accessible place. 
and she said, "Probably never." 
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics. 
And when I was making icons, I was, like, the icon master, and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know. 
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. 
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. 
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games. 
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. 
It's really an island continent. 
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh! 
Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker. 
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C. 
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event, and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. 
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? 
And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him. 
It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention. 
And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs, but the consumers -- as in us -- had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products. 
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office. 
So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China. 
There was an interest in what was going on. 
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable; you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina, you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate. 
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade -- going to every household in the village, every household in the whole of Thailand, giving AIDS information and a condom to every household, given by these young kids. 
And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo. 
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that. 
So, I hope that we can also keep some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea. 
(Laughter) Think about the possibility, why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family? 
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it. 
Some of them are more experienced. 
So the first way that we did this. 
Tell us why your science is relevant to us. 
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of gray piece of wood. 
And if we do enough of these kinds of things, the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different. 
We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds of thrust, built by the lowest bidder. 
Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK. 
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated, but everybody gets the idea. 
Well you know, she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her. 
In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting. 
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life. 
Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. 
How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don't have a moral framework? 
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion. 
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side. 
Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. 
I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions. 
So I did. That's Paris. 
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished. 
So, I always tell my students, "Work smart, then work hard." 
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia. 
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. 
For a start, we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves. 
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice? 
And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. 
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. 
It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard, and they put some reflective markers on your body, and instead of using cameras, there're infrared sensors around a volume, and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time. 
The big questions facing physics. 
And after the war was over, there was an audit done -- as the army always does, the air force always does -- and they asked the question: how many Scuds did we actually destroy? 
And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place. 
Can you imagine? "Well, you should invest in my company because it's really good." 
But I wanted to try and enrich him. 
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun. 
And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board. 
That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s. 
(Laughter) But the fact is, there's good people everywhere. 
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important. 
It actually got harder. 
In the five years ending with 2010, Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. 
So to our blueprint, we split some hairs. 
And as you think of that, what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells. 
And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) Not that you do; I'm just saying. 
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy. 
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race, that we were talking about poverty, that we were talking about inequality. 
Who could blame them? 
So that overmatched capability creates problems -- catastrophic successes the White House calls them. 
And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution, we need to not just take our hands in in new ways, we also need to take our eyes in in new ways. 
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it. 
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous. 
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems. 
Gustavo Dudamel! 
We bought one military and we operated another. 
It foamed, and horrible things were happening to me. 
Here he's seen taking a bath at the well, pouring big buckets of water over his head, and the wonderful news is, as you and I are sitting here talking today, Kofi has been reunited with his family, and what's even better, his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe. 
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you." 
And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens. 
But we cannot stop now. 
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. 
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. 
RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works. 
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities. 
Some people gained weight, some people didn't gain weight. 
It was Mairead's sister. 
This one is more than 400 years old. 
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people. 
(Laughter) So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?" 
And there's two things that are really evident here to me, is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up. 
Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan -- it's on Hunter's Point. 
It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have. 
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one, interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one, to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one. 
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate. 
The oil is not liquid. 
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day, not a hard sell to the American population. 
That was enough of citizen media. 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. 
And it gives me a lot of hope. 
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. 
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems -- so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures. 
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School. 
Now, it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. 
I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over, that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. 
The last "A" is Authenticity. 
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor. 
You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station. 
Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse. 
But for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist. 
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will fight them with their own confusion. 
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here. 
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah. 
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours." 
We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions. 
But I managed to do it. 
Now, we started working together 18 months ago. 
Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real? 
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center, and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. 
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over. 
That would tell me something more substantial about you. 
We've operated over 400 of these, perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries -- not just magnesium and antimony. 
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East? 
And finally, we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes. 
But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody, not just on the disgruntled person. 
The fact is that it does not scale. 
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner. 
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security. 
It all started back in 1977. 
So this is another way to see this. 
So, we decided to make things that would look like that. 
And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes. 
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era, post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb, in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers. 
Why mountain rescue? 
No off season, these guys are always active. 
It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror. 
It's called the World Church of God. 
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve. 
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk, even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. 
And I can show here a very good example. 
The light blue line is how much the government gets in. 
We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs, the foot, and some features clearly showed that she walked upright, and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity. 
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. 
If we could do that, I think we would take our first step to an energy plan. 
And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. 
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course, and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope -- measured the speed of light. 
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. 
It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens. 
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. 
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today. 
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. 
The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. 
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. 
I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world." 
Without this ability there is no magic. 
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. 
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt" and the two whales that were killed down here. 
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. 
Although it's closer, I heard this morning, it's closer than I thought it was. 
And you can see, we started making a building together. 
They are dying of sadness." 
This is Natasha's wedding day. 
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say, we've got to fix this problem and we can do it, I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da -- here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that? 
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing. 
In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. 
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box. 
The terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity. 
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world, but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. 
Now, much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings. 
So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up. 
I would love to, but why? 
We called them up at night and asked them, "What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?" 
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. 
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest. 
Like twice over. 
In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody. 
And now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network? (Laughter) Now, you would rather be C. 
"All right. Okay." 
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that, but if you have a million stars, you'll find enough planets. 
Democracy, by the way, means respecting the wisdom of all people -- and we'll get to that. 
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here. 
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops. 
But only in the last 120 years people started, or people knew more and more how to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon, or in fact, natural control phenomenon, to their own needs. 
So we wind time backwards now. 
But when I saw that, I said, "Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region, and some Muslims have been influenced by that. 
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. 
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. 
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually -- I set out to say, is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder? 
Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. 
Then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing. 
My mother's in the kitchen, cooking, and, of all places, in the hallway, I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps. 
You transform it inside as a train car. 
Just shout out anything you see. 
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam, looking at that massive transformation of a landscape. 
We put them all in one index. 
Now, I do it quicker, better. 
Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow, that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue. 
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties. 
What's the capital structure up until this point? 
(Applause) I'm going to talk to you about optimism -- or more precisely, the optimism bias. 
In fact, there is a new theory of autism called the "intense world" theory, which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns. 
And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen, we are like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods. 
People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. 
But you think about other things. 
He knows who's been there, when they were there. 
But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards, and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding" back at the power plant. 
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older. 
And yet, in many places, a third of the children, by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this. 
And though I'm shy of 50, it captures my own experience. 
And here's the point of that. 
And that will have led to specialization. 
And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones. 
There's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune. 
It's all over the Web, Bible Boot Camp. 
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it? 
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process. 
And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing. 
French parents were more likely to say things like, "Noah was here for so little time, but he taught us so much. 
There were blood vessels left. 
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing. 
Some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that. 
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. 
This is so specific that, for example, if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem, if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example, what you get is coma or vegetative state, which is a state, of course, in which your mind disappears, your consciousness disappears. 
In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings. 
He is interested in how we see as an animal, how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage. 
♫ Founding fathers all had slaves. ♫ Sweeney: I know. 
So, now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. 
But then they often wait there. 
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President, addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse, making them feel a part of it. 
And his mouth must be probably about three microns. 
And then another big accident happened in our cricket. 
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening. 
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before. 
What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course. 
Let's call them techno-memes or temes. 
You know, there's this little child who can't see, can't really understand much about the world, has no one in the family who plays an instrument, and yet he taught himself to play that. 
My grandparents, they were in the middle of it. 
It's a little paper chip. 
At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change. 
We did not know what operation to do, where to go in the brain, but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease, we reasoned, why don't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens? 
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology. 
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government, probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. 
For example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way, from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism, or altruism, or religion to practices like dieting behavior, or book purchasing, or drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices, or products that people might buy, purchases of electronic goods, anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread. 
Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. 
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. 
but, to be honest, the description goes on and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however." 
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country. 
Though, for a lot of people, the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. 
Thank you. (Applause) I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. 
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams. 
Now I want to show you one last video. 
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. 
And these viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries. 
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day. 
And it caused me to wonder about our world today. 
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural, beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese. 
Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a 60-page paper based on some age-old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life, which is be an educator, change lives, and spark magic. 
This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. 
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?" 
And it funds a lot of my research. 
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way. 
Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. 
Then do what you have to do." 
Like this green one, this is a painting I did about 10 years ago, but it has some -- see, in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. 
And forward. Yeah. 
I said, "That's good. That's good. 
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot, and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider, what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. 
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost. 
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization. 
because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now, and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California So, we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. 
But right now, you pretty much have to take silicon, put it in an oven at 1600 degrees Fahrenheit for 17 hours, to make the cells. 
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world. 
So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere. 
So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish, we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users. 
In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. 
And this is fun, and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun? 
I love connections. 
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. 
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal. 
It can be done. 
Second Man: It's driving itself. 
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD, and my testimony to the inquiry said three things: that the government exaggerated the intelligence, which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. 
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations, and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa, so that they can make their own choices. 
And what do they do with that money? 
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. 
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. 
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. 
Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. 
So I got inspired by that. 
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts. 
The world is richer, vaster than it too often seems to be. 
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. 
You've probably heard the term "interdependence" applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum. 
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. 
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development -- and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. 
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. 
And I realized then, I wasn't either. 
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users, we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project. 
So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete, or being in a basement -- distance and time is what will save you. 
And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life? 
(Laughter) And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object. 
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there. 
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference. 
AM: Okay, well, Atlanta. 
It really helps you appreciate the good times. 
You learn the next level of knowledge. 
I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children. 
And when you think of the fabric of the brain, the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet? 
Two women together, they have an argument. 
Investment has to be a different beast. 
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA, how you convert it to a form you can sequence. 
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems. 
Next to Japan, it's the second most represented by population. 
How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million. 
BF: Shut up. (Laughter) DH: There's still one more by my foot. 
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside. 
I almost miss it. 
I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue. 
Another case: Last election cycle, I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire, and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons: Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip. 
This is what I mean about appropriate technology. 
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA, and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data, because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable. 
We're so happy to see you, little bottle." 
The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. 
Now that, I suggest, is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. 
If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak, you're probably familiar with it. 
You know, I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. 
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount. 
And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her. 
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them together in the same place. 
(Phone Ringing) I hope that's my agent, because you aren't paying me anything. 
And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. 
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. 
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food. 
So bearing that in mind, as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology: What is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution? 
She was a bright old lady, perfectly sane. She had no medical problems. 
There's a billion people without clean drinking water. 
(Laughter) When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here, it's very strange. 
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that? 
And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month. 
Here's South Africa. The same story. 
Models can come from industry. 
Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? 
Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head. 
Many of you have probably used this. 
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. 
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick. 
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No. 
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen. 
We can do this. 
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. 
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. 
Mummies are a great source of information, except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well. 
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. 
And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment to democracy, open markets and free trade. 
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines, one of whom was cited in the film, and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy, because even at 500 dollars, these drugs were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis. 
These comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folk tales. 
(Laughter) But actually method A is the correct approach. 
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see. 
All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't. 
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. 
It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life. 
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining. 
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures, they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them. 
Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income. 
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. 
It's based on purchasing power parity. 
Institutions are becoming naked, and if you're going to be naked, well, there's some corollaries that flow from that. 
So now we go to Mike McGrew who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland, and Mike's doing miracles with birds. 
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. 
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. 
So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB, one human brain, if we look at the rate that this is increasing, 30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs. 
Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra, but I hate history. 
So from day one, the people involved in the project, bottom left is Fabian Nicieza, writer for X-Men and Power Rangers. 
And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image. 
And I remembered -- I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind. 
And also start with a little bit of statistics. 
Here is that you make these films, it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film, because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed. 
Encourage all our schools to take this seriously. 
That's what she called the "banality of evil." 
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. 
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News," that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages -- English and Spanish. 
But we found that these people in the street, all of them are our reporters, feeding our newsroom with pictures, with videos and with news. 
I said, I also have a pottery. 
FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today to be here, and he is — (Applause) -- He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade in his school in Boston. 
I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph, and then I heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it. 
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K. 
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity. 
So, I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. 
They lack retention; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale. 
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813." 
(Laughter) It could get awkward, right? 
They would dress the robots. 
But what about the conductor? What can you say the conductor was doing, actually? 
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores, because he knew how much she cared. 
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive. 
The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol, was panicked. 
When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002, what I saw was scenes like this. 
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon, it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England, just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat. 
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. 
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world, and then see what the constellations of those might look like. 
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. 
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. 
But I'd like to leave you with just that question: If you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food, what would you do differently? 
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then, I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should, think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets. 
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes. 
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation? 
They loaded up their mules and their horses. 
So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate, I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds. 
Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests. 
And that has a fascination. 
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. 
Will you help be their dad?" 
If you look at the solar system, as we know it today, it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live. 
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. 
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four. 
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply. 
And this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. 
And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. 
It's now coming in this world. 
It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. 
Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah. 
It's long and it's complicated. 
(Laughter) So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. 
Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. 
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. 
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology, or behavior. 
Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes? 
(Laughter) Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it. 
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain. 
It could share information looking down at a screen. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. 
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. 
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. 
In the moment, that's what he did. 
In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy, the number of attacks, of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks, against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold. 
That was my response to the people in the time. 
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject? 
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs? 
And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with, notice, the same basic traditional culture, and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism. 
Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue, or other radiant heat source, goes as you move away from it. 
The state is not a great parent. 
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one. 
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods, and for me the abaya, my traditional dress that I'm wearing today. 
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different, and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world, but if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas. 
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space. 
Through my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. 
Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages. 
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall. 
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth. 
There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked. 
But my personal favorite of these ones, I have to confess, does actually come from the United States: "Officers Taser 86 year-old disabled woman in her bed." 
in Angola or Afghanistan. 
When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? 
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be. 
It's got three centers -- in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney -- and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them. 
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other. 
Please join us by working together. 
Thank you. 
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean? 
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. 
So this looks something like this when it's in the brain. 
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can. 
But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship? 
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea, sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre, but it has nothing to do with the world around us. 
Thank you for listening. 
Even if it takes me four and a half hours, or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it. 
And we sat in silence for that brief moment, and he said to me, "You're really talented." (Laughter) "You're really good. You know, the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist. 
Now, one more time, and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open. 
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?" 
It's wonderful. 
But before we did the first experiments, we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks, the challenges, the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before. 
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone? 
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe, you're talking about 10,000 days of income. 
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities. 
And my mother, brave lady, was partly to blame, taking me to the New York Natural History Museum, buying me books on snakes, and then starting this infamous career of mine, which has culminated in of course, arriving in India 60 years ago, brought by my mother, Doris Norden, and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya. 
There is, at the moment, a stale debate going on very often: state's better, public sector's better, private sector's better, social sector's better, for a lot of these programs. 
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen, and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know, giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress. 
After 11 complete mission failures, we got our first images from space. 
So that's a second, very obvious question: What are the effects of what you're doing? 
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it. 
If you can convince me we can do all that, then, yes, I would take the two percent. 
Yeah. 
And this is accomplished using this kind of device, and this is called deep brain stimulation. 
And my father said, "OK, listen. 
But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship? 
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different. 
So they felt worse. 
It was my first audition, and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position. 
Because brains are expensive. 
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. 
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. 
And once again, they proved themselves. 
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. 
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them. 
I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said, "Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow. 
And this is called the "degree" of a node, or the number of connections that a node has. 
Thank you. 
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean. 
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. 
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice, to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver. 
This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole, he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. 
And often it does something more. 
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. 
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game. 
I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor. 
The team leader was Girish Wagh, a 34 year-old boy in [unclear]. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So where it's happening is in Africa. 
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier. 
So, in closing, on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet. 
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. 
But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google, so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming, but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable. 
So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. 
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem. 
Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy. 
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids. 
And I work a lot in what I call "retrofuturism," which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow. 
(Laughter) And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again. 
In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there. 
There needed to be a foundation in place. 
After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing, and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. 
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one. 
(Applause) And I have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom. 
As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time, if you assume that all magnets had to be hard, then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. 
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day. 
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea. 
So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves as points and interact that way. 
So if you're looking at the boat from this side, this might remind you of an airplane profile. 
We can also use cymatics for healing and education. 
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics, especially in this part of the world. 
So therefore, if we were to do this, what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same, this indicates that that site is important for a function, so a disease mutation should fall within that site. 
Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit. 
Now, this thing has a function. 
Now, what's great about it is that people are working on -- within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. 
The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair. 
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes, but instead because when there's flooding, occasionally the colony has to go down deep. 
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game, and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances, cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time. 
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have. 
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately. 
But I believe now that we're moving into a new age, and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as "the age of behavior." 
We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation. 
(Applause) (Music) ♫ Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama, Thula Mama. ♫ ♫ Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory, ♫ ♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫ ♫ I know the truth in your smile, ♫ ♫ piercing through the gloom of my ignorance. ♫ ♫ Oh, there is a mama lying down sleeping ♫ ♫ you're very ill and your heart crying. ♫ ♫ Wondering, wondering, wondering, wondering where is this world coming to. ♫ ♫ Is it right the children have to fend for themselves? No, no, no, no, no. no. ♫ 
We want to be healthy and live a full life. 
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. 
So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need? 
(Laughter) But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things. 
The American people, taken as a whole, when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues, are moderate, pragmatic centrists. 
Why do we need to study this anymore? 
Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?" 
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren't going to take off. 
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this. 
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. 
And each of these centers has a strong local team, each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place, which international lecturers will be happy to visit. 
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth. 
And you can make that change. 
It's what we're supposed to do somehow. 
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. 
And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record. 
Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. 
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science. 
Now, on the video, on the video here, I'm going to show you exactly the same thing, except that what I'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet. 
You have to convey the actual content -- here we get back to the container metaphor. 
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results. 
It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem. 
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. 
So all these little PDAs and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa. 
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. 
I get stuck in traffic -- evil, evil traffic. 
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, "Aww." Right? 
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia, zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life. 
And we already see signs of organization going on here. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. Shukran. (Applause) For me, this story begins about 15 years ago, when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago. 
So I went through the very legal process, because at the end of the day, the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not, and that's how I got in there. 
He said, "Don't all those little tweets, don't all those little sips of online communication, add up to one big gulp of real conversation?" 
Now David is my literary agent. 
And do not get the impression that this is very subjective. 
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof. 
That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world. 
They look like the stuff we walk around with. 
So, what does a plant need in order to grow? 
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft. 
In fact, our humanity, and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we've invented. 
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?" 
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful, art comes with responsibility. 
I like it as a component of global change to talk about, because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic, and I talk to that community fairly often, you cannot deny the simple physics of CO2 dissolving in the ocean. 
In other words, men and women were worshiping all together. 
One of them is to think without pressure. 
And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here, there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here -- I tried to make a relationship urbanistically. 
And if you look at things like the iPhone app, the fraction is considerably larger. 
Okay, so how would I like to finish? 
Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning, because now it was about communication, a communication where words failed, a communication of a message that went deeper than words, that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche, yet came as a true musical offering from me. 
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. 
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India. 
Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English. 
I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. 
And not only is mobile the gold of today, I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. 
The blue line is the number of cyclists, soaring. 
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. 
Well, the foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat. 
And eventually, I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo, which was then under U.N. administration. 
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already. 
And the Philistine who is sent down, their mighty warrior, is a giant. 
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened. 
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, who was one of the greatest graphic designers, and also a great writer as well. 
In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. 
She says, "I bought a present for my mom. 
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities, go out and design them. 
Adjusted for population density, that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. 
We believe this is one. 
Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. 
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. 
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. It's very good. 
It's actually part of a very long story, a great story, that began billions of years ago. 
Because they evolved for the same reason: to survive predation. 
One is, remember I'm a politician, so you've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea. 
He had to sit on a cushion, stand still, not move, because it was very painful. 
RM: Yeah. I, every time you think you've chased something down, it's funny, no matter how good you are, and I know guys like this, it feels like you're polishing a turd. 
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever, and knowing a good thing when it sees it, the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us. 
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people, that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well? 
There's musical labels. 
(Video) (Crowd Noise) And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design. 
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity, those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent. 
We need to learn to speak the body's language. 
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this, it cost a lot, didn't it? 
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. 
Some are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics. 
Thank you. 
And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things. 
We can open up city hall. 
Everest is an extreme environment. 
We have corporates that have stood behind us, and we are able to, now, open more schools. 
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds. 
(Laughter) But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people, for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg, at the University of Stanford, makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies." 
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. 
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. 
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data. 
We went back to our hotel room, and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was. 
(Laughter) What a handsome cat. 
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one. 
And the poem goes: "On the idle hill of summer, lazy with the flow of streams, hark I hear a distant drummer, drumming like a sound in dreams, far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by, dear to friend and food to powder, soldiers marching, soon to die." 
I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. 
This is what one second looks like. 
Now I'm a science reporter. 
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. 
"I already have," she told me. 
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction. 
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now. 
Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing, but this analysis some of you may have seen. 
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. 
So the truckers are just going about their business, and they're buying fuel. 
Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it? 
Dance has never had a better friend than technology. 
And everybody's happy about that. 
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters. 
And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic is about digital privacy. 
When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl.

But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently, and it's become the foundation of my work because, I feel like, if in a day, I can see the ocean differently, then I can evoke that same kind of change in others, especially kids. 
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective. 
fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine, and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon. 
Because we were in the age before anesthesia, the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself.

The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable? 
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey, but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students, have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing. 
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry, and the service it provides is awareness.

Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it. 
(Laughter) Do you -- Do you see any Canine teeth? 
It's kind of a forward osmosis. 
This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased, and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor.

That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone. 
But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep? 
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. 
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. 
Quite consciously, design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques, just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. 
Allow many people to come in. 
Poor people also suffer at the point of use. 
It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man, and it came from magical thinking. 
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning. 
And this one in the middle here, the large truck, is actually called the Active Denial System -- something the U.S. military is working on at the moment. 
Does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside Africa and inside Africa in that people outside Africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans, whereas Africans do not?

The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields. 
So you're never going to see them on a billboard. 
Incredibly, this nation, with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources, seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas. 
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence, not just an individual existence. 
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century, and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun.

Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. 
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true, there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you.

Now, what is game theory about? 
I'd like to begin with my very first object, which I call "The Uncle Phone."

Now I'll close with regenerative medicine. 
Was I what had been done to me? 
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition, are having a difficult time, diplomatically. 
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. 
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control. 
They don't have any carbon content. 
The classic example is pollution. 
This comes out repeatedly, again, again, again. 
And you can see the start of it here. 
It's because, well, thousands of years ago, people invented ideas -- they had ideas, innovations, technology -- and the Stone Age ended, not because we ran out of stones. 
Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole.

The idea being passed on through proselytizing, instead of through the gene line. 
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. 
It will be the size of a single, small atom.

And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction. 
We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage. 
Part of the income for his farm. 
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them. 
And it was my theory, or my point of view, that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations. 
two out of three ate the marshmallow. 
So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light. 
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.

Well, most of you anyway. 
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. 
So, my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. 
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on, literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece -- was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. 
And so this is not a video. 
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo. 
The last one is organization and support. 
But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. 
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data. 
In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. 
I've talked about some of the challenges, let me talk about some of the solutions, and there are predictable solutions. 
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months. 
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000. 
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.

It means that you have to save more today. 
But you know what? 
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. 
Those kinds of loose analogies with (Laughter) computers, and with programming, are actually much deeper than that. 
So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group. 
And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thanks. 
(Laughter) SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel. 
No, you haven't. Why not? 
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit. 
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch. 
There's some large companies that have seen this vision, that are doing large-scale digitization, but they're locking up the public domain. 
(Laughter) Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. 
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges. 
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about. 
In fact, it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. 
The first one is that in life we encounter many people who, in some way or another, try to tattoo our faces. 
And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes. 
And this allows something very special to happen in games. 
I'm going to talk all about that. 
So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward. 
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives, mortgage-backed securities. 
Here's a wonderful fractal. 
Because they already know what she looks like. 
We connect the dots in the supply chain. 
They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way. 
But more important, the pan-African student body is a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa. 
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. 
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how? 
We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step. 
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. 
Short shadows at noon and so forth. 
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing, because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. 
(Laughter) And so, what do you know, that drug was approved. 
We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. 
Then the gymnosophist asked, "What are you doing?" 
I can take you back. 
Yeah, I -- as you would expect -- get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest. 
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. 
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect. 
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in, but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in won't interest many other people. 
Also the noise will disappear in these pores. 
The first is Bharti Kher. 
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear]. 
They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences. 
But there it is. The gay agenda. 
and working with NGOs and building this case. 
Isaiah Berlin put it this way: "Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable." 
Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit. 
And how did we do all this? 
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this. 
Yet they do that. 
And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans -- and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... 
You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example, and they could give you an antiserum, an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus, if the intern sub-typed it correctly. 
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. 
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world. 
Not like hot water made cold, or cold water turned hot, but water boiled off and becoming steam. 
It can't be because of play. 
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem, or they can choose to ignore them, but these -- you don't have warring factions, and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made Italy so innovative and so tolerant. 
And that's quite a thought. 
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins. 
Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected, there's no one for them to infect. 
For this fish, it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes. 
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. 
I just wanted a blessing, I didn't want some kind of mandate. 
This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, for which humans have no natural immunity. 
This is a typical angora embroidery for them. 
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden. 
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now. 
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. 
In fact, most of the time I don't see it. 
I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life. 
But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision. 
My son still had his dad. 
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious. 
They've never been dived." 
And Dick and Harry repeat this. 
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments. 
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects, but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses. 
But the question is, "Who will have it?" 
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. 
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. 
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. 
He painted a beautiful Vermeer. 
Do you know why they do this? 
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez, a libertarian who works at the, for many people, "evil" Cato Institute. 
Here we are on October the 19th. 
So here he is beginning. 
KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. 
And it really informs my painting. 
In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me, when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria. 
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. 
And once again, two scientists have got a problem with noise. 
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. 
Eighty kilowatt-hours. Can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles I just listed? 
Imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old. 
But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. 
In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. 
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers, parents, performers -- to be explorers together. 
It's not interesting because it's so common. 
The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire. 
This is what it looks like today. 
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it. 
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear. 
Now over the last century, in developed nations like America, moral debate has escalated because we take the hypothetical seriously, and we also take universals seriously and look for logical connections. 
or "What kind of medium do you work in?" 
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much; you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something. 
I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation, but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days? 
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. 
Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic, it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard. 
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do, and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed, and errors in estimating the value of their own success. 
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is. 
We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay? 
There are no guns going off. 
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice, dominating the visual and mental environment. 
Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing, and some winning. 
So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high. 
He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai. 
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen. 
(Laughter) Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States. 
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time? 
And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. 
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore -- we hire people to look at websites and tell you -- if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers, each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output, 
What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers? 
At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter. 
So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it. 
That's the kind of specificity you need. 
Where did they get that inspiration? 
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out. 
And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas. 
If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. 
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet, there's very little red anywhere. 
Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that. 
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook. 
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. 
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like. 
In about two to three hours, she started to move. 
So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we're designing -- my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work -- it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's. 
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front. 
And those are the questions that inspired my new project, which is debuting here today at TED. 
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood. 
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure. 
A few days later, we received a call: "Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction?" 
And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults. 
Newton certainly believed that. 
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. 
He tasted it and fell in love with it. 
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. 
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion. 
Perfect, excellent. 
(Applause) ♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫ ♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫ ♫ We're taking phone calls from the dead. ♫ ♫ They're calling from beyond the grave. ♫ ♫ Beyond the grave. ♫ ♫ They have some questions ♫ ♫ And things to share ♫ ♫ From underneath the cold, cold ground. ♫ We're soliciting phone calls from dead people as a special TED presentation. 
Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand." 
They were together while doing the tawaf, the circular walk around the Kaaba. 
The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. 
(Laughter) Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest. 
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. 
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic, there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords. 
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy. 
But not too much. 
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations, but are too scared to mention them. 
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing. 
I was a young driver out on the highway, and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on. 
And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe. 
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation. 
It's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species, but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected. 
And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling, is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell. 
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? 
What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. 
And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water. 
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?" 
(Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do. 
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. 
And, on the left, Riley. 
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100. 
This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway, everything has to happen in lockstep -- whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. 
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles. 
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect, many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. 
First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky, if you're telling time at night. 
I see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow. 
Robert Dill-Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion. 
It's easier to handle. It's something that we understand really well. 
I have no interest in that whatsoever. 
They were just beyond our sights. 
But densification is not going to work everywhere. 
The parents were looking in the window. 
So they tell you where it is, what the prices are, the address, the phone number, etc. 
It is the place where we're learning the most. 
And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up. 
And at about four months old, I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss. 
You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at, or try and boil it down to just four, but you'll lose. 
There's one in the skull, and then just for good measure, I had these other tumors -- including, by the time my treatment started, one was growing out of my tongue. 
And lastly, what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector and the African as an individual? 
Bright yellow. 
And all I can say about this is: Why are we fighting it? 
To me, that’s the real natural wonder. 
And what goes on in the future? 
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left -- (Laughter) with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto. 
We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. 
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. 
I think even NASA can do that, and they proved that they can. (Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 
Her cancer continued to grow. 
We don't tell you all the grubby details. 
That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot, send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country. 
This is the complete structure of the airplane. 
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?" 
Fit into this other system and try to become a student." 
First one is the political system. 
Then, one night, the scene changes. 
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease. 
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. 
But that's a slightly different story, which I won't go into now. 
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. 
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now? 
So let me show you how this works. 
The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. 
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust. 
They had some number of big successes. 
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web, and we're all visualizers now; we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. 
And Alice was unusual partly because, of course, she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s. 
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. 
Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose, but you should choose wisely, because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk. 
Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks. 
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. 
And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. 
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. 
Instead of blank stares and awkwardness, now it is pointing and smiling! 
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern, that will be very, very cool. 
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. 
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know? 
She says the airports of the world. 
But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd. 
And it's even cruel to think of anything like this. 
Down below, highlighted in red, in the other section of source code, is this bit "leded:leded." 
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick." 
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. 
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. 
Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. 
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow. 
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning, for just a quick video. 
Suddenly and for the very first time, collective defense, the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations, is no longer enough. 
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school. 
Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works, pushing what matter can do, the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium, and any sufficiently complicated task, whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child -- anything that's complicated -- comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it, and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say, "Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this. 
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week. 
Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging. 
They see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from. 
OK. This is a bit of a problem. 
There was gas rationing in 1973. 
He's about to head home, and look what happens. 
Someone's love, someone's baby. 
This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some 14.7 billion years ago. 
It was just fantastic. 
Amphetamines. 
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust. 
It's riddled with gimmicks." 
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED. 
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs -- I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on -- change them after this -- or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not -- but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. 
In essence, could we "app" chemistry? 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan. 
Social activists, business leaders, lawyers, politicians, professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good. 
They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. 
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that. 
In the modern day world, where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough, the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. 
The project launched in April 2005. 
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox, a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us? 
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes? 
Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25. 
But during the time that I was photographing this, I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda. 
There is a very important issue here, which is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors. That's what color printers do. 
The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither?" 
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition. 
How do we get her into the studio? 
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. 
(Laughter) I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. 
In another generation down the line, I think we will have succeeded. 
And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year, and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. 
The last step, of course, is application. 
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago, to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother, she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human. 
It was intuitive. 
Or perhaps, Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man. 
But it has to have political leadership. 
It doesn't really work in this context. 
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week, or the Mexican G20, also last week. 
They're not very well designed, right? 
Joey boy, you there? 
So, I went. 
But after that, I actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department, and I wasn't doing any neuroscience. 
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal. 
But there are companies. 
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father, my relatives, my friends and my homeland. 
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so. 
I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition: I call them preposterous. 
And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network. 
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way, to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. 
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen, by talking to victims, by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services. 
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. 
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience. 
Have sex again. 
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down. 
And that was torture, real torture. 
It was a nurturing, loving environment, where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood, because they were going through it too. 
Rodney Mullen: That's a good question. 
Believe it or not, some of us do survive. 
And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days, Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey, I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call "Humanity 2.0." 
How many digits are there in your number? 
ES: Thank you very much. 
Ready? Black. 
It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. 
And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. 
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. 
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have, the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them, to gather them to make this happen. 
So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. 
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. 
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. 
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. 
So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge. 
But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness, these webs that can be these channels for compassion. 
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy. 
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do. 
My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars, actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. 
SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs. 
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. 
"What?" I said, "Stop." 
Six months after that, with no explanation, they let me go. 
(Laughter) And I will spare you that slide. 
If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers, our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. 
Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus, that there was intense microwave radiation. 
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?" 
My head was cut open across the front, lifted back, exposing the skull underneath. 
And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries. 
What about other countries? 
And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force. 
(Applause) Compassion: what does it look like? 
It's a universal thing -- we play. 
And one idea I want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food? 
We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics. 
My name's Willie Brown." 
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness. 
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology: you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in. 
That's my wish. 
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan, and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend, we don't care, spend some more, and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending. 
I decided I wanted to make a star. 
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. 
And so computers, as you know, these big computers, there are now tiny computers. 
And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless, countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this. 
Try it! 
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery? 
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. 
Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher. 
What's in this picture? 
Please, allow me just two minutes. 
But you know what you're not entitled to? 
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. 
So, every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing, actually, was funding the IRA. 
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car, you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works. 
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice! 
There's lots of virtues of copying.

And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down. 
I like this guy, yeah. 
(Laughter) And I was like, "Yeah, Ray. 
Try this quick thought experiment. 
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as -- you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake, right, because you can see behind the facade, right? 
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga. 
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. 
One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall, I lay in bed and looked at her, and I suddenly thought, I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that. 
It's all about the individuals. 
Once more, humility, limits, honesty, realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. 
It was a tough decision. I loved university. 
But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. 
I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy -- who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month. 
Then it's "for," with the light on. 
Other people make the opposite trip. 
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life. 
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here." 
Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer -- to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body -- is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD." 
(Applause) We invent. 
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns, there's something beautiful looking back at you, that's deliberate. 
(Applause) Good afternoon. 
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer. 
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets, will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. 
They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. 
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types. 
Fortunately, we've been able to convince Congress. 
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people, not just a few people. 
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too! 
So here we are. 
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga? 
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. 
So, what do they do? 
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. 
"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror." 
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts, the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do. 
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. 
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow. 
It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type. 
I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. 
Now why. 
Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory, by chance. 
He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. 
Chance favors the connected mind. 
'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born. 
They would actually cover the windows every night, so that light couldn't be seen, because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time. 
This guy thought in the same way I did. 
And now that he published this work, others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements. 
Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent. 
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app. 
What do we do now? 
Actually any primate will do that. 
The first thing I learned -- well, I'm mortal, that's a really big one. 
And you then ask the question: Why is the water hot? 
I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees. 
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space, just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. 
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good. 
But we’re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. 
(Laughter) And he killed himself soon afterwards. 
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. 
How wide would the verge have to be for that to work out? 
And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts, to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. 
I met her last October in India, and she grew up in a conservative environment. 
And to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy. 
I got a scholarship, went to university, studied international agriculture, studied anthropology, and decided I was going to give back. 
And they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps for each little bleep that they record. 
And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa -- inventive kids, intellectual kids -- and starved of opportunity. 
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search, and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit. 
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena. 
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future. 
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. 
These are among the world's most admired, most beloved, most innovative companies. 
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration, I think this is the new zeitgeist: open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long. 
They're smaller questions, but they are not that small. 
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too. 
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal? 
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. 
I spent two years there writing on oil spills. 
He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India, and after discovering this information, the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai. 
(Laughter) Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically? 
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. 
And I heard him, I heard all the words. 
And it could join into the relationship with you. 
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. 
Why? Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read. 
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see, that certainly wasn't always the case. 
Here is something of the way they live. 
But then we had to learn how to make them. 
And this is one of those examples of the sets. 
Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S&amp;M way. 
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. 
It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. 
And Ghana was not paying enough attention. 
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening. 
I remember my teacher. When I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go. 
And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it. 
We need to begin to work with industries. 
Let's see. 
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement? 
She's now running around with her kids. 
Privacy is not up for discussion. 
Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market? 
But most of all, the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. 
He went to a local hospital and there they said, "Ran, there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers. 
And so one of the consequences of that, I believe, is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform. 
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are? 
CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward. 
Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. 
In total, I found 185 products. 
So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities, of which the buildings are a part. 
So it turned into a dual celebration, because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States. 
And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake. 
But the men had a better idea. 
We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. 
But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino -- free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world. 
It is sad, but it is what it is. 
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. 
I ducked. 
Many years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain, and I was, at that stage, working in America. 
(Laughter) And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. 
It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is, you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz, another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz, and so you can run this system in broad daylight. 
It's real. 
A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. 
We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't, but now we have them. 
So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15. 
So there's been many studies, including this one, that show that if you use active learning, interacting with your students in the classroom, performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance, on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test. 
This frustrated and confused me; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do, and I was excited to do, but no matter what I would do, I would fail. 
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form. 
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind, which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. 
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. 
I grew up with a radio in a car. 
There are many things that we can do to get us there. 
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that? 
The sound that you're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms. 
Mexico has cancer. 
I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during 9/11, and it was obviously a very relevant thing. 
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter. 
(Applause) The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer. 
In these partnerships, I have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists, but when we share nature, when we share our perspectives about nature, we find a common denominator. 
And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents -- and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father. 
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. 
He pointed at the algae. 
This is not what I expected, trust me. 
But what if they were poems and psalms? 
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade. 
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. 
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand. 
So we actually tried to commission some crash tests. 
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. 
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before. 
So let's take a closer look at rule number 30 here. 
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out. 
You have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis, a feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth. 
And the laws reflect these attitudes. 
(Laughter) But once in a while you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. 
So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes. 
This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with; this is a different definition of health, health that has a great advantage because it's external, it's shared, we can do something about it, as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined or individualized. 
(Applause). 
And that is what is going to happen in the future. 
A group of hunters approach, their packs loaded with wild game. 
Okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. 
When are you going to do the next one? We just can't wait to follow the next one." 
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character. 
They start polishing it with a stone for hours. 
And during harvest, put it back with interest, food interest. 
And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story. 
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. 
Rick Smolan: I'm sure there's about 40 things she's going to tell me, "That wasn't what happened, that wasn't what you said." 
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. 
Without them, we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. 
Show us some primary cancer. 
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body and how they hear and sense. 
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. 
(Laughter) And number two, do not build a reformer on the ocean. 
So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. 
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet. 
The pithiest answer to the question "why?" 
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants. 
What does this compassion entail? 
Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star, maybe in a another galaxy, there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are, and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots. 
Now I have beaten a song back into you. 
It's really, really important that we express our compassion. 
These are more people working for this group. 
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. 
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network, can see that they occupy very different social worlds. 
Here's an example of the men and the height. 
Ultimately, the goal, once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making, we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future. 
Well, what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets, the coverage rate really falls down a lot. 
If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George, when he decides on where he wants to live -- is it Florida or North Dakota? -- he goes and lives in Georgia. 
The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley. 
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race. 
Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment. 
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness. 
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean, I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right? 
They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. 
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids." 
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. 
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. 
Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch. 
So traditionally, the computer labs, particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County, where they have to benchmark test every other week, the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility. 
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then. 
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and very high-dose Methotrexate. 
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations. 
So you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. 
Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. 
(Laughter) He said, "You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray." 
We're facing very tough challenges. 
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me? 
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people. 
He was a soft dictator of Kenya. 
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor. 
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban, and they did it. 
Here we have "Day and Night." 
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half. 
The Transition gives you a safer, more convenient and more fun way of using this resource. 
I'll be honest with you: we're into it because of business growth opportunities. 
Shortly after, my parents got separated, and I came to Turkey with my mom. 
Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it Data from "Star Trek," but to take a human and make her more capable. 
The key thing is that for it to work, there has to be interpersonal influence. 
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. 
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes, aromatic plants and so on. 
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy. 
Well actually, I was not silly. 
It gives you an image for every page of the book. 
Zero, not a single one. 
In the ocean, it's the rule rather than the exception. 
The secular world is full of holes. 
And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear], and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. 
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails. 
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is. 
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens, it will transform our view of life altogether. 
Let me tell you a secret. 
This is the first temporary building made out of paper. 
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out? 
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?" 
If you do this, the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist. 
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet. 
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to, and by studying, the collective. 
I knew the journey would be risky, but I would be risking my life either way. 
We place it back into this oven-like device. 
Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. 
And then about a year and a half ago, Google actually acquired this company. 
For us, it's a problem, the people in this room. 
They listen to his metaphors and analogies, and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. 
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months, who was going to graduate from high school, based on who had good attachment with mom. 
Warren: I am not a golfer. 
How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost? How do you do it? 
Thank you so much. 
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids, but there is no life. 
And for the next three years, her fate will be having sex with him every day, as a favor for getting her in school. 
And when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages. 
Now, of the women that could tell them apart, when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable," and when the labels were on, they picked "Ballet Slippers." 
And as I was doing it, what happened? 
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined. 
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards? 
Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause) There are 1,400 stars. 
What happened? 
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant. 
And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women -- who don't have access to nature, who often have a lot of time, they often have space, and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses -- would be great partners. 
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. 
It shoots up and it keeps going up. 
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up. 
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. 
We want to work with you." 
In a recent study, the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. 
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero. 
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen? 
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up. 
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources. 
So you see, the liquid metal battery story is more than an account of inventing technology, it's a blueprint for inventing inventors, full-spectrum. 
When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio. 
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt? 
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things, you're going mad, but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different. 
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry. 
I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. 
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. 
(Laughter) Then my pop got on there. 
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. 
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner." 
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. 
And specifically, it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively. 
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other, are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged. 
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina" and its famous opening sentence, "All happy families are alike. 
Let me try and tell you -- I don’t mean to insult you, but look, if I -- and I’m not doing this for real because it would be an insult, so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow -- I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking. 
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. 
We need military presence, but we need to move to politics. 
He's the only African who's contributing to this. 
But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. 
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. 
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall. 
And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form. 
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced. 
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season. 
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town, but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site of the destruction. 
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want to take you back to the United States of America, just after they'd achieved independence. 
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school, and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?" 
And I said, "Well, I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on." 
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap in the Village, that my neighbor was her. 
(Applause) I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design; I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. 
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. 
And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years, and in disadvantaged populations, the populations that don't have access to clinical services, rural populations, minorities, the age of diagnosis is later still, which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe. 
There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit. 
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true. 
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. 
I mean, it's just a losing proposition. 
This is the last frontier of recycling. 
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. 
Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall. 
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people "Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?" 
It's a tawa. 
And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. 
The question was, where from? 
Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. 
I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. 
It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance. 
And this is a hundred-year-old toy. 
But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff. 
It can run the same speed without even that segment. 
But her suffering is equal to mine. 
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. 
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose. 
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser. 
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. 
Prisoners are still born into prisoner-of-war camps long after the guards are gone. 
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains. 
There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. 
This is a place, in a way, that I just would like you to, in a way, look at differently because of this event that has happened in it, a human event, and in general, it just asks us to look again at this world, so different from, in a way, the world that we have been sharing with each other, the technological world, to look again at the elemental world. 
Absolutely boggles my mind. 
And the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile. 
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change -- and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change. 
So for example, take the Jewish idea of forgiveness. 
When we get bigger distance from cheating, from the object of money, for example, people cheat more. 
(Applause) (Music) I'd like to thank everybody, all the scientists, the philosophers, the architects, the inventors, the biologists, the botanists, the artists ... 
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. 
Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict? 
And then you might get something. 
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day." 
But of course, I could never say anything, because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family. 
But my story is huge. 
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. 
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person. 
And so the rest of the site was a public space. 
Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying. 
Something else you see that you talk about -- Americans don't talk about this, but you do. 
That's a lot of particles to keep track of. 
So, this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. 
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen, but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you. 
I mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work. 
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. 
So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity. 
The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world, awe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral. 
And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. 
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. 
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. 
Now, there's work to do. 
And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness. 
Think about what you might pick. 
He didn't know. 
So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer. 
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog." 
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it. 
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name. 
This collagen is the stuff between cells. 
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?" 
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. 
And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too. 
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go. 
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design, they click "Enter" and this data gets converted into the data that a 3D printer reads and gets passed to a 3D printer, perhaps on someone's desktop. 
If it has this sublinear scaling, the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth. 
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors. 
Now, are there downsides to that? 
You might be a vengeful god and going out and conquesting, because you actually can do that, you can go in and attack other intelligent races. 
So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here. 
But they were not two characters on two different adventures. 
And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane, but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild. 
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit, but don't shop like that any other day. 
If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass, that's an eight A "aaaaaaaargh." 
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. 
I mean, it just gives you the scale. 
So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. 
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn; he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off? 
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly. 
That's bad news for the polar bears. 
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago. 
So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States, never to come back. 
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. 
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. 
The first is this: We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives, if you give people more choice, if you put them in the driving seat, then actually, you can create a stronger and better society. 
I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories. 
Together we can make our beds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. 
What happens? They give better service -- not worse, but better. 
The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment. 
And basically, our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes, two sources of energy, one of which is solar, that drives the winds, the waves, the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis. 
We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou, and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers. 
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. 
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory, the RAM and the ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit. 
Let's start with aviation. 
And finally, out of desperation, I said, "Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877." 
It's not that I didn't have help, but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader. 
Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge. 
So really, just an amazing image, slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds. 
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known, I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats, and why not -- a toothbrush? 
And this idea is actually nothing new. 
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this, you had to share packets of information. 
(Applause) "People do stupid things. 
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. 
And actually we don't spend nearly enough money looking for those things, looking for those tiny things that may or may not work, but which, if they do work, can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense, their efforts and the disruption they cause. 
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. 
Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane. 
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there. 
There's a disincentive to conserve, because, if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right. 
All of us are makers. 
Or to put it slightly differently: one apple feeds one man, but an idea can feed the world. 
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated. 
One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children. 
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work, at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem, which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company? 
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two, and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices. 
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different. 
And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove, so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting, which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think, where did you come from? 
And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. 
(Laughter) And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. 
And my time is up, and thank you for your time. 
Of course, the cage was salvaged. 
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia. 
I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition. 
This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust. 
All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers, and maintain our source, maintain our rivers. 
The clubs were escaping me at each throw. 
Cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products, and he's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products. 
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain. 
Well, this has deep implications about the limits of science, about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies, about intelligence in the universe, about questions like free will and about creating technology. 
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links. 
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..." 
So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of. 
He fled Germany, together with his family, leaving everything else behind. 
So, it's been a big, very complex project, which I was not sure was going to work at all. 
JE: And in theory, that means that, as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches, you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. 
And we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children. 
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there. 
(Laughter) I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter) (Audience: Ewww.) Okay, turn back, if you didn't look. 
But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war. 
So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too -- the modifications to the car and the wheel. 
Add those up. That is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly. 
And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring, and to try and do something about it. 
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed, that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun, a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together, and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets, So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale, so it's like a test bed for it. 
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood, as we should, that they must respect minority rights, if we don't accept majority rights? 
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country? 
Now, here's the story. 
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. 
It may change this century. 
So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there, and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give a fragrance, and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances. 
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print, and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. 
I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google -- Larry and Sergey -- people who have helped build the Web as it is, and I'm grateful for that. 
And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that. 
After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. 
And so they put this together, a list of all the species, where they're known to occur, and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise. 
The city was there. 
But interestingly, Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. 
My parents are closing in on 80. 
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. 
She was mesmerized. 
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much. 
It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty. 
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room. 
So here you have a system, you have something -- and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology -- some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump, and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen, OK? 
How many people does he employ to service that population? 
And I learned -- in fact, I confirmed -- the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant, and then they start mixing. 
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap. 
And he said, "You know, I'm the lucky guy at this table. 
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. 
It's old school al Qaeda. 
And on the surface of a sphere, a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw. 
So we can actually use biomaterials now. 
This individual has parainfluenza-1, and you can see that there's a little stripe over here for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza. 
The self: you are self-aware. 
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. 
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. 
This was more or less known. 
And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast. 
But you've never seen this one before. 
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website -- you can just look at the raw data, and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. 
But I want to be clear, just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. 
My sister and I grew up here, and we had quiet, happy childhoods. 
In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from smallpox: more than all the wars in history, more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world. 
Law is a human institution; responsibility is a human institution. 
And I can imagine, if we do this, the headlines in 10 years might read something like these: "New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero," "U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" -- (Applause) -- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence." 
For example ... 
So that we actually, to test this idea, first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids. 
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us. 
What we want to do is spin that around. 
And you see that this work was done in 2006. 
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain. 
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. 
And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children. 
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. 
There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. 
If you look carefully, you can even see a hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left, where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical. 
But if they really were intelligent, why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel? 
We've scanned about 200,000 books. 
Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry, or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake? 
Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature? 
Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over. 
Agritourism, going to vineyards and going to farms. 
It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness. 
And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this. 
It's a problem across the developing world, and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica, for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament, you meet them, and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton, and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston, and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle-income country in the world: a dismal, depressing landscape of burnt and half-abandoned buildings. 
And he made this statement that was so profound to me. 
So over the last several years, kids around the world ages 8 and up, have shared their projects, and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects, whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. 
Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. 
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can. 
They want to be part of it. 
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain. 
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps, and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation, because I really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels: the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level, the political or ethical level. 
(Applause) A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it. 
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now. 
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design. 
[Have you ever cheated in an exam?] Now to one group of subjects, we told them, "Only other students will see your answers." 
And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED, I see we're even closer than I thought we were before. 
And the same idea now can be built up. 
But the days of cheap oil are over. 
It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women. 
Older people have that experience. 
So the real question then is: How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV? 
Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain, and in fact not surprisingly, the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. 
In case you're finished with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter) So it's very useful. 
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006. 
But immediately the system goes like, "What kind of dumb piece of code was this? 
Well, to cut a long story short, they're actually flying right across the ocean. 
Now, the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected. 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. 
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells, and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. 
This is the way our centers are set up. 
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. 
I hope that's your goal. 
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking, and he drinks a lot. (Laughter) And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical: he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure. 
What a fish. 
(Applause) I love trees, and I'm very lucky, because we live near a wonderful arboretum, and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife and now, with my four-year-old, and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek. 
I just showed you this picture. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? 
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?" 
My father, who is 92, likes to say, "Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all." 
And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots. 
Now although the root word is about people, I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. 
(Laughter) And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers, and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers, to those around us. 
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. 
This is age versus cost of health care. 
The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people, serves the interests of the people, and represents the people. 
So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. 
He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink. 
And all I've got is a box of slides." 
You cleaned up my room. 
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months. 
It's not nearly as important as health. 
And nobody knew anything about it. 
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. 
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail, people with high expectations always feel better. 
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator, and he was convicted. 
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. 
A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. 
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. 
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there, and there they are: the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. 
We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question. 
And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. 
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach, and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. 
I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. 
It's not a free gift. 
(Applause) I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain. 
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. 
In fact, [unclear] still says this today. 
Tremendously challenging. 
And they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design, you can reduce that noise by 90 percent. 
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States. 
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony. 
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right? 
Now South African friends will know that was very painful. 
But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us. 
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with. 
What we see, in all these cases, bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them. 
Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas. 
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes, it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history, it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize, but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain, which is comparable for a fruit fly, it is the size of a salt grain. 
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. 
And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes. 
The great poem of John Donne's. 
This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe, and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. 
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. 
There are people in the States right now tying themselves into knots, trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists. 
And I'd pull her out on the front porch. 
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. 
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas, which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. 
Because, at the end of the day, it could, if necessary by force, get its own way. 
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm, for fishes and green. 
We need to process what's going on the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later, not a week later, at the moment. 
Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition, spending between one to 25 million dollars each. 
But the way the symmetries interact enable us -- we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. 
And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. 
It comes from popular culture. 
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. 
And his tags popped off in the Caribbean and even in Brazil. 
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life, the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality, the place where anger was an expression in the search for love, a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth. 
If you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions, you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis, in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic -- as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them. 
Now, the previous speaker before me, Idris Mohammed, indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa. 
They make balloon animals. 
Instead, there was a litany of astonishing optimism. 
He said, "Okay." 
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. 
And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison? 
Because, prior to the 1980s, medical science said that if a woman tried to run 26 miles -- does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles, why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s? 
Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood? That's awful, right? 
So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today. 
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. 
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. 
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe, and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles. 
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language. 
I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct, not a real designer of good equipment. 
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. 
(Applause) So in order for all this to work, obviously I have got to be in a position of trust. 
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually -- are all performing ecological services for one another, such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another. 
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either. 
And he will push us back. 
It's so simple, so dry. 
You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. 
I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings, but they popped up when I least expected it. 
We've made into something beyond us. 
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop. 
This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the Internet. 
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India. 
And you'll find, you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play. 
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits. 
(Laughter) Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said, "At my age, I don't even buy green bananas." 
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school, and I saw a picture of this green school, I got on an airplane. 
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 
(Laughter) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl. 
And the key to all of this is to make it affordable, to make it exciting, to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. 
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea. 
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him. 
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin, so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery. 
And that realization was about to change my life. 
Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. 
And that Copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. 
She got a support network. 
What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: "What motivates the pollinators?" 
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside. 
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right? 
He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy. 
This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth. 
One day a man told me, "My future does not look brilliant, but I want to have a brilliant future for my son." 
Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry, it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other. 
We traveled through five seas, two oceans, nine ports, and I learned a lot about shipping. 
These become forthright in places we need to protect. 
Whatever. I don't know." 
It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication. 
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. 
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology, an amazing piece of our long, long history. 
Because, simply, most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a 3D printer reads. 
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. 
And now I can admit that it might not too, now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. 
So what if we were living in balloon houses? 
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. 
And that's all very true. 
You can actually see through his head. 
It can fly up, down, forwards, backwards, even upside-down. 
Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13. 
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese." 
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design? 
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on. 
That film we'll be working on for the next two years. 
My outbox for email is massive, and I never look at it. I write all the time, but I never look at my record, at my trace. 
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament." 
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. 
But instead I saw this. 
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart. 
Every individual has a role to play. 
Ready? So here it comes. 
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you, and they're like, we don't know this dish. 
Anybody?" 
That's my little son. 
They just stand around and groom excessively. 
It's owned by extended families. 
So I said, "Well, perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process. 
Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer, there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data, which suggests that car seats are dramatically better. 
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon. 
Basit and Amjad; they are still there. 
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. 
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. 
How can we cook that we have this language developed? 
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. 
But that's not how it happens. 
And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients. 
But we feel like this could work in other places. 
With this in mind, we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. 
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. 
That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. 
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back, "When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?" 
Why is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men's health? 
(Laughter) But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters, means a paragraph, a story. 
It's really old, and it's tired. 
So in the remaining information, in the watermarks, contain the names of, I think it's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage. 
DH: Do you have a small farm animal? 
The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past, a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. 
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner, and I noticed that the edges of the chicken, which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white. 
There's one other kind of new venue, the private MP3 player. 
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people are moderate, pragmatic centrists. 
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today." 
And your eyes ... 
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person. 
Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste, that you like certain things. 
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D. 
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature. 
So what's the problem? 
He'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve, but some thrived." 
And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity transforms into hope, and we know, whether we choose the path of music or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities, within our audiences, if we want to inspire healing from within. 
that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one. 
You've got to think green and green. 
So in space, the Earth is very small. 
(Laughter) Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room -- You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night, your guy will fry them up? 
And she says, "I am." 
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 -- from the millennium scale to the year scale -- to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion. 
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults. 
Now, what does this mean to some of you? 
Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world, due to whatever mutation it has acquired, it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction. 
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. 
And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops. 
And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. 
If you have an idea, send it back to us." 
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel. 
And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic, most fundamental human staple. 
The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive, starting in 539 B.C., when King Cyrus the Great of Persia liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity. 
How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years? 
It meant something that would connect us all together. 
And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. 
I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot, "My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!" 
The mediator is from Pune, India. 
And try that again and do that for another generation. 
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order, and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament. 
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. 
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. 
And so just the act of compromise itself, and sustained, real compromise, would give us even more time, would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road. 
Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat. 
Is it working? 
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. 
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of at least two of them being, you know, design objects. 
I take lunch hour. (Applause) This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps. 
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own, which they've all agreed on, and they love. 
What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about. 
This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following. 
Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot. 
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic, selfish individuals? 
So, we left. 
And I ask you, stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. 
Thank you to you all. 
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth -- they're not very good swimmers -- and we know what's happening to the ice. 
And I get, over time, bored by them. 
What are dogs like? 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. 
The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean, and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean. 
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. 
It doesn't do it with a chemical. 
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. 
what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors, instead of net plunderers? 
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers. 
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa. 
I studied one single virtue: trustworthiness. 
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press. 
And it's spacial modulation -- these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details -- but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data. 
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity? 
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours, once we've set up the right chemistry. 
Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today. 
They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state. 
Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working, by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. 
And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. 
Now, just a fun thing: what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice. 
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding, I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second, and became the new national record-holder on my first try out. 
And then, to have to deal with large groups, say, at the nation-state level, and we had to have mutual non-aggression, or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. 
That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. 
California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states. 
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. 
This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world, in the cities and in the countryside. 
All the bankers said to their clients, "Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else." 
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous. 
And they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on. 
♫ Strolling along in Central Park ♫ ♫ Everyone's out today ♫ ♫ The daisies and dogwoods are all in bloom ♫ ♫ Oh, what a glorious day ♫ ♫ For picnics and Frisbees and roller skaters, ♫ ♫ Friends and lovers and lonely sunbathers ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January ♫ (Laughter) (Applause) ♫ I brought the iced tea; ♫ ♫ Did you bring the bug spray? ♫ ♫ The flies are the size of your head ♫ ♫ Next to the palm tree, ♫ ♫ Did you see the 'gators ♫ ♫ Looking happy and well fed? ♫ 
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year. 
So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it? 
But fun is not enough. 
As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? 
It's a very large number of galaxies. 
The idea that in that room at that moment, everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion, comes together. 
Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live. 
And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that. 
But they stop there. 
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. 
We're going to talk about that some more. 
The second is modifying our emotions. 
We listen to differences, we discount sounds that remain the same. 
And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out. 
It's all "figure." 
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu. 
All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. 
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go, and our choice, so to speak, in technology, is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves. 
And, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form. 
We see a flick of the tail. 
We really have to ask the question: Can the world sustain that number of automobiles? 
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T. 
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness, I like her weight issues, I like how she's transformed talk television, I like how she's brought reading back to America -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment: it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone. 
What we've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S. 
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. 
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. 
That we see there's a general hammer, and hammers become more and more specific over time. 
This is Mountains Out of Molehills, a timeline of global media panic. 
So, it's a bit of a curve, that. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to? 
But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles. 
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. 
If you have a waterfall in there, right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly." 
So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. 
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush." 
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. 
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in. 
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side. 
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together. 
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air. 
And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, "Because I'm the daddy, that's why." 
2.5 to one, great. 
I said, "I don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad's still alive." 
In "Wonders of the Solar System," we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal. 
Now, when he speaks about plants, everything is correct. 
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity, in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. 
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters; it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated. 
That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler. 
(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...) Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind, many children have permanent conditions. 
We can't stop learning at age 21. 
And the comedy comes along, dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest -- race, religion, politics, sexuality -- only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin, we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows, revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. 
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true? 
Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with. 
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know." 
(Laughter) So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl, so I'm still looking happy. 
(Applause) So each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up. 
And yet, we don't talk about it very much. 
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. 
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. 
He was hoping it was going to work out okay. 
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light? 
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times. 
That's the difference. 
This is an exciting new venture. 
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it's all going to crash and burn, which is tough on their shareholders. 
How did he learn them? 
Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space. 
This is the root. 
On the other hand, the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. 
Well let me show you. 
Furthermore, there's an experimental way to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before. 
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat. 
I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed, and you're going to see people, lots of them, missing major body parts. 
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots, and this is what you see: you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here. 
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity. 
And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. 
There's a diagram like this for your brain, but there's no way it would fit on this slide. 
And then on October 29th, the first packet-switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI. 
This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat. 
It's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies, the information on how these early prototype drugs might work. 
Now interestingly, when women are diagnosed with lung cancer, their survival tends to be better than that of men. 
"FeliCity." 
"There is also a strong belief, which I share, that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis." 
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it. 
Not many things didn't work. 
We go through periods of enthrallment, followed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community best characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey. 
When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility. 
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now. 
The federal standards are that you have to score below a 1,000 to be an approved car seat on this crash, in some metric of units which are not important. 
It's a condition; it has to be treated. Strike two is if you get pregnant. 
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top. 
And I had a miniature poodle. 
Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies, then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy. 
(Laughter) And they will say, "Would you mind if I serve the next customer?" 
Now, what does this have to do with energy? 
The important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if, this is a question of when, and how big. 
So how many of you know what I'm talking about? 
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me, I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. 
(Applause) So Luke, before last night, when's the last time you saw Tony? 
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair. 
And then he saw a big wheel in midair. 
People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business. 
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it. 
Now I've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy. 
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set." 
We had plans. 
And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age. 
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen -- it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things -- whether it's equipment, like a media lab, or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools, or schools that are with kids that age, and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. 
Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do. 
And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him. 
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here. 
Economics has become the currency of policy. 
And I received an email from an editor at Random House with a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point. 
Rickroll was this bait and switch, really simple, classic bait and switch. 
Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. 
I'll take your picture just for trying. 
He's going to have to correct for that with steering. 
I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside. 
Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. 
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything. 
And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room, you know, for a couple of months now. 
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. 
And I remember that lesson to this day. 
Well a couple of things: understanding of the security, of the risks, the threats, the countermeasures, how they work. 
You ask Tufte, and he would say, "Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible." 
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves." 
To 1,200? No. 
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria. 
In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. 
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. 
Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible. 
I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done. 
And to understand that, you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works. 
Wherever there is injustice there's anger. 
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. 
That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example. 
We think someone else, someone smarter than us, someone more capable, someone with more resources will solve that problem. 
Roll that tape. 
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies, just barely walking and talking, would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. 
The first is: can we really survive on volunteers? 
It’s a win-win trade: I give you phosphorus, and you feed me. 
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. 
At that point, he asked to be paged into his wife. 
(Laughter) I said to my boy, "When you raise the money, we'll put your taste on the wall." 
So it's acting with its two mouths there. 
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 
So it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion. 
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government? 
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time. 
And, as a result, it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have, the things that actually make us look like real humans. 
We now have 15 sites. 
You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words. Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness. 
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects, but in this one domain, limiting sharing, it has mostly not worked. 
I'm going to skip way ahead here to the space phase. 
When I see a classroom that looks like this, can you imagine how this sounds? 
I just did a seven-country solo tour. 
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here. 
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple. 
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq, "I have to see, I have to see what is happening here. 
Creating an environment of learning, of inquiry, of exploration is what is true education. 
So, it is really a rather lofty initiative, if you want to think that way, but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead, that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. 
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously that "he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for." 
And if we’re running design studios we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition designers through these different experiences? 
That's the retreat of this glacier. 
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology. 
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school and post-doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are. 
(Applause) So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. 
Open knowledge, open aid, open governance, and together, they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. 
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe, and particularly in the Netherlands, and whenever I talk about the experience economy there, I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question, almost invariably. 
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it. 
And this routine went on for some time. 
That's what it would really mean to be conservative. 
How many children did you have? 
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine, but today, evidence tells us otherwise. 
So let me back up a little bit. 
So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch, including drinking Listerine. 
(Laughter) And so every time they found something that looked a little different, they named it something different. 
FG: Ask Miriam! 
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. 
(Laughter) So, my closing thought. 
Take out those who say they save too little. 
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd. 
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. 
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. 
And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers, people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on. 
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. 
He keeps organizing. 
So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time. 
So I find myself asking: where is music in all of this? 
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind, where everyone is needed exactly where they are, like the fibers and the tendons in a bow, a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient. 
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know. 
They have different electrical and magnetic properties. 
We launched a website on September 2nd that has now served 25 million pages, and has 42,000 registered young girl users. 
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like. 
Not that they were any good, but they were there. 
And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't. 
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well. 
Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us. 
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person. 
What's your name? Where are you from? 
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. 
Shake your hands out. 
There are tens of thousands of these. 
By adding a fine, what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels, and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers. 
So there's more new venues. 
I wanted to know which poet he read, and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"], a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be: Broadway, baby. 
So, this is sort of a complication I've found. 
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by turbulence, and all too often by blood. 
For most people, if they think about hunger, they don't have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives, or their grandparents' lives -- to remember an experience of hunger. 
A woman came from Africa with music. 
Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. 
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments, with passions raging on all sides, are big questions of moral philosophy, big questions of justice. 
And that's what I'm going to talk about, how a small change leads to a very big revolution. 
About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough -- one of my great, kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson." 
Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TEDTalk: "Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer." 
I always relate things to kitchen-ry. 
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. 
And The 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. 
But I know it when I see it." 
But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that leaves the field of play? 
And along the way I've started noticing -- I'm on my third generation of kids -- that they're getting bigger. 
And start building stuff. 
The exact converse is also true. 
The cornflake hadn't been invented. 
And finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong. 
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. 
Of course, this is Utopia; it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom. 
I'm going to go back to today, now, and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is. 
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. 
And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump, and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. 
But it's deteriorating. 
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. 
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem. 
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time, and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves. 
(Applause) Contagious is a good word. 
But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox: this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh -- when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus, thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror. 
I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin. 
And together they changed the fate of their nation. 
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms. 
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications. 
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there. 
And we just record what we see." 
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth. 
Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy. 
And where, at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law, on the international stage it is not. 
But the compromise, I felt, was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs. 
I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. 
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. 
It is going to extend its legs out. 
So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it, we could then transplant it. 
(Applause) I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877, with a mathematician named Georg Cantor. 
Who cleans up after us? 
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists, and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution. 
They'll give me that information, and we'll make the care of the patient better. 
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care. 
Do nothing. 
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know." 
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe -- and I could be wrong, but I don't think I am -- that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -- primordial feelings, by the way. 
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. 
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. 
Gene ended up using his coat, and his fist in the coat, to break open a liquor cabinet. 
It completely changed what I could do. 
We could just re-label things. 
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective. 
How many people times how much water. 
It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet. 
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts. 
And I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchanging one thing for another. 
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. 
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects, earthworms, fungi -- but in general, on land, it's really rare. 
So, I've always been Googling this word, "human," to find out how many hits I get. 
And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. 
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen, until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth, which is, you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car, if you use hydrogen. 
Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations. 
Later on, we took them home. 
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. 
I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study, and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love. 
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty. 
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms -- so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. 
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo. 
I don't want to talk about that now. 
TR: Thanks. 
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here. 
But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti-corruption site. 
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. 
You see a dolphin here, and there's a dolphin, and there's a dolphin. 
The amount of resources we put in are disparate. 
There is only one opinion that matters, the kids that are either going to use it or not." 
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution; it's not about the climate change. 
It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks. 
My true love lives up the river; a few more jumps and I'll be with her. 
This is something that happened without foreign investment, without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds, in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy. 
Because that is what Julian Assange did. 
Why would that matter? 
There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins, so I kind of exposed that. 
Yet we have these files. 
We've put five people in so far, and indeed, we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying. 
We know the average American physician interrupts their patient in 14 seconds. 
Because there’s a lot of money in sandalwoods. 
(Applause) This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta. 
"Wopp!" they will say. 
So you see, they are spread all over the city. 
Thank you very much. 
I'm biased. 
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter. 
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East. 
And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball? 
It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up, that has fascinated people throughout history. 
Well, the evidence is, unfortunately, ample. 
They, that one, is hairy and walking on four legs. 
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. 
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, "If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave." 
Now, I was about halfway through my pro career in, I would say, the mid-'80s. 
There is things to see, there is the big challenge. 
And this is something that we're very excited about. 
Can I do that one again? 
(Laughter) Yes, I have a team. (Laughter) And the team is expert, and the team is courageous, and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery, as is true with any major expedition on the planet. 
And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. 
If you look at birds, which live a long time, cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide, things like that. 
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it. 
And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. 
And guess what? 
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability. 
Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions: assumption, things are as we know them; presumption, things will behave as we expect; and context in reality, our knowledge of the world as we know it, such as scale. 
You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world, even in developed countries. 
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet. 
My mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else." 
This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest. 
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul. 
And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to. 
And one of these is boundary crossing. 
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. 
Here's my solution. 
Every parent I know, myself included, feels like we're constantly playing defense. 
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. 
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. 
Look at the state of preservation -- still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts. 
Between April and August, 1994, one million people were slaughtered. 
That was her resistance. 
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist, but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. 
Former oil man Maurice Strong said, "Not all the fossils are in the fuel." 
But actually, it's a tremendous problem, because how can we ever see differently? 
Now get out your handkerchiefs here. 
And this is the new paradigm, which we gathered two, three years back, recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future, aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past. 
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second, it would have taken five hours to show you that number. 
If you really want to get a lot from solar panels, you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too. 
I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities, ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me, you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan, well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car. 
Now what form do they take? 
But sometimes I feel really lonely. 
But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car, it doesn't look like a Volvo, and it doesn't look like a Hummer. 
That's my story. Thanks. 
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. 
So as a youngster, I tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes, constantly drawing airplanes. 
It's very successful, and it's helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now, or have announced plans to be, retrofitted. 
The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that, who would actually do such a thing? 
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed -- like trees and grasses and so on -- tend to cause the most hay fever. 
My other great passion is the environment. 
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station. 
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. 
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C. 
And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us. 
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations. 
He came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. 
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent. 
So, in a sense, there's not much new. 
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent. 
So before it was: I have a feeling, I want to make a call. 
And it's vital we understand this. 
And he turned to me, and he said, "Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat." 
And eventually, we can come up with something like this. 
Because that's where all the ocean is." 
Here's another example of this. 
They had to take that class with me. 
Parallel universes. 
The bronze is nice hard, durable material that could roll on the ground. 
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it. 
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. 
Some people say it's not population decline. 
(Laughter) And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888. 
We don't know for sure, but there are theories. 
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. 
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. 
Let's look at the best academic performer: the province of Shanghai, China. 
"I think so." 
We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. 
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole. 
So these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives, because there was that outside audience, there was Isabel Allende on the other end. 
It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be, meeting important needs, not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share. 
It was essentially India being itself. 
I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time. 
And yet, you put them together in a particular network, and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet. 
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics. 
What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others, however distantly. 
This theory and others like it are long shots. 
He needed them to feel protected. 
There's some basic things that you would want to understand. 
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom. 
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back. 
And there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see. 
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do. 
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head. 
But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. 
NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. 
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. 
And the day I came out of Biosphere 2, I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. 
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty. 
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media. 
But, there is good news. 
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me with good spatial qualities, for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things. 
And what I do is I study insects. 
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application. 
If, for example, terrorism almost never happens, it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures. 
Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation, there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard. 
This is not something I've made up. 
Zoe: Stop. 
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience, new narratives to reclaim my identity. 
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile. 
We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up. 
So someone came up with a very clever idea, to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder, what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth. 
It's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there." 
We knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities. 
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people. 
This is the ARES team; we have about 150 scientists, engineers; where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. 
The CDC has a program, Heads Up. 
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. 
Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers. 
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable, treatable diseases, and 178 million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting, a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment. 
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world, because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males. 
Thank you very much. 
(Laughter) As you can see, these are all maps. 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. 
It's backed by NASA and Google, and other leaders in the high-tech and science community. 
I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there. 
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it, and then we come along and eat that poor critter, and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well. 
And this can get really dangerous. 
(Whistling) Some whistled badly. 
And I'm making all those kinds of windows. 
So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again. 
In contrast, theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing, things where the driver is thinking quite a bit. 
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. 
(Applause) Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.) LP: A quick question for you. 
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer. 
There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean, which collected more garbage than they did animals. 
When someone tells you, "People don't care about privacy," consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy, and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. 
And it's a number of projects. 
Joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war. 
In other words, everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast, if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior, which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence. 
Two children watch a TEDTalk. 
The very practice is demoralized, and the practitioners are demoralized. 
And as she told me all of these things, I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor. 
Because we have real problems. 
And so it's no surprise that overall, industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials. 
That's an unnatural act for a rocket. 
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. 
Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. 
Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door, then the door slamming fearfully shut, only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does, day and night into the hall. 
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. 
This is the Hejaz Railway. 
It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity. 
Bono spoke very eloquently, that we have the tools, for the first time, to address age-old problems of disease and poverty. 
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies, and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening. 
We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive, prevention-driven? 
Now during the clinical trial, she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge, and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds. 
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking, observing, the same star for 20 years is incredible. 
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes. 
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT. 
So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. 
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill, which will be different from that of anybody else. 
So we could get three thumbs together, and Peter could join us. 
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University, and we tried to start very simply. 
Add 25, we get 40. 
You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. 
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. 
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. 
It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down. 
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive. 
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food. 
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons. 
I just remember this unbelievable, just utter chaos. 
(Video) (Music) Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head. 
If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index, that data series, go back to the early 1970s, you see exactly the same contrast. 
So, next thing I did is I got on the phone. 
And until you have children, you don't know what it's like." 
And this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance, to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism, but at the same time remain hopeful. 
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened. 
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium, and then we're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end. 
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun. 
There were others, like myself, who were full-time. 
Well we know that tails store fat, for example. 
That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. 
Within that sphere, most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain, and a very small minority are actual military actions. 
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage. 
And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story. 
So after collecting the money, when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods. 
In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. 
The first reason is local open feedstocks. 
No hope of describing that. 
However, especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills, the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration, renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. 
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. 
Second, security. Third, relationships. 
I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. 
The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors, are where you find the majority of the African people, the real people in Africa. That's where you find them. 
Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation. 
With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. 
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? 
So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit. 
Half of those students were given, as a topic, the parable of the Good Samaritan: the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road. 
You're all a member of tribes. 
But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. 
BF: This guy, this guy invented air. 
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. 
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble. 
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia. 
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. 
IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here. 
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. 
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. 
Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them. 
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war? 
And the audience just -- you know, they're always on the side of the interviewee, and they felt that this was a kind of assault, but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. 
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. 
It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter) I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big. 
Should I skip that part? 
Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham, two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland, you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury, so we have to make it happen. 
Thank you very much. 
We were the best and the brightest. 
Hi there. 
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed." 
It's happening! 
And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. 
You also have the mathematical structure, talking about grids, measurements, labels, points, axes, that sort of thing. 
I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. 
I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life, then I could be happy. 
(Laughter) Until Volta, nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use. 
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen. 
Well, I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so, while I've been speaking, you have been scanned. 
What kind of a world can we be making?" 
Even as a scientist, I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible, with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work, until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell, who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. 
Many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks. 
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia," which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. 
How on Earth have you done that? 
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. 
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed. 
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer. 
These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and what it does -- the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. 
So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.

They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. 
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings. 
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. 
Here he is talking from the 1960s. 
(Applause) Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn. 
And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning. 
If Matt's in the audience, I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second, this character from your series. 
And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information. 
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar. 
In fact, it's continued to increase. 
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. 
The wall was covered with ... 
And there we are, I can give them to you. 
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch. 
When this first came out, it was just a really exciting thing, the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all. 
So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier, the traditional African methods for doing self-organization. 
He had to tour around Europe to support his family -- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -- but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception. 
Huge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta. 
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot. 
But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way. 
GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods. 
Seamounts are important for biodiversity. 
I became timely. 
Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. 
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. 
But another layer of representation was still introduced. 
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. 
(Music) So imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony. 
And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip, and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. 
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood, of this incredible film industry, following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption, called "Checkpoint." 
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves. 
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex. 
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. 
By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time. 
They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day. 
And together we improve the original concept. 
It was about 115 degrees. 
So this petition started to take off -- humongously fast, you have no idea. 
So we took the commission. 
or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today." 
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color. 
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug? 
We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice, or the user's voice. 
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend. 
These also require tremendous amounts of energy. 
Barber shops, rap concerts, and most importantly, in the black church. 
Here, I'll show it to you. 
We can use different neurons with different variations. 
He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels, and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. 
The same for GPS. 
So when does this transition begin? 
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper. 
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it]. 
Hence, the 2 sigma problem. 
And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff. 
Our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time, and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times. 
This got me thinking. 
They listen to the spirits like this -- I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because, when she died, she had the family will, and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is, so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?" 
A giant battery could. 
On the other hand, statistics -- that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis. Right? 
We only talk about one side of it. 
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found. 
He had been faced with desperate circumstances. 
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen. 
They're homelands of somebody. 
What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility. 
And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row to arrive here. 
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car. 
And you can understand how different it's going to be, the image of Rio with the system -- one-minute frequency. 
And our PC version became quite mature. 
And I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics. 
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific, contextual, timely and immediate, is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented. 
I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. 
The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" -- how it brought back my college sweetheart, my first real love, who -- till I left her -- played the same record. 
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget -- the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness. 
Run, duck, play dead and hide. 
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests? 
Right after I completed my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration. 
So on the left, I took the roughness copied from many landscapes. 
I am told you will go from here. 
(Applause) Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. 
The oil will never run out. 
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right? 
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. 
And each day, a thousand babies -- a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. 
(Laughter) He's like, "Huh!" 
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that. 
Since then, no one has ever skied -- this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. 
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. 
By the way, just so you know: you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms; there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified. 
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. 
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it. 
I was 26. I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go, I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear. 
It's important to remember that we evolved. 
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others. 
At least, I thought it was till I got these slides. 
Because his grave was exhumed. 
Here are some recent images. 
But you can't run a country like China, a civilization-state, on the basis of one civilization, one system. 
(Laughter) So, here are these women, who never discuss their period with their husbands, and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?" 
The napalm is burning there quite nicely. 
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi? 
The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage." 
What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here, of a female king cobra making her nest. 
Now, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this, but it turns out my colleague, Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has develeloped a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. 
Someone making the experience their own. 
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find? 
Then we match them in pairs by computer. 
(Murmuring) Pardon? 
He electrifies only the outside. 
My expedition was down in Camp Three, while these guys were up there in the storm. 
Maybe you think, it's his phone. 
Miklos: Must download file contents. 
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club. 
So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions for computer-human interaction. 
But then you enter the Redwood canopy, and it's like coming through a layer of clouds. 
So everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention, and there's no priorities. 
As the price performance makes new applications feasible, new applications come to the market. 
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera. 
Scientists agree now. 
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. 
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. 
So, a mass of new discoveries. 
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they? 
But if you need to reach more places than just one, you need to move the robot. 
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. 
The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland. 
There's a water jet that cleans you. 
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around these little plants, and they're collecting pollen, those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive, and that's what makes the beehive, the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar, and that's what makes the honey that we eat. 
So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there and saying, "I don't know what to say." 
And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon, perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking, or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe, why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens. 
Now think about the following: if China and India were as rich as the United States is today, the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now. 
Here it is. 
(Laughter) So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten. 
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting. 
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar." 
The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you. 
And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way. 
You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment. 
This experience raised a lot of questions, among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. 
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes? 
And now we've got the words, and we can apply the special sauce: the translation. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together, because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated, as well as other very detail-oriented tasks, that they are concentrating geographically and finding like-minded mates. 
"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates. 
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for, that was unexpected and unpredictable. 
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system, which polluted the atmosphere of this star. 
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing. 
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this. 
(Applause) The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. 
(Applause) So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. 
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. 
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within. 
JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place. 
After this, we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see. 
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water. 
And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves. 
And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. 
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai. 
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay? 
And your body somehow knows that. 
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron. 
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO2. 
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention. 
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later. 
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. 
It's boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket. 
But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing, so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never, of course, admitting that I was doing so. 
But it was obvious to me, right? Buy low, sell high. 
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?" 
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage, some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid, the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. 
CP: You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. 
You know that when you have those abusive voices, all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical, and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape, you might have yourself depression. 
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids. 
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world." 
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. 
So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. 
The first word that comes up is "doctor." 
Of course, the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems, but things got really interesting just a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind, built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy, but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star. 
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. 
I've never had the opportunity to say it before. 
You know, this is one of my favorite devices. 
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings. 
So, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing. 
We're on the edge through a large part of the time. 
I want to be a doctor to serve them." 
Here it is. That's the same kid. 
Why do we show our emotions? 
The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science, technology, globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility: the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth. 
So here's a picture of the octopamine system. 
I think we all already know that. 
And he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around." 
The path to truly new, never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way. 
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level that you would expect, and the reason's very simple. 
And they will have the pleasure, many of them, of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop, helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild. 
What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic, and in many ways very decentralized. 
So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference. 
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer." 
He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that. 
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak. 
There's a camera. 
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs. 
Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects? 
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks. 
Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there. 
My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem. 
After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it. 
It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. 
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. 
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now? 
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again, all preventable and treatable. 
Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed, and of course that's had an impact on deception. 
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business. 
Through a program of observational research, brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping, they've developed a completely new way to change shift. 
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives. 
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit, the slow bit of the brain -- using that. 
And most importantly for this, it'll tell us why we have language. 
I mean, just to put it in perspective, 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. 
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. 
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron, the building blocks of planets and of life. 
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army, said, "Airplanes are interesting toys, but of no military value." 
(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask. 
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. 
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. 
You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy, or problem of libido. 
Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely. 
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. 
Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin. 
Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. 
That's the corner of the whole thing. 
This is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics. 
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. 
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. 
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand, were also listed as dead. 
And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city, which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm James Randi, and I'm waiting. 
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is a really important developmental process, because gray matter contains cell bodies and connections between cells, the synapses, and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning, the elimination of unwanted synapses. 
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn't taken it from somebody else. 
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. 
Now, this one's pretty cool. 
Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor. 
We expect by this time next year, it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it. 
We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps. 
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me, but I have no idea who they are. 
Here's another example. 
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?" 
And when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries and reignited the epidemic. 
So let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit. 
I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter) So this, again, is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the Earth. 
I hope, I believe. 
It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be, and a tradition we may have forgotten. 
(Laughter) I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good. 
But with new or better vaccines for malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia, diarrhea, flu, we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. 
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. 
And he was here, as you well know, in '35. 
In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones. 
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids. 
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second, we can make a judgment on somebody's face. 
And I was there with my arms open. 
I say, "Oh, no, I continue." 
You know, try making some charts like this at home. 
Some shut down the self using meditation. 
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous. 
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop. 
Let me show you the next slide. 
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. 
And I had this vague recollection of seeing these yellow fish with a black spot, and I thought, "Aw, damn. I should have caught one. 
Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built. 
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that, whoa, chop suey is actually not known in China. 
And now I'm going to live to 85. 
We're concerned in the national security community, and of course in the biology community and the public health community. 
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual. 
First, I'm going to fly you over the rings. 
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man. 
Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace. 
Less than four percent actually go back to jail. 
How are you going to get them to work for this force? 
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity. 
I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace. 
DH: Everything up here's OK? 
And this too requires investment, investment -- for example, in places -- places where we can connect, places where we can participate, shared spaces, concert halls, gardens, public parks, libraries, museums, quiet centers, places of joy and celebration, places of tranquility and contemplation, sites for the "cultivation of a common citizenship," in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. 
I don't care how you make 'em. 
One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. 
Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. 
So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. 
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies. 
Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick. 
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics, I just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients." 
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line? 
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. 
So with our technology, we can tell right away. 
And if you're in the direct fallout zone here, you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there, and that's clear. But if you are sheltered, you can actually survive. 
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. 
Well, the unknown is part of life. 
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes. 
And I woke up from my visualization and I said, who was that? I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha, two very famous Indian actresses, like the Meryl Streeps of India. 
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. 
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. 
The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. 
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system. 
So as the seasons changed, and it was time to plan the dance again, one girl named Brianna spoke up, and she said, "My dad can't come to the dance, and this whole thing is making me sad." 
So bingo, problem solved. 
Born and raised in Baltimore, he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate, and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. 
And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world, we are not powerless. 
And this is what this exhibition looks at. 
For a few days, they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned. 
Everybody could go and listen, you know -- ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims. 
Older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning, angry faces. 
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. 
You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. 
No, I'm not even going to look up. No." 
Someday, a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. 
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ... 
But technology alone isn't enough. 
And it's this feeding back into the old brain that'll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions. 
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that's a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, that's collected anyway by the operator, in order to understand how the city works. 
It's fast, it's pretty private. 
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days. 
It does increase security. 
And that was very cool stuff back then. 
It's about our beliefs and expectations. 
For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- (Laughter) across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. 
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around. 
(Laughter) But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. 
We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger. 
In "Little Gidding" he says -- speaking I think for the human race, but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia -- "We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time, arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. 
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy. 
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares, it's we, life, who are searching. 
How do you plan to look for it? 
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art? 
If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. 
There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia, called the Tasmanian tiger. 
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve. 
Again though, to make it come alive you need, somehow, to add the human element. 
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily. 
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. 
It's 1876, it's in Boston, and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. 
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars, being paid in bribes every year, or equal to India's GDP. 
The other soldier also came. 
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it: third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. 
There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems, and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business. 
So we are doing our job. 
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. 
And there was a sincere concern there. 
It didn't happen accidentally. 
And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood. 
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. 
Don't you in the front row worry or anything. 
Information spreads in populations, norms can spread in populations, behaviors can spread in populations. 
(Laughter) And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule, and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA, and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. 
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. 
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site, asking for people to join us in this enterprise. 
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. 
On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon, we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. 
It was the early '90s, and I was at a public event. 
But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally, but completely -- quite the contrary. The United States, for example, can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time, led by business for profit, because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. 
It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact. 
What values do we most uphold? 
Thank you. 
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job. 
(Applause) Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me. 
Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous. 
Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. 
We need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines. 
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. 
This is another one of my favorite fish. 
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. 
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. 
They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. 
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned about a society today, you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific, of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as 
They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. 
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony. 
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. 
That's the story of thousands of people. 
And I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?" 
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't, or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable? 
Is it that I analyze the data very well? 
We can start to see that system. 
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares. 
Okay, fine. How do you know what would have happened without the aid? 
Media, the media landscape that we knew, as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs, is increasingly slipping away. 
It's such a huge subject." 
So what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body, much like a small car behind a big car on the highway. 
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache," but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason." 
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers. 
And I think this is what we've done with climate change. 
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it. 
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes -- and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. 
Even when they're doing it for other reasons. 
And there were people, strategists, within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese. 
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. 
We biologically inspired this robot, named RHex, built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years. 
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one. 
So if these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more. 
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming. 
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right, that over the past 20 years, we've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information, and now we're entering the third trust wave: connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces. 
I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this -- my father was the most sincere man possible. 
This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped. 
They took out two of my broken ribs, and they rebuilt my back, L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together. 
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site? 
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA. 
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good. 
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab. 
Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying, from the past, okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. 
But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. 
Rain. Not bad. Not bad. 
We think that this these "why" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. 
But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for Lego, no problem. 
First of all, the rules have changed. 
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp. 
And that unity is something that connects all of creation. 
In addition to making this personal -- so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women's relationship with their heart -- we're going to wax into the politics. 
I got out of the car, and I stood up, and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround, and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen. 
People are ready and respond to the story of food. 
Why do we do that? Why do we do that? 
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. 
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it, and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle. 
But the reason I could come here is because of that. 
I chucked in my job at Accenture. 
How does that compare to a normal school? 
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank, so I want you to stop your doings." 
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers. 
It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level. 
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes," back in 2005. 
The problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver, and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters, did that drug help you or not? 
I look at this picture and it freaks me out. 
Go one step up, and you get to farmers, who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards. 
Larry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little? 
We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute, every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights. 
I think architecture is about consensus. 
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue. 
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. 
The computational power is amazing. 
It seems overwhelming. 
In the babies of those women who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD, following their ordeal, researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD -- an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester. 
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it, I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay? 
They are able to respond to gravity, of course, so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. 
Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this, these are films that are distributed directly in markets. 
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends. 
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity. 
I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. 
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage -- It's a very good webpage. I recommend it -- and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends. 
So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -- like heating, cooling etc. -- and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on. 
Like a lot. 
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. 
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture. 
And she wanted to study the Talmud. 
You can run these off -- they're really hungry, they really like down-blended weapons pits, so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that's been down-blended. 
So, that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being, bipedal walking, what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right? 
That could power a rocket there. 
Now as you may know, sound travels in waves, so if you have a speaker, a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal, transform it into a vibration, which is then transported through the air, is captured by our ear, and transformed into an audio signal again. 
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he? 
The second year, it was a total of 15 million. 
And so I went on. 
That is the essence of being human. 
I've described to you the opposite of a success story. 
In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama. 
Each time I street juggle I use improvisation. 
It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design, but actually there's an economics behind architecture that we don't talk about, and I think we need to. 
You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. 
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model. 
A toroid, for those who don't know, is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel. 
I'll look away from the picture. 
This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep. 
The only difference is that now you're only working with 21 percent oxygen. 
Yves showed one of the power-generating devices. 
So if we have to reset the baseline, if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left, how can we do it? 
Thank you. 
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it. 
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency. 
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean? 
We don't live in the center of the solar system, we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. 
(Music) Now something else. 
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. 
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. 
They're watching the concert through their cell phone. 
Well we can begin to ask those questions also. 
It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer. 
But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school. 
Before the Scientific Revolution, they believed that everything important, knowable, was already known, enshrined in ancient writings, institutions, and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb -- which were, however, entrenched as dogmas, along with many falsehoods. 
And later on, when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time, I went back to him and I was sort of asking him, you know, what am I gonna do? 
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product. 
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean. 
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down. 
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it's transparent. 
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. 
I had no idea how it was possible. 
So what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system. 
Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this, and others look like this, and some look like this, and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious. 
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art, but of an encyclopedic museum, and today, 140 years later, that vision is as prescient as ever, because, of course, we live in a world of crisis, of challenge, and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 newsreels. 
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?" 
These are two kids from Project Exploration. 
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. 
It's still there. 
So, my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. 
And as a final parting thought, on behalf of future archeologists, I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth. 
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that. 
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter. 
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. 
(Applause) About 75 years ago, my grandfather, a young man, walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that, and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen: none other than Mae West, the heartthrob of the '30s, and he could never forget her. 
Let's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping. 
10 years ago, Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients. 
And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. 
Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest. 
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. 
We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field. 
Do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest? 
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them. 
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. 
It's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up. 
So, these are what I would call behavioral markers. 
Come on, honey, tell it to me." 
And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I. 
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum. 
And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. 
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing. 
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy, and we know that many other stars have planetary systems. 
And he wrote this: "Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. 
And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale," this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing. 
What if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented, just happy to be you. 
Who's a RISD alum out there? 
And I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine," which was my nickname. 
You're safe. It's fine. 
For instance, the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves. 
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score. 
That is the premise of this particular presentation. 
So, the problem is that the clinical trial was done, and we were a part of it, and in the fundamental clinical trial -- the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three, we refused to use a placebo. 
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. 
We need — thank you. (Applause) Exploration is the engine that drives innovation. 
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now. 
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions. 
Similarly today in the West you're seeing the problem of entitlement -- the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid. 
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass, rolled steel and mass production, we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views, and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces. 
In two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them, they're 30 times stronger than Kevlar. 
It's changing our lives in so many ways, and it will continue to do that. 
And we are always being tempted up to our neck. 
And the thing is, it's not just big industry. 
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa, which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick. 
And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight. 
Billions of dollars are spent every year, all over the globe, on these charlatans. 
Here is a three-week-old baby. 
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth; Ghana has discovered oil; Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. 
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio, photographs, movies, even lectures like this one -- we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position, some kind of omniscient, external body through whose eyes you see the story. 
It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. 
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. 
Here, you can see in 2006, they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest, and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo; they're not going as far away. 
So thank you very much. 
So the idea was there. 
It's a perfectly great city. 
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. 
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford. 
Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. 
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better. 
Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. 
Another way of putting it is, is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve, yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem? 
Al Jazeera brought information to them, showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion, exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, and allowed them, gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions. 
What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important. 
So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access? 
And it doesn't just stay on the screen. 
You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people, in the U.K. alone, with massive musical potential. 
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels. 
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons, molecules, rather than the entire cell. 
Thank you. 
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent, I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. 
Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague, Art Aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love, in a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI. 
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. 
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. 
But we're going to start small. 
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. 
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. 
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent. 
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. 
(Laughter) So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass. 
It's two houses. 
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator, and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. 
Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. 
Haigh's Chocolate, in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia, stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby. 
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty. 
But there is an underbelly. 
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions. 
That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid. 
By saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me." 
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration, and we have a lot of spacecraft out there. 
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home. 
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you. 
And it's very powerful. 
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. 
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. 
And at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join." 
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka, who was at that time starting out Sony without any money, without a product -- they didn't have a product, they didn't have anything, but they had an idea. 
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives, there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine. 
So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity. 
This is DNA in its classic double helix form. 
(Laughter) So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved, and expressed it. 
I'd been there twice, and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. 
Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. 
From user name Liquidsore29 -- interesting user names we have here— &amp;quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&amp;quot; Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay. 
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. 
That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago. 
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like. 
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people. 
So, back in the ancient times. 
This book is taking rather a long time, but I'm nearly done. 
And so please consider this a work in progress, but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma, about the protein target, the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer, called BRD4, and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute called JQ1, which we affectionately named for Jun Qi, the chemist that made this molecule. 
And this is how it works: Patent holders, inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions, but make those patents available to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents. 
Some will be down to two or three. 
That's not the expression of joy. 
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden. 
Yet it would do very little good. 
You take them for a walk. 
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. 
Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean, since the past two years. I received training at this institution. 
More useful than a solid gold surgeon, but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment. 
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world. 
But looking at video clips posted by strangers, a world of possibility opens up for him. 
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies. 
But that care means also you learn. 
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter) With nuclear, what do we have? 
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. 
(Applause) Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries. 
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd. 
But some plants are manipulating animals, like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. 
I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. 
It was the largest empire the world had known until then. 
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. 
Recently, a friend posed a question: If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me, would I take it? 
Two-and-a-half years in the making. 
All that savage grandeur, the steely glinting hooves, the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards, breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared, I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him. 
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability. 
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. 
So I'm surprised. 
My dad was, which is kind of an interesting way to grow up. 
The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. 
The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter. 
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here," because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison. 
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. 
Everything about my work has become more whimsical. 
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead, scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect. 
In my experience, there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible. 
Thank you. 
And you know they're international because they put it "en Francais" as well. 
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women. 
What has happened since, and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century? 
Meanwhile, my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy's bag around and get paid 10 bucks. 
But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends, and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point. 
Well, there are three main advantages to a rebreather. 
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left. 
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope, when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things. 
I've been away 20 years in total. 
He's very shy, too. 
None of us ever get through this life without heartache, without turmoil, and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality, you find your way, and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders, and she said, "Let's find our way to Florida." 
And as this article points out, "The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey." 
I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks. Okay? 
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think. 
And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff. 
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled, 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years, and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities, but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues. 
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. 
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. 
So it's clear that things are changing. 
So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom. 
It was truly exciting. 
And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding, for support. 
And these are more practical applications. 
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of, if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature. 
They know how to plant organic rice, they know how to look after it, they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. 
So, from 2008 up until today, a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. 
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. 
Yes, let's just go work this thing out. 
Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways, or leaning against the body. 
So if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group. 
The elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together, the darkness of the body. 
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing. 
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. 
There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati -- that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. 
Twitter recently did some research. 
And so as these elements come together, I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. 
Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path? 
(Laughter) (Applause) Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right. 
Of course, the reality is quite different. 
Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. 
(Laughter) But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like. 
And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. 
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. 
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line. 
My desire to disappear was still very powerful. 
(Applause) And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art. 
Now, it could be that motion pictures -- and eventually, virtual reality, or something equivalent to it -- some sort of immersive display, is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that we're in. 
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. 
It's not just about terrorism, though. 
This kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons, God forbid, in weapons of mass destruction, is part of the threat to the global commons. 
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy, you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys. 
It's that you can see the world as it isn't. 
And it's a foregone conclusion, if you give a drug at that high a dose, that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better. 
These are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation, soil loss, water use, pesticide use, over-fishing, etc. 
The treaties were out the window. 
I think there's a big lesson in that. 
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital. 
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs. 
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here, and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say. 
This young child is eight years old. 
In contrast, the African malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person, and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosqui-toes, you see? (Laughter) That's right. (Applause) And so we started focusing on the smell of feet, on the smell of human feet, until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse. Think of it. 
Here's crabs here, worms here. 
But ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere. 
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. 
Amazing possibility. 
And this gets us back to the mushrooms. 
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle. 
Why is it, on the radio news every evening, I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio -- I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news. 
"Kew, kew, kew -- watch out." 
(Applause) ♫ I think I'm ready to do my thing ♫ ♫ I think I'm ready to take my chances ♫ ♫ I've been dining out and all stressed out ♫ ♫ Due to the circumstances. See? ♫ ♫ I gotta get up, get up, get up, get up ♫ ♫ Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up ♫ ♫ I see what you're saying ♫ ♫ We sent a demo to the world, they said it sounds like Take 6 ♫ ♫ I said "Hold on, wait a minute, I'll be back with the remix" ♫ ♫ They looking at us funny, we can't make any money ♫ 
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this. 
The question is, what's the good you can do with it? 
But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. 
We want to satisfy our individual desires. 
That takes time. 
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. 
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor. 
And the material looks something like this. 
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants, we completely miss the story. 
With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. 
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. 
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization. 
And this is why, traditionally, surgeries have always started so early in the morning -- to take advantage of daylight hours. 
All of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression. 
This is him on the screen. 
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill. 
But that's what we're going to do. 
If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands, you see these things that look like teeth. 
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. 
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo, so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated. 
But how do you go about doing all this scanning? 
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone, not connected with others, not working with others, is no longer a viable proposition. 
And so they had to cram the sign. 
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. 
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry. 
And he still is holding this line. 
Unfortunately here -- and, really, regrettably -- first of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically. 
We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel, or two-foundation morality. 
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions, or making invisible macaroni and cheese. 
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing. 
When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. 
And we're seeing a steady increase among males. 
The opposite of play is not work. 
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. 
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries. 
There are thousands of suppliers in there." 
They have respite homes, the first, the first care centers, the first counseling services -- and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore, but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. 
You take -- that's a Canadian expression. 
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983. 
So, what we did was, for the past 15 years, was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically. 
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?" 
You're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is. 
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate, or whether it was just sheer stupidity, which is what the defense lawyers thought — (Laughter) — when they heard me say, "Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you, three to four feet away, and I want the passenger to extend his hand 
I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s. 
There's another sign that we need pit crews, and that's the unmanageable cost of our care. 
That's from real data. 
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey, and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo, Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends. 
I'm suffering from gallery fatigue. 
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship. 
How could it be possible that we would do this? 
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. 
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid, is really very deadening, and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. 
And so, in fact, what we've done is we, humanity, have started abstracting out. 
And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. 
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. 
And then we give him a reason for sitting. 
Thank you. 
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing: if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. 
It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed, and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers. 
(Laughter) (Applause) That's a tough one. 
I may fall, but I do not die, for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life. 
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. 
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher. 
And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology, and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this, this is the new green graffiti. 
As an absolute connection, it only works one way. 
And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the "Feed Bag" -- which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. 
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. 
Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS. 
I'm probably going to jump. 
I'm totally clueless. 
Sometimes very small investments can release enormous, infinite potential that exists in all of us. 
I'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize. 
At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing. 
Rughal: There must be something we can do. 
We have this gene defect in our mind. 
(Applause) So we're building these buildings. 
But I was interested in another definition of technology. 
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that's a foreign object -- we want that out. 
And look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men. 
So obviously I Googled for it. 
And after I came out of the closet, when she continued to say it, it made me furious. 
These effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. 
You could even get your own hive if you want. 
And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited. 
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since 2008. 
I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way, but I have the potential. 
And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter. 
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time. 
In the dotted red line, we show what the adoption would be in the random people, and in the left-hand line, shifted to the left, we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network. 
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this. 
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime. 
I know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love, but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another. 
And that's what we're doing with the ocean. 
It's been a major trending topic. 
We've seen under the sea, three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future. 
But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like? 
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. 
So let me narrow the choices down to two. 
The poorest congressional district in America, the most migratory community in America, we can do this. 
A nose, that's okay. No, you have an expectation of what you're going to see. 
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints -- importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it -- and we take them underwater. 
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca," but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first. 
CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken. 
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me, and it is able to achieve the action that I want. 
If you had to choose, which would you rather have: the common disease or the rare disease? 
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. 
We're moving towards persistent identity. 
So what can we do about this? 
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline. 
Again, a social network, but now we color the people yellow if they're happy and blue if they're sad and green in between. 
So in other words, they worked out, in this mindless sort of evolutionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they were, so that that way of writing it down could get copied. 
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence. 
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria, which is all good. 
Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system, Valles Marineris. 
And he finally asked, "Can I see those?" 
And yet I forget about it all the time. 
In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. 
Islam actually, as a monotheistic religion, which defined man as a responsible agent by itself, created the idea of the individual in the Middle East and saved it from the communitarianism, the collectivism of the tribe. 
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about? 
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure. 
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us. 
The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken. 
Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development. But they're not there. 
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic, there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic -- if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him -- it's a multicentric epidemic. 
Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. 
The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet, so those invoices don't get issued. 
That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. 
You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people. 
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. 
And it's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource. 
Understandably, the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs, such as long-term daily medications. 
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome. 
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it, and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. 
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book. 
CA: That's very cool. 
You see the skeletal structure of it. 
My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat. 
So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. 
With enough users, maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action, containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. 
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl. 
Babcock &amp; Wilcox that make nuclear reactors, here's an integral fast reactor. 
I wanted to make a sequel. 
This is a piece of property in Brentwood. 
Explore. 
Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend? Sure. 
We have to change now. 
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated, slowly and painfully. 
In America, the primary locus of choice is the individual. 
But it also tells us something about policy. 
(Applause) When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. 
I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex, elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. 
How does this work? Well, two ways. 
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz." 
What happens with that? 
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data. 
That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. 
And finally, the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad. 
You hear about it on your television sets. 
In that time, Novocure's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body. 
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography. 
Crisis. Death. Disaster. 
Not how do you build one car, but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population? 
I've been in a painful journey. 
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) It's really quite an honor to be here tonight, and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. 
Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. 
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. 
And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones. 
They are just going alone! (Applause) And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know. 
And then, turning round to the other side of the equation, I have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with PowerPoint presentations. 
Without it, we literally can't interface with others. 
So I thought, well they like to play games. 
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. 
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. 
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations. 
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. 
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge. 
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house. 
They stop complex life from existing. 
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. 
There's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family. 
It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. 
And we're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world, which is producing the most high-carbon greenhouse gas emitting oil in the world. 
There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint, Michigan. 
We don't have that. So that's one problem. 
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. 
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week? 
(Laughter) You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say." 
We live where we want to be -- at least in the West. 
They behaved just like the children. 
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means. 
Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation-state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization-state. 
You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court, because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy, which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture. 
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion. 
(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry. 
Fission. 
I just signed. 
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat, and in a few minutes we will try this, and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor. 
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies. 
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly, he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma, so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly. 
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain. 
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is, connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network, and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate. 
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons. 
Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses, and take advice from them, design advice. 
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey, that would be bad. 
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities. 
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. 
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress." 
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you don't make a lot of money. 
Even though it pricked my conscience then, I could not, or rather I did not tend to her or assist her, because I was busy building my real estate company. 
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment, to start to delve deeper into the body. 
The interesting thing was, though, that the sysadmins were able to fix it, but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off. 
Froogle lets you search shopping information, and Blogger lets you publish things. 
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology, and that's another important point. 
And no other species does anything at all like it. 
But here's what really perplexed me. 
Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims? 
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself." 
So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth. 
(Laughter) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky. 
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. 
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science. 
These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. 
The road turned into the jungle. 
And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish. 
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. 
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way." 
Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment, and look at all the talks together. 
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. 
And if you wonder why this is interesting at all, you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because it's a country which is strictly divided between the sexes. 
I'm going to wave through the Kinect here and take control, and now I'm going to reach out and I'm going to touch a star, and when I do, it will play the sentence that generated that star. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You know, we have to go through that. 
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth. 
How many people knew of Lula before today? 
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today? 
If you're not passionate about your own company, why on Earth should anyone else be passionate? 
SB: No, not without. 
Which is a little good, but not very much good. 
(Laughter) We made mixed tapes; they remix music. 
(Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future? 
We should pull it forward. 
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials. 
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile, around 80,000. 
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. 
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world, that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 -- that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty; the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. 
All my creations really start on small drawings, which I have thousands of, and it's my way of just thinking. 
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored. 
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account. 
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable. 
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square, and people had tried for years to make changes. 
They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that, and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day. 
Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach, I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. 
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. 
[Science for the public good] Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain. 
But I've talked about education and employment. 
Secondly, it breaks down a lot. 
And they should be treated with love and respect. 
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those "non-essential genes." 
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. 
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore. 
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. 
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy. 
They wiped her bindi off her forehead. 
So we always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. 
I know when I'm licked." 
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik. 
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. 
There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content. 
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs. 
The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. 
I hopped into his car, and off we went through the remaining layers of security. 
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. 
(Laughter) FG: Anyway, the Siza thing. 
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. 
So, that's where we were at the end of about 15 months. 
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. 
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that? 
If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star, you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere, because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. 
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now. 
Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our 200-year plan to really curate our digital legacy. 
And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos? 
It's not happening, and it's time. 
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way." 
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer. 
Thank you so much, my fellow citizens. 
There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. 
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology. 
This is a terrible thing, that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf." 
You see the red glow in their eyes, which is the reflection of the flashlight. 
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. 
And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment, they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment. 
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more. 
This has led to a common understanding of our situation, namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril. 
The other thing that the early man invented was fire. 
And so, what technology gives us, over the long term, over the sort of extended evolution -- from the beginning of time, through the invention of the plants and animals, and the evolution of life, the evolution of brains -- what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences: It's increasing diversity, it's increasing options, it's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms. 
And that 0.8 is the big challenge. 
And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline. 
When I was growing up in Nigeria -- and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general, but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from -- there were always rites of passage for young men. 
How to measure, if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small, so those planets are tectonically dead, there cannot be life. 
So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space. 
The moon was closer; things were different. 
These examples give new hope, new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar. 
It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti. 
It goes all the way back to Aristotle. 
(Music) (Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are, we are makers. 
But, as you can see, the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure. 
People seem to love it. 
I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you. 
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. 
I thank you. 
We all know the short answer. 
I want to talk to you about fear. 
Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. 
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project, and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. 
It's your oil, not ours." 
He saw them. 
And equally important is the negative version -- "Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you." 
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. 
We then have gone on since to present for [the] international community, for governments, for local governments and for business and for people, for you and me, a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year, which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. 
But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. 
And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder? 
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous. 
Thank you. 
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work, such as installation artist, architect, commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations. 
It could happen in learning time scales. 
If we can put those two together in a safe space, get them to work together, we can deliver public goods right now, or in extremely short supply. 
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not. 
But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach-churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment, it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. 
And I really think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets, and I think that's really exciting, compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event. 
So, at TED, we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. 
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us, but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. 
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. 
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. 
The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. 
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. 
And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. 
Is it "still" permissible? 
And they know that they're part of a whole, that they depend on other people. 
That day, I realized I had an unwelcome, uninvited, new life partner. 
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast. 
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board, and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase, and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. 
Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something. 
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience. 
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain. 
There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics. 
Less than one week after, this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering. 
Is it fun? Is it playful? 
LG: Oh. 
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. 
The question then is, how do we tap into this? 
It is in telling the story of the mathematics. 
As such, it deserves no compassion, it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom, and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness." 
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. 
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect, and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life." 
So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. 
And we started, and for the next 53 hours, it was an intense, unforgettable life experience. 
It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women. 
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. 
That was it. 
It is the capital of the country, and it took 23 years to build, which is something they seem to be very proud of over there. 
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it. 
Now, the third system is product-service systems. 
He was a great storyteller. 
The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it, but that's a basic overview of how pollination works. 
(Applause) We are today talking about moral persuasion. 
And social play is part of what we're about here today, and is a byproduct of the play scene. 
I look. Both are of the male sex. 
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip. 
It's perfume coming from the inside out. 
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? 
(Laughter) Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help. 
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: What will happen next? 
And you make a plan. 
So they asked them at the beginning, "Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?" 
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective. 
"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. 
Now, I haven't met these particular students, but I've met students like them. 
So, we do something a little bit more serious. 
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. 
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer. 
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long. 
Today, stories continue to transcend borders. 
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. 
But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming. 
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell, you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell. 
But this story only happened a few years ago. 
He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy" with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance. 
It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. 
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up? 
And you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size, but always within a, kind of, controlled limit, an envelope of change. 
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision. 
Now the parents are really alarmed. 
RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually -- we're working with the government on it. 
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness. 
But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market? 
So the climbers passed him by, and Beck lay there for a day, a night and another day, in the snow. 
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter) But [German]. 
And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet, but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. 
And they go, "What, what do you mean?" 
Here was one of the first things they built. 
But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. 
They don't just deliver us sermons on this. 
Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach, unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby, we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. 
Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. 
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out. 
(Laughter) And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America -- 15 billion annually. 
Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES, started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures. 
Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. 
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. 
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead, and therefore, he was a maverick. 
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology, helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster, more cheaply and more effectively. 
So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. 
Music must be the thing for Derek. 
You see the whole big picture? 
So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. 
In less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us. 
"So Daddy could be gone." "Yes." 
And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot. 
And he, the positive soul that he is, said, "No, this is just a hiatus, a hiatus during the treatment, and you'll get back to doing what you do best." 
(Laughter) CA: It depends what the answer is though. 
You need a pressure suit. 
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. 
The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists. 
To go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said. 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. 
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated -- tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. 
Sooner or later, sooner or later, the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow. 
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there. 
Brent Lawson: Happy to be here. 
This may be one of those myth-buster things that we'll have to clear up here, in a minute. 
(Laughter) According to this self-help book, guys brains are like waffles; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. 
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. 
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them. 
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there, there is a huge need. 
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long. 
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. 
In the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area. 
And I think I can see a few eyes rolling. 
So quite often you load water for ballast. 
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents. 
So what we do is we give you another word, one for which the system does know the answer. 
Because this book is actually a prayer book. 
Military collect weapons, and depression stays intact. 
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age." 
And then I thought -- (Applause) But here's the thing. 
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life. 
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there. 
And over the ensuing few years, there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2. 
So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's "Magic Flute" but answers to questions much more critical to its survival. 
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much. 
And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left. 
It took about 10 years to put this project together. 
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. 
Traditionally, the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. 
So to illustrate that question, let me give you two countries. 
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth, where you can fly to any address. 
We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. 
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them. 
But the way that our institutions are designed, in our rather 18th-century, centralized model, is to channel the flow of values through voting, once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this era of social media, for us to actually express our values. 
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation, existed in the 12th century. 
This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. 
And what about sleep? 
Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves, women, along with young girls and boys, some as young as seven years old, are forced to entertain the clients, encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. 
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. 
The Third World is connected, we are connected. 
And this is the terrain it appears over, and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. 
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that's 74,000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills, closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago. 
Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell, there are lots of little bumps on that shell. 
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. 
Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles. 
It's plenty. 
Now, if you're on the equator here -- that's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line -- the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve, it's the area in this space here. 
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work, or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that, so long as we use it and we move on. 
Largely through globalization, a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. 
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. 
Well, of course, I wanted to build models. 
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free. 
What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary, more insidious and more pervasive crisis, which is the crisis of agency, which is what to do. 
Thank you very much. 
I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that. 
But in general, this is what we've got. 
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. 
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black-tie affair. 
♫ And for everything you've done, you know I'm bound; ♫ ♫ I'm bound to thank for it ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la la ♫ (Clapping) ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la ♫ ♫ And you ♫ ♫ Now you've been so kind and ... ♫ Curb the enthusiasm, just a little bit. 
And so, what did they test her for? 
Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions, which is food. 
But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure. 
And after about three months, the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch. 
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways. 
And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12. 
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. 
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening, and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever. 
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens. 
So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only -- everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. 
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves. 
And he used it to design this solar array. 
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. 
I think that we should be proud of it. 
Somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "Oops." 
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image. 
So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi. 
There's a relationship between the old and the new; the new emerges from the context of the old. 
You can do it immediately, right? 
(Laughter) Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound, the force of ultrasound. 
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent. 
I had to bring it in. 
And then it no longer matters what you look like, where you come from, or what you do for a living. 
And he came up home from a run one day and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling." 
The Internet is a fantastic resource for business, for political expression, for art and for learning. 
Like I care, right? 
Corruption. 
It's about two-thirds built out right now. 
Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum, a large slum, which had caught fire. 
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today, the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. 
Do not interfere. 
So, their entire year has been cut in half. 
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things. 
Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife. 
She's only 12 years old, and she's not dazzled by anything." 
They group together, they form institutions. 
So how do we diagnose that conversation? 
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. 
Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder, which is sugar. 
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges. 
And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet, which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction. 
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get? 
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again." 
So, magnificent creature, isn't it? 
(Applause) PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven. 
Young people, I think, my Harvard Business School students, are getting it. 
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit, as well. 
Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay. 
(Laughter) The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this, having things like this, doing things like this, with economies that are growing like this, not realizing that entropy produces things like this, this, this and this. 
These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etching in this case. 
He's sniveling. 
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture. 
These are just some examples. 
It's connected; it all hooks into each other. 
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. 
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple. 
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves, and thought about ourselves. 
And all sorts of people, moving up to the First World War and between the wars, tried to solve this problem, and nearly everybody came up short. 
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy. 
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers? 
But well before my imagination was my vocation, my imagination saved my life. 
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin. 
Two years go by. 
I have no more reason to blame myself. 
Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening. 
You are going to take the photos. 
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. 
So as long as activism is that simple, it's pretty easy to get away with. 
(Laughter) "Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953." 
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts. 
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones. 
I've had some great meals at cafeterias. 
And therefore tradition becomes more important, not less important. 
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing, and we're going to build it all right. 
This is MobSoft, one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned, and an interesting thing about MobSoft is the 50-percent owner of this posted a job advert, and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier. 
You only know if you try it. 
It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system. 
This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning. 
Well, the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces. 
Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. 
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all. 
I was very much involved in it, but then turned my attention to other phenomena. 
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. 
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks, and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building, and they sell toys, giant microbes. 
And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. 
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors. 
My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is: Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. 
Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. 
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival. 
That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound, and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains. 
So, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim. 
So basically, kids of all ages, like us. 
And so let me lead you through how we can do this. 
And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency. 
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent. 
Under the Cotonou Agreement, formerly known as the Lome Convention, African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market. 
Well there's a little bit more to it than that. 
So given that we know and should believe -- because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant, I mean, it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever. 
Let's talk about the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth in the world today. 
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool. 
Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. 
Columns are architectural archetypes. 
The first day it was just wild. And then we said, "Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one, but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in. 
(Applause) I teach chemistry. 
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we? 
So if I want to see the back side, I can flip and see from behind. 
And at that particular point in time, this was one of the few solitary computers. 
(Laughter) I didn’t know about the environment then. 
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers, though we eventually got it packaged into a small box. 
So if you really care about strengthening families, you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality, who are working on raising the minimum wage, who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives. 
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. 
Who's in charge? 
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms. 
Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something, which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists. 
And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy. 
Here's a way of transporting water. 
And that began with open-source software. 
When we change the way we see ourselves, others will follow. 
They're really approaching, in many cases surpassing, the ability of the human mind. 
So we got one of these robots. 
And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish." 
I need a little bit off." 
The county seat is Windsor. 
Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure. 
And we do like a cocktail or two. 
So I actually designed this back in 2003. 
You see, you can now commit more crime as well. 
There was a time when you played cricket, you played timeless test matches, when you played on till the game got over. 
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains. 
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative systems of open-source software, of file sharing, of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr, but there are actually stories about this from all over. 
You could, if you want, compare this to, on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack, where you have dead tissue in the heart, versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it. 
Except, maybe we do. 
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view. 
But they'd heard some frightening rumors. 
You see the idea? 
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier. 
So four of us went. 
We have an annual gathering of people, and that is called Life in Space. 
And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows. 
Secret of the trade. 
And finally, there's a profound social impact. 
I've decided that, for me at least, I don't have a big enough head. 
This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system. 
But what to do with this privilege? 
We have three main groups. 
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. 
Some journeyed to the moons and planets. 
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet, and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully. 
This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias. 
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. 
Thank you. 
We might spend time with people we don't even like because it's somehow interesting. 
(Applause) It's a great pleasure to be here. 
Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash. 
What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say, "No. 
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. 
You can't -- okay. 
I want to create an object like you and me. 
We also have things about how to make the bun. 
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God. 
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m. 
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference. 
Imagine a very popular person in the social network -- like a party host who has hundreds of friends -- and a misanthrope who has just one friend, and you pick someone at random from the population; they were much more likely to know the party host. 
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree? 
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. 
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. 
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. 
That's the politest description I have for them. 
That's what really made them change their behavior. 
Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens. 
Hope brought me to America. 
And we care about right and wrong. 
To build all this, we destroy a lot. 
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. 
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross: you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form. 
It's basically efficient brainstorming, and when I visited David to learn about his research, he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method: PowerPoint. 
The cancer cells, small, round and rapidly dividing, grew these arms and extensions. 
And that's what we did. 
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. 
It's a non-spiking cell. 
The last. 
DH: I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. 
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. 
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children? 
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here. 
The technologies do not exist to do that. 
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case, but in advance. There was no legal precedent, no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this. 
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling." 
I want to talk about the election. 
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict. 
And I said, "That's a great idea." 
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, "This map sucks!" 
You find these, for example, in fish oil. 
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food, but we, as a nation, have to start thinking about consuming, growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals. 
(Laughter) I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. 
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws. 
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier. 
We can do to the next harvest. 
But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now. 
According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins, and documented in the book "Good to Great," it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. 
And in addition to that, we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future, a say we haven't even really started to hear yet -- China, India, Russia, South Africa and Benki's own Brazil, where Benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution. 
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. 
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge. 
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. 
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science. 
At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate. 
Now it's about something else, but it's equally profound. 
So something which is trash, which is choking all the seabirds, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. 
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India. 
They could carry on without us. 
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. 
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. 
What about the water?" 
BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals. 
What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting? 
And every single morning I appreciate life. 
And then we back off, you know, from that point. 
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no, procreation is not the only purpose of marriage; what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment? 
Sometimes there's a lot of information. 
And that gap is very intimidating. 
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments. 
Now some hard stuff. 
And there is a way the world both envisions food, the way the world writes about food and learns about food. 
She wasn't miserable at all. 
There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology. 
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals." 
It's just about being you and being cool with that. 
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength, in order to make these really fine shapes, like this deer. 
(Laughter) (Applause) When I was little, my mother used to say, "The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world. 
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range. 
When I was a kid, I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this. 
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy. 
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic that I think we can live in a waste-free world. 
Épuise, right? 
And this is what one of these experiments looks like. 
And then what we get is our first mapping. 
Why don't they just keep on going? 
But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms, so that we could read the page from before and after. 
Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp. 
The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter. 
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it. 
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. 
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus, but in reality, it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. 
And forgive the complicated diagram. 
Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community. 
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. 
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. 
I made this series of works. 
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. 
Put it on a chip, enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care, anywhere in the world. 
It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine, and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward. 
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20. 
One is the reward system, and that's fed by the chemical dopamine. 
And yet, the impossible is happening. 
I was never caught. 
And finally, medicine. 
And on a particularly dark night of December of 2004, I sat down with my family, and I said that I had become very disillusioned. 
Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos, and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?" 
And he said, "This genetic resource," -- and I'll never forget the words -- "stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine." 
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we? 
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long. 
But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story, about the story of this country that you're all here in today. 
Instead you get near it. 
Today, it's here. 
In the Second World War, too, the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain. 
Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. 
You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology. 
This is a typical view of a favela in Rio. 
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop, when I point to them, right. Point, say stop. 
I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family, and they made together the decision to transfer this land to Léila and myself. 
So, normally, I never do any research at all. 
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out. 
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects. 
He had the favor of God with him. 
And I thought, "You know, I wonder what my soleus muscle is?" 
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord." 
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. 
I'm watching who's watching me. 
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny. 
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the 11 million college students in this country? 
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data. 
Are you ready? You look a little nervous. 
Computers! What about computers? 
Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again? 
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. 
Or the information's added on at the back, like that little girl's drawing that I showed you. 
and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster. 
In awareness of the inner conversation. 
The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300, at the low end, to about 2,100 metric tons. 
And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products. 
For those who do return back to the countryside, they find themselves very welcome locally, because with the knowledge, skills and networks they have learned in the cities, with the assistance of the Internet, they're able to create more jobs, upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market. 
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases. 
Thank you very much. 
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82, he said to himself and to everybody else, I will never use the word "unacceptable" again. 
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge. 
But there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet. 
That's the system. 
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative. 
That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone. 
They have to be precisely lathed. 
We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things.

Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. 
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed. 
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?" 
So much for the wonder, now for the mystery. 
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. 
There was the bomb, and there's now. 
Baby. Baby. 
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. 
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans, are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it. 
So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds. 
But the stage is crowded. 
And so indeed, there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad. 
There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram, in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden. 
So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. 
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. 
You might find this strange, but in my family we have different accents. 
Because if you double one percent seven more times, which is exactly what happened, you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time. 
Bad Pentagon, bad!" 
We didn't see a single shark. 
We exist yet. I was last week at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation, and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups of Indians that are not contacted yet. 
Where are the interior sound designers? 
What is the ideal balance of human and machine? 
(Laughter) Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. 
It's solvable, not by being a Democrat, not by being a Republican. 
Thank you very much. 
Now what I like about this video is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead. He had a strong lead. 
We've got to show them this thing. 
The same thing happens. 
A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance, where at any given point in time, with any single person, I am both close and distant from that individual, all as a function of what I need to do right now. 
And if you think about it, the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce, and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve. 
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals, was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds. 
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments. 
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming. 
For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect." 
The saboteur is there, and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War." 
And since then, I've been painting all over the place. 
and passing her son to someone through a window. 
(Laughter) Okay. 
You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. 
So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive. 
Nature does something much more elegant. 
We're obsessed with morality as social creatures. 
These are people who are productive agents in the economy. 
Other studies have shown this as well. 
That began with Afghanistan, and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly, a decision was made through the technology of democracy -- again, notice, not a perfect technology -- but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war -- this time, a war in Iraq. 
It's been running for about a year and a half. 
I've written about this idea before, and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. 
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. 
So oil is playing a less significant role every year. 
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint. 
Mozart was the same way. 
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house, Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days, two days through Masai land.

That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. 
But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the arctic. 
That's when love begins. That's when structure begins. 
Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive, and that's why people listen to him. 
Let me show you what you could do right now. 
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. 
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world. 
And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. 
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit. 
Now these chimpanzees are using tools, and we take that as a sign of their intelligence. 
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.

When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything" or else "playing." 
Why is water important? Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. 
One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is, is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago, much less data on things like the ozone layer. 
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. 
Most people choose to lease. 
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them. 
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness. 
They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft. 
You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing, but let's talk about selfish things. 
And the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations? 
But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests. 
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.

And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it. 
Everything that is allowed, every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room, would eventually be obtained. 
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time. 
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. 
The second is, "You can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old." 
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter. 
All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality. 
Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union, and the data referred to 1989. 
This is a great technology. 
Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building? 
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. 
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another, kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis, sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from, no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol, which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores, basically, had heart problems, and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.

And in terms of climate change, is something that is not actually feasible. 
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out, and I want to throttle them.

I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. 
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services. 
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate. 
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. 
When we think about why we hear, we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren, although clearly that's an important thing.

Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many. 
(Laughter) I think it doesn't matter. 
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?" 
This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education. 
Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope? 
This is a pretty involved process; it took us about four and a half years. 
This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. 
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us. 
It just didn't work out for you. 
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them, because of their unpleasant side effects. 
(Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. 
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.

That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it. 
But we're also unimpressed by authority, because it's so easy to contrive. 
The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments, the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time. 
With the service economy, it is about improving quality. 
To love everybody, he sometimes did not see the very closest ones, and that is inevitable for men of his stature. 
It's not going to be easy. 
Actually, for creating social change, we need to bring in the expertise in order to make this work. 
Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal. 
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology. 
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion? 
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf. 
And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days, these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely. 
And so, because you don't know, you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein -- say a prayer -- accessed his equations, the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself, outside the universe. 
Well, we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared, but this threat could reappear at any time. 
Britain, America, Japan, South Africa, the Congo. 
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos. 
Thanks. 
Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. 
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think, "What could we do to make Lesterland better?" 
But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function. 
If we build all these nuclear power plants, all that waste is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands, of trucks and trains, moving through this country every day. 
Today, 6,800 of those are extinct, no longer to be seen again. 
He put his hand on the throttle. 
He said, "If all the insects disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years. 
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. 
So my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books. 
He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. 
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music -- for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. 
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before. 
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. 
And when you see mountains, remember mountains can be moved. 
It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. 
It is outrageous. 
And you can see, he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. 
We may put him away for life, but we watch him clinically. 
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort, you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. 
This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers? 
Chef: For cream? 
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed." 
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. 
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box." 
In fact, though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice, we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. 
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap, a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV. 
it's good for a nice suntan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body. 
And you know, the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. 
Two years later, he was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
They have enough income for three families. 
What's your vision for the next phase of this? 
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat. 
You know, we have to change it. 
Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world. 
So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day? 
Although I worked very long hours, I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. 
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around. 
This is a serious business. 
And Zuckerberg said, "A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa." 
Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades, have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots. 
Now I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing. 
He was only three at the time. 
Now, millions of abalone every year make this shell. 
Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1:12. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Depending on the context, depending on the outcome, choose your paradigm. 
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on." 
You can put them down, essentially out of the way. 
It's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity in the global transport system. 
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats, right, to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff. 
And they came down on the side of open publication, which is the right approach -- we've briefed the White House, we've briefed members of Congress, we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances. 
(Applause) Audience: Shake. 
Our special is tracking cookie. 
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld." 
We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. 
I want, really, to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford. 
Up come the dolphins, and drop off the rope, yay. Wow. 
Can't you move them over to a place where there's less of a risk?" 
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. 
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value; it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture. 
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out, just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students, and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well, fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers, it probably wouldn't get published in a journal. 
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know. 
And then when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?" 
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven, biologically successful model. 
(Laughter) Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there, are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. 
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together. 
And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing, and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you. 
Watson was in fact listening to very low-frequency radio emissions caused by nature. 
Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. 
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know. 
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. 
Women gave poison to their babies, and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. 
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all. 
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves, it becomes a movement. 
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity, a lot of ways to describe mechanisms. 
We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough, that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining. 
And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster. 
That's where we have the fast population growth. 
I started thinking about -- when I was in college, especially as a blind person, doing a research paper was a major undertaking. 
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine. 
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. 
That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. 
How does it really work? It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless, metaphorically speaking. 
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail. 
Each letter here is one of these digits. 
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros. 
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull, I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station, to the route of the train. 
(Video) (Music) Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy. 
For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other. 
But that was one of the reasons. 
And I thought up a lot of ideas. 
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go? 
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. 
But where the DMCA was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer, we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine, and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. 
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them, we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces, because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there. 
So, really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. 
As a result, we’d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time -- but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. 
This person is not doing anything violent, but they just won't do what we want them to. 
During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides, and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old, we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq. 
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. 
How are they different, and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China, or at large, the world? 
On paper the country was doing great. 
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did." 
In the world that we are creating very quickly, we're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction, and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs. 
Now, not only do we have much more education, and much of that education is scientific, and you can't do science without classifying the world. 
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening? 
An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars, you can "Finally, love your friends love your body, love your life, online and with avatars." 
I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood, and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. 
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing. 
It didn't look like it was going to work. 
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure -- but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate? 
The changes are happening. They're very visible. 
It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens. 
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class. 
They say it's denial. 
The Tasmanian devil has shown us that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease, but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction. 
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. 
But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call. 
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance, or destiny, or what? 
I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented, and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin. 
Good news: Chariot's coming. 
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks. 
(Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. 
The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this. 
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. 
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries. 
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. 
You look at the image and you see that, and you drop the whole thing. 
Their culture isn't working in schools, and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. 
Well, I'm not going to explain this equation, but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject. 
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. 
And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side. 
They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status. 
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. 
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true. 
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect -- it was called Natal -- I was inspired, and I thought for a moment, maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling, to create a character which seemed alive, which noticed me, that could look me in the eyes and feel real, and sculpt a story about our relationship. 
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. 
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time. 
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Well done, well done. 
I mean, is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen, in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there, or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another? 
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor. 
The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars. 
(Laughter) I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab]. 
Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography, sculpture, painting and installation. 
She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously, wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty. 
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter, so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view. 
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them, so they pick up these kinds of activities. 
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. 
Did this really happen? 
That was the origin of the word "bug." 
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika. 
This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. 
But you can relax, because it takes half an hour before it works, so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. 
Let me introduce him. 
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. 
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting. 
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence. 
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life. 
That's a statement about vision. 
The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males. 
Because there is different types of design. 
I don't know where to start, where to finish it. 
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna, in his lumbar cord, and filled out the IRBs and did all this work, and I never really knew. 
They'll have cities with no energy and no food. 
(Laughter) And everybody says it's because I have a little museum. 
So if our engine's broken, guess what? 
And this actually shows that printing. 
Within the next few years, many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. 
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." 
It's a whole week long of excitement. 
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. 
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on, they recover their developmental delays, and go on to lead normal, happy lives. 
And it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works. 
And this is how you make a valve. 
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship. 
(Laughter) In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth -- which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday. 
It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. 
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in. 
The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. 
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it. 
Because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position. 
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ... 
And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. 
One problem: waste handling and unemployment. 
It's disgusting. 
It's called Opto-Isolator. 
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. 
And we're trying to not fall in the water. 
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again. 
But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there. 
This is the boy in me getting lucky again. 
They're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone. 
(Music) (Beatboxing) Thank you. 
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities, and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day, so you can never forget that that day, you lived. 
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. 
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother. 
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else. 
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. 
I know a thing or two about hospitals. 
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV-positive mothers. 
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said, "What's the problem?" 
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. 
(Applause) So I'm a city planner, an urban designer, former arts advocate, trained in architecture and art history, and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient, how America can be healthier, and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. 
Yes. What if ... 
The first is: Take core positions with your client. 
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. 
So you have to be careful with hacker. 
It was done by a guy named Goose. 
Here is the critical difference between these: LOLcats is communal value. 
(Laughter) So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. 
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news, which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. 
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was? 
So, we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. 
Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. 
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit, and we now, being the top organism on this planet, are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. 
Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief. 
A is my office, B is the place where the duck hit the glass, and C is from where I watched it. 
Everyone has to respond to the modern world. 
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA. 
Because you see with Duolingo, people are actually learning with real content. 
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could." 
And that was just a small percentage of the dead. 
By the way, years later, my social worker said that I should never have been put in there. 
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation. 
And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. 
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. 
The first problem that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is, how do you create good jobs in America in a global economy? 
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms -- the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival. 
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years, so I turned around and I looked and I said, "God, who's saying what I’m thinking?" 
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. 
In two words, we cook. 
I heard thousands of stories, and I have to tell you, there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body -- when she left home. 
You see the glacier flowing in from the right, dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour. 
These people have designs for your resource, and this is what you see? 
Well, there are many reasons, and you heard some of them in the short talk today. 
You go to a black church, their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience, so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes, and then he takes a pause, and he says, "Oh my gosh, they're not quite paying attention." 
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you -- how come there are so many galaxies? 
The problem was just that in the material, mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. 
But you know, everything is relative. 
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff. 
First overtime, second. 
Now, you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain. 
Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -- which have set curtain times, set venues, attendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like -- simply cannot meet. 
Thank you. 
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. 
And in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating. 
I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space. 
The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this: "Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium." 
They seemed to speak to me. 
Thank you very much. 
(Laughter) And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story. 
And I brought women into the laboratory, and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?" 
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. 
But for the first time in history, we have the technology; we have the know-how; we have the cash; we have the life-saving drugs. 
Second, I call this the mixer. 
So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this. 
And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world, and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. 
I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics, math has come into the picture. 
New materials that can make water, new materials that can make fuel cells work better, new materials that catalyze chemical reactions, that cut pollution and so on. 
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere." 
Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. 
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends. 
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant. 
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature. 
And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource. 
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? 
Online videos and social networking ... 
And I often think of the raw and the refined. 
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways. 
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals, but -- (Laughter) they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. 
More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean. 
And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change. 
You're much too young to help. 
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger. 
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m." 
Thank you. 
In Manitoba, this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg, and this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site. 
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. 
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours. 
So before I start, I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine, because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today. 
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. 
So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out, so we did what anybody would do in our situation: we asked the Internet for help. 
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. 
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile." 
So we're really comparing apples to apples. 
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day. 
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution. 
We exercise these prior to implantation. 
It elevates MOOTW -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy, because that's how you're going to shrink that gap. 
I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew, and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. 
Women suffer from that disease. 
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. 
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. 
And this is very important, what I'm going to say. 
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. 
This consists of 400 square meters. 
So I thought, got to talk about that. 
This was the cover of Science, because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals, but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway, smaller raptors. 
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars, at least of that type. 
So speaking of love and the brain, there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love, who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together, the source of love and prosperity. 
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. 
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs, and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle, just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. 
It's been widely heralded. 
This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology. 
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world, and we're advising seven or eight different countries, or political groups, depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions. 
But there is such a need, you know? 
People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. 
But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow. 
When he was trading fours with me, improvising versus memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left. 
Video: (Music) DM: I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. 
Because we already have this [growth] in process. 
I think that this is a strange moment. 
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. 
One is improvements in basic services -- especially health, which is a disaster during conflict. 
They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working. 
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that. 
It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here. 
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean. 
And maybe we live in an endless universe. 
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play. 
And those bumps act like a magnet for water. 
So between his nightly treks to the theater, his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry, he found that form of play which carried him through his days. 
When people circle together, they generate a current. 
So this is how it works. 
The printers cost 800 bucks now. 
♫ And sit here cold? ♫ ♫ We will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ In lackluster ♫ ♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we've got ♫ ♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ And what of the wretched hollow? ♫ ♫ The endless in between? ♫ ♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫ ♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫ ♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫ 
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and he's an unbeatable example for young musicians in Latin America and the world. 
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. 
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality. 
My work actually took me through many countries, and showed me a great part of the world. 
There are drawbacks to this. 
What does that mean? Well, explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what's seen. 
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. 
They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. 
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. 
The work they did was very, very high art, and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit, and you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata" and the monumental "Einstein on the Beach." 
The project is part art and part science. 
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers. 
So that's it speeded up. 
So if human need is the place to start, and prototyping, a vehicle for progress, then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. 
Wha -- what do you do?" 
I moved out of the house, I got a job, I found a girl, I settled down -- and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song -- (Laughter) but life was pretty good. 
After the surgery, more friendly, more honest, less violent -- and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. 
And over time -- quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product, ready to take out of the machine and use. 
So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. 
In the summer, you go to the beach. 
It turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive. 
I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. 
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-espressos. 
And that really, really excites me. 
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms. 
You house is in a terrible state. 
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters]. 
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts. 
We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope. 
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them. 
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution, has got to go. 
One is it's got to do economic reform, not fuss about the political constitution. 
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane. 
Disclosure is so important to treatment, because again, people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. 
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets, even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money. 
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out. 
We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon. 
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said, "Elyn, you don't really understand: These people are psychotic. 
(Applause) Thank you so much. 
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. 
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling; it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. 
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000, it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time, was listed as a threatened species. 
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down. 
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. 
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period -- the birth of modern China. 
It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate. 
And all of that's great, and it's fine. 
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. 
They have increased the security of proprietors. 
This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. 
And what I was curious about -- because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case. 
That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day. 
You've probably seen something like this before. 
(Applause) It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen, and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire African continent. 
And you can start to get the best artistic directors, scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere. 
Yet I had that piece of paper. 
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences. 
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!) Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new. 
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer, the easiest answer, of course, is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. 
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS. 
First of all, scale, might. 
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season. 
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk. 
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around. 
That's almost the size of South America. 
I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements." 
That's just one example. 
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. 
I had to meet my love. 
Finally, you go to the emergency room. 
And none of the people or the animals, well, they all seemed oblivious of her. 
So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. 
There is no punishment on apostasy. 
Now, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion, and we get closer and closer to the underlying law, we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one, and with the next one. We write them out mathematically, and we see they use very similar mathematics. 
In the early 20th century, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the whole Middle East was colonized. 
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here, and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing, and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. 
So, in the course of your VC pitch, you have a very few minutes, and most VC pitches -- most angel pitches are about 15 minutes, most VC pitches should be less than half an hour. 
And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims, unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims, isn't a kind of nasty carping activity; it's socially useful, but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool. 
And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur. 
Here are the world wind resources. 
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well. 
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. 
And it's done in a very simple way: one just touches the base of the light, and on one side, you can mix the brightness, and on the other, the coloration of the light. 
(Laughter) It's clear to me." 
Very similar communities, very similar. 
You know what you are? A crocodile. 
There are many promised lands, depending on your station in society, depending on your stage of life. 
Now, I was 16. I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. 
Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago. 
It's a primitive conifer. 
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again, and as a result, working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts, we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press, with the strongest journalistic protections in the world, with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. 
Self-discipline: the most important factor for success. 
So I'm going to tell you a little story. 
Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way. 
When we started out on the milk project, and when I started out, I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. 
Isn't that terrific? 
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions, but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can't happen from outside, it has to come from within. 
Or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules, let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that, even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests, it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. 
What's going on underwater? 
I go, "He's got to be my driver." 
And I noticed that she was clowning around. 
And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force. 
Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said, "We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it." 
Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it. 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. 
When these mutate, they change their shape, and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore. 
This is a rugged and barren landscape, yet there are quite a few spiders here. 
And you can see in the context, it's just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes and another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon. 
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy, which is what they say is their objective. 
We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source, in this case the sun, with what we know about its target, Juliet. 
This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. 
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about, but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. 
And they get me to that nearby hospital, Cedars-Sinai, where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding, 45 units of blood -- which means full replacements of all the blood in me -- before they're able to staunch the flow. 
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on, they said, "We are working on global products." 
And so I'm watching him, and he slows down, and finally he stops. 
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano, I was firmly shoved off. 
It hasn't a clue. 
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark? 
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial. 
I'm a geologist, got out of school in '51, and I've been in the industry my entire life. 
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. 
Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby. 
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. 
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. 
"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices." 
The earth rotated, as did our management, (Laughter) and as if by divine intervention, things came together to help this revolution take shape. 
Now, that's not a new story. 
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized. 
The other day at the State of the Union speech, President Obama said, and I think we could all agree with this goal, "From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been the first to compete. 
It's one of my favorite bathing suits. 
This is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service, and every time a programmer uses Git to make any important change at all, creating a new file, modifying an existing one, merging two files, Git creates this kind of signature. 
And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous, but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole, down, down, down into chaos, and my life will never be the same again." 
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. 
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. 
One of their mothers said to us, "You know, we can't survive here, but we can't even seem to die either." 
It's doing something new. There's new things happening. 
(Laughter) Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity. 
You take about eight or so carbon atoms, about 20 hydrogen atoms, you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid: very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels. 
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. 
I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now. This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online, the generation that built something really and truly global. 
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans. 
They're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at, and they're actually getting so severe that they're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement. 
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s, this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought, kind of an average day, it looks something like this. 
Life happens. 
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men, both of whom I never knew. 
This box contains one billion people. 
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, "You know what? 
(Applause) I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem. 
But the project centers on the collision of order and disorder -- the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters. 
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And "God"? 
To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica." 
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row. 
So if you imagine a very, very big universe, an infinitely big universe, with randomly bumping into each other particles, there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states, and then they relax back. 
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall. 
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. 
And I did. 
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call. 
Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold, they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery, the still vast unknown, the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. 
We think this is universal. 
But, actually, that's practical. 
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. 
And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things, a big fat "no," everybody imagines I was devastated. 
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish. 
And I would also add, it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people, the whole world working for it. 
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for, because we have really misused the science in this. 
BF: There we go! 
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job. 
Even the Earth warps space around it. 
If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland. 
(Laughter) "Well, then blow yourself up. 
Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology. 
for the Cassini mission. 
So to do that, what you really need to do, you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics, and that's what proteomics is about. 
Famous for its diversity, human diversity. 
Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project. 
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see." 
So we had this little communication breakdown. 
You know, this is the mainframe. 
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume? 
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. 
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them. 
And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share. 
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district. 
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons. 
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems, or I really do solve their problems, because usually they seem to like it. 
And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in. 
And of course it's not going to look like that, but it is the crazy way I tend to work. 
That's the world I dream of. 
We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer. 
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. 
That's the one that John Locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law. 
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them? 
So it's a very solid, very well thought-out, very well grounded system, and it was a bottom-up system, and that was very important with this work, from the bottom up to secure this. 
And adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood, in our bone marrow, in our fat, our skin and other organs. 
And I promise to you, this was such an important moment in my career, when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas. 
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles -- an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle. 
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water, and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. 
And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. 
Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest. 
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no. 
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's. 
But then, I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have, which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified, respected, applied on a large scale. 
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours. 
What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need? 
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society. 
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. 
And one of the things that came out -- Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. 
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface. 
So this is altogether really, really interesting. 
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined -- about 100,000. 
One is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things. 
And countries with Islam as the majority religion, all of them almost had six to seven children per woman, irregardless of the income level. 
The students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen, how is it going to happen. 
The third component of Coke's success is marketing. 
(Laughter) But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy, and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on. 
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently, that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world, from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. 
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. 
Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. 
So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research. 
We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own. 
Here are some things, the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind: "A data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers." 
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in, and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world?" 
You move on. 
In any case, the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. 
There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place. 
Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex. 
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. 
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs. 
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday, so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. 
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem. 
That Fall of 1969, the Whole Earth Catalog came out. 
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels. 
Eighty-two dollars a night. 
The dodecahedron, it's dual. 
And sure, we could find fast food chains. 
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built. 
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations. 
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities, a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability. 
The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it. 
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. 
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior. 
It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings. 
And next year, she will come back. 
And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, you're going to be helpless. 
Thank you. 
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park." 
But no, I'm not. I own stocks. 
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this. 
So here's where the decisions come in. 
So I was -- you know, the door was being slammed in my face, it's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think, "What would the hero do in a movie, if I was writing this as a movie script?" 
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.

So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere. 
And those that were like that started to split and divide.

I have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much. 
TG: Well let me tell you, that child will be loyal, and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it. 
This fantastic news didn't happen by itself. 
Supermarkets are an easy place to start. 
(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata. 
That, and I will say this to the scientists, that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas. 
People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way, to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. 
Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons, which means you can attack any one individual, including all the people in this picture. 
It was just three days away. 
What this means is, even if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops, you couldn't match today's energy consumption. 
And we left, and I swore to myself, and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have to beg for anything in my life." 
We took a page out of XKCD, and we said, "Stand back. 
Voices 2, 3 and 4: With her? 
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things. 
How interesting. 
Instead, the context, the common ground activities, are the content on television that's driving the conversations. 
And these guys paint humongous paintings, and they look really good. 
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet. 
I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. 
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. 
It can be used in interesting ways. 
Luckily for us, we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. 
So in the WISE, 15 years ago, we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that." 
And I think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference. 
And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work. 
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs -- to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. 
So my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape? 
(Laughter) I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you? 
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair. 
It's not a movie. This is real life. 
The price? 
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. 
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time. 
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way. 
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one. 
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here. 
Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. 
Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. 
So they did that. 
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete. 
And the guy that made this, he made a slot machine out of Lego. 
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. 
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing. 
She came to my country and saw the importance of education. 
And at the time I went into the wind business, natural gas was nine dollars. 
(Applause) Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects, documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. 
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere, we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you'll start noticing, we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time. 
But for this examination, which is really hard, we have a problem. 
Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem. 
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, arrested, and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you, along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables. 
As one gets older? Very, very common. 
If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have -- that's gone off -- you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. 
How do we get out? 
We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity. 
So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ... 
We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city. 
So, I'm just going to show you a basic idea. 
You really want to protect them. 
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred. 
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. 
We're great! Who is not great? England!" 
I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small, and propels us to the world of the far future. 
When asked, "What words and images do you associate with choice?" 
And if I can get the camera -- okay, great -- you'll see, as I get sort of close... 
(Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) It took me three years to publish that. 
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow. 
And I worked in the healthcare industry. 
What started as very small, community rangers getting community involved, has now grown into something that we call conservancies. 
How do we explain this? 
Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans. 
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? 
because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share." 
She no longer danced. 
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago. 
So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. 
And when you get to that point -- I mean, these maladies don't care how many books you've written, how many companies you've started, that Nobel Prize you have yet to win, how much time you planned to spend with your children. 
I'd really loved being on board Kendal. 
If you want to address a group, you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press. 
TBP: I'm teasing. 
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities. 
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. 
And this probably is not what you're expecting. 
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not." 
And she got it, she said, "Okay, I see it's serious. 
(Laughter) SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. 
I want to show you now, to finish, just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction. 
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want: It's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue. 
And the population will double in one generation. 
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds, we need to construct neural maps. 
The translation of that is, could you help me build a foot? 
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building. 
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing, in which one's starting not just from raw computation, but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge. 
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work. 
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges, which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola. 
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger. 
So let's abandon the paradigm of let's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product. 
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon, nobody went to the polling stations. 
It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose, a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books. 
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward? 
And they told us one important thing: "You shall not beta-test." 
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. 
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?" 
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to is the work week. 
That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it. 
And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells, two cancer cells become four cancer cells, and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. 
And I thought, after all this atrocity, this is how human beings really pray. 
And [the] U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. 
Some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts, and it didn’t really work. 
And they made this into a game, initially. 
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya." 
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti. 
And we open up so many more possibilities. 
To which, he reported, most of them replied, "Hell no, I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there." 
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. 
It becomes impenetrable. 
And in South Africa, they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. 
When I was a young man, a young biologist in Africa, I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. 
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture: look where the other people are looking, and look where he is looking. 
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village. 
So what you see here is this is the design of the task. 
What happened? 
Now supposedly, oil taxes are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone. 
The world came. 
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2) They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. 
They are Attitude, Awareness and Authenticity. 
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet. 
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories. 
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out? 
They were the ones that didn't get paid. 
Then, when that gave out, I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those. 
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job. 
We will install panels on your roof. 
(Laughter) Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay? 
Such a service simply do not exist. 
And then I do it. 
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same, so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. 
I forgot my discretion. 
In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. 
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. 
It's always renewing and refreshing itself. 
What does this cause us? 
Why did they create a system like that? 
Now, I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this, because the grandmother, to me, appeared to be sort of the village wise woman, and the person everybody -- throughout the day, I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother. 
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it. 
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when, just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too, the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end, and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society, transformed from being a master into a servant, a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. 
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. 
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock. 
So, I decided I would try this for a month. 
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that. 
To put that number into perspective, here's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates. 
We need new models of what it means to be a leader. 
They had to slide me up on the wing, put me in the cockpit. 
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes, but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations. 
Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. 
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems. 
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds., you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry. 
CA: (Laughter) Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented? 
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. 
Now, I had two preconditions. 
She was born in the 1880's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world. 
But it's not just a symphony of perception. 
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. 
So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?" 
So I decided to give him a little support, and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. 
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with. 
Would it be crazy to know, 103 Gs. 
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell, and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks. 
So again, this is another one of those playful activities that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn. 
Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. 
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation, using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory. 
It's not really all that much data. 
I got into fish. 
And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered. 
There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? 
First, know your density. 
We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter. 
People going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome! 
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. 
Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman) That's what hurts! That's what hurts! (Breaking glass) Woman: Help me! 
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. 
What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not? 
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period. 
So here are a couple of examples. 
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible, to the forest floor, where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. 
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens. 
They are more American than anything else. 
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation. 
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children." 
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling." 
The people and the chairs are very different, but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same. 
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access, and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world. 
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life. 
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things. 
But it is a cruel, vicious, absolutely conscienceless -- I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) -- game that these people play. 
And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. 
Does it have the substance to do it? 
We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA. 
You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened. 
And around that time, I met John Gardner, who is a remarkable man. 
There's another thing. 
First of all, they learn the sound of their mothers' voices. 
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive, useful for headdresses, it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties, which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse. 
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty. 
Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. 
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn't secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like. 
Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others. 
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever. 
And a third question: Education. 
Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs. 
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this. 
They were seeing something magical. 
And I shared their bread and their prayer. 
And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. 
I recently sailed on the Hokulea, named after the sacred star of Hawaii, throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators. 
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places. 
So a little girl who you see just now, she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English, she said, "Well, apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease, we haven't understood anything else." 
You've won a prize! 
She was, of course, done up for the occasion, but this was a woman in great physical distress. 
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs. 
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs. 
Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. 
We would not know which way we were going, and why we are going where we're going. 
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. 
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 
So anyway, let's go with the red pill. 
A couple of principles: build small. 
We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand. 
They had no stone tools. 
And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance. 
There are different programs for graduate students, for executives at different companies. 
So let me show you a few objects. 
To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief. 
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul, the city I adore. 
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein, and we saw this huge shift. 
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant, which is an outpatient procedure. 
And the interaction is crucial. 
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket, you would have a transformative effect. 
And his thoughts made him reach for Katie. 
The dark blue line is how much the government spends. 
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. 
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go. 
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming. 
And finally, there's deforestation, and there's emission of methane from agriculture. 
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter) I teach high school math. 
Public services working well. 
I really don't care anymore. 
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation, surrealism has become banal, a shadow of its former self. 
In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school, we see enrollment rates about 50 percent girls and boys. 
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind, then there's a cycle that has been completed. 
The design comes from within. 
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm, from the current linear, command and control thinking, looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible, a much more adaptive approach, where we recognize that redundancy, both in social and environmental systems, is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. 
It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour. 
What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope. 
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant. 
But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits. 
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. 
That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground, entirely. 
He built a system. 
If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it? And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. 
But I guess the other thing to add is, if you do have employees, and you do have a company, I think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them, and you are trying to plan. 
Well in case you've ever wondered, this is what the Sun sounds like. 
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh. 
(Laughter) Personalized genomic massage anyone? 
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies. 
So the whole area's been stuck for a while, and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. 
It's not something that is a hobby of mine. 
I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. 
Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness. 
Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. 
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere. 
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs? 
It's only the last few hundred thousand years modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization. 
You see, it's a different picture. 
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) Ten years ago exactly, I was in Afghanistan. 
People over 50 don't go on blind dates. 
It's helping all of us to connect. 
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today seem the same, and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism. 
(Applause) I'm a medical illustrator, and I come from a slightly different point of view. 
And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms. 
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit, and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA. 
It remembers that it's cancer. 
It was like the foreman of the jury. 
Okay. 
I brought along with me an abalone shell. 
Come on -- everyone's got to get involved. 
So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words. 
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing, and that's to go out, protest, speak about the unspeakable, and talk shit. 
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED, and that's that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time, but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design, human-centeredness in an approach to design. 
He's an Australian Aboriginal elder, and he's also an artist. 
And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. 
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money. 
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where, really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones. 
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. 
For example, in polite requests, if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome," we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed. 
Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here. 
I discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide. 
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts. 
Instead, this element here is much more banal. 
And he was having a shower for 20 minutes. 
Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. 
Extremism became tolerance. 
So, we have a fulfillment problem. 
You're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. 
Those are political questions, economic questions, strategic questions. 
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it. 
And this is pretty easy biotechnology. 
So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. 
So I'm so proud of that. 
So what I'd like you to consider is: What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome, but they connect to genomes all across the planet? 
So, I tried going to the art store. 
We're terrible at models that span 80 years. 
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies. 
What would you say? 
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, "Hey, can you deliver the pizza?" 
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place. 
And how old was she when she died? 
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts. 
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. 
Can you believe it? 
Here's the new project: we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces. 
This is one from Oxford. 
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body. 
And I don't know why, but I remember the story. 
She got diabetes. Case closed. 
At the other end of the scale, the game Farmville that you may well have heard of, has 70 million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day. 
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall. 
It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day? 
On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo, and the one in culture was full of milk, the lovely red there is full of milk. 
In Tanzania last week, we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard. 
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets. 
The spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society. 
Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing. 
I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said, but don't forget the cities and the children. 
It's again, sun in the day and high humidity, and it was not comfortable. 
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. 
But actually when you look at female circumcision, you see that it has nothing to do with Islam, it's just a North African practice, which predates Islam. 
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others. 
It is the poorest county in the state. 
No one was a hero. No one was a hero. 
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said, "There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away." 
See, our pattern detection device, which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex -- it's our little detection device there -- can be easily fooled, and this is the problem. 
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. 
(Laughter) That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs. 
And after the close of the election, you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. 
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. 
It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale, okay, there you go. The scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet, threw up enough dust to block out the sun. 
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you and protect you from doubt or change. 
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area, and if you looked in the foreground on the big print, you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling. 
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical. 
So what are we looking for in a meal? 
And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle. 
But combined, they can create something like this. 
And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. 
You can run with our women's track team." 
One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know: when you fall asleep, it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. 
They had no safety, no real technology. 
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. 
What do you do? 
A shocker in American jurisprudence. 
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all. 
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members. 
So I don't want somebody who's saying, "Hey, I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. 
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. 
On top of that, those are the places from where trouble comes. 
Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come. 
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation. 
Just like Jordan and so many other makers, Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them. 
And it continues. 
(Applause) So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema. 
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data. 
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. 
Because clouds can mean anything you want. 
But I think we can do both at the same time here. 
Things in life start out being general cell, and they become specialized: You have tissue cells, you have muscle, brain cells. And same things happens with say, a hammer, which is general at first and becomes more specific. 
I don't know, what should I do?" 
Listen to other people, enlighten ourselves. 
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. 
It's almost, "Do your homework," -- some involvement. 
We get a lot of donated equipment. 
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown, cut off three inches from the bottom, go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design. 
Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero. 
And she came into town and she rushed around and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!" 
If you look at online media consumption -- in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet -- more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. 
And again, in action. 
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers. 
So it really suggests, when you're doing this -- based on this study and others we've done -- that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. 
(Laughter) He hung up on me! 
In my book I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising. 
And fifth, the element of uncertainty. 
(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain. 
Thank you. 
So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building. 
You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess. 
And we found that if your friend becomes obese, it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period. 
If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know, say, Century City, it would fit beautifully. 
That's what we're talking about. 
Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway. 
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well. 
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive, which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves, and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds, different disciplines, different ways of thinking and different experience, and find ways to engage with them. 
The great Descartes said something quite similar. 
(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. 
Maybe some of these conversations can continue. 
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on. 
Here at TED there are great opportunities. 
So that's how the idea came about. 
Sadly enough, the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research. 
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control. 
(Laughter) Now, the shortcut. 
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. 
Dick, he was my friend. I did call him Dick. 
So that is what you get when you face reality. 
This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing: "In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person." 
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive. 
Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most. 
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think, because all of those cities we're building are opportunities. 
You will get this model. 
Does she not learn from them? And so on. 
And if you plot them, you must choose some system. 
We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation, the way that you can model those gardens, the way they spiral around. 
When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. 
And those resources are going away. 
But not just that. 
And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed. 
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish. 
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark, and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it. 
Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps, but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can’t jump. 
I got a split reaction to that during the live performance, because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron, because usually there is someone making them afterwards. 
They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. 
And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals, progressing along, so when I turned 13 -- and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community, somebody had to kill the animals, there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat. 
And so this is very exciting news. 
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫ ♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫ BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ if you don't know by now, ♫ ♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫ ♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫ KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these. 
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone, the ability to create. 
When you become fluent with reading and writing, it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. 
It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy, and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles. 
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship? 
It was a hell of a challenge, and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. 
So you get the best of both worlds. 
If anything changes -- if the environment changes, the ground moves, or demand changes -- we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them. 
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored. 
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem. 
And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal. 
We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. 
Why is that? 
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it? 
I was, O.K.; that's fine. 
So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer. 
Actually, it's all just an idea. 
It's cumulative. 
And it's been an incredible experience. 
If I move in this particular way, I end up with a smaller variability across many movements. 
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth. 
Political parties: oh boy. 
That's called a profit. 
It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. 
Over the past three decades, we have lived through a quiet revolution. 
I was like, that sounds totally fake. 
Interestingly, this is a book that was published back in 1938. 
So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery. 
It's buying it. 
So how does it work? 
(Applause) I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. 
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world. 
This is fat digestion. 
This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects. 
Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health. 
He's getting no assistance from the government, and he's building a second, bigger boat. 
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children. 
So one thought is: after 9/11, when the airports closed, our flu season was delayed by two weeks. 
For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. 
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game. 
The last element is partnership. 
Both people won supporters, but on my count, the mood of the TED community shifted from about 75 to 25 to about 65 to 35 in favor, in favor. 
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. 
And then she was nervous. 
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. 
This is amazing, I think. 
People panic. 
I said, "I have no idea." 
In order to access these sub-surface environments that we're interested in, we're very interested in developing the tools to do this. 
So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo. 
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities. 
One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease, women do, on average, have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women. 
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. 
Disease. 
She's got big hair -- although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas. 
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision on top of the physical world. 
(Laughter) Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them. 
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects, while the poor die without ambulances and medicine. 
But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives. 
What can artwork say about this? 
He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil, to not denounce, and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance, and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room. 
And the challenge here is a building that will be green, that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel, is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point, is very, very much about the lifestyle. 
So if you want to understand the action of drugs, you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to, and also in the ways you don't want them to. 
It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer, and actually, she did something more amazing. 
And business creates them when it's able to meet a need at a profit. 
But most importantly, we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems and human scale self-assembly systems. 
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?" 
And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say, "I like sleeping. 
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police, like in this classic scene from "The Godfather." 
I'm an ignostic. 
And it's not just with transportation, my love, but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com. 
The small stuff counts. 
And when I finished it, I came back the next day. 
We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence, our interests and preferences, our relationships, our financial histories, and on and on it goes. 
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money. 
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. 
It's all right. 
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. 
How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception, rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality? 
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024. 
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play. 
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting. 
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. 
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb. 
First, we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body. Strange. 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. 
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated, you're definitely going to catch cancer and die. 
They went far beyond that 1900 banker. 
So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial. 
But some verbs are irregular. 
So here I was, December 7th, 2008. 
Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational. 
So, the tiger is the icon. 
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. 
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. 
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know, in the example of the nose to the face, there's a fractional part-to-whole idea. 
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs. 
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery. 
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. 
It's the spirit inside." 
So in some cases, we can abolish totally the need for manual labor. 
That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above. 
And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused. 
Because in the mid-1950s, when I was a tiny child, they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik, which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin. 
The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. 
I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular. 
They made it aspirational. 
Just to give you an example, every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters. 
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize, says that dyslexia helped him write sentences. 
(Applause) Well, this is about state budgets. 
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness? 
Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves, it'll tell us who we are. 
So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. 
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. 
More often than not, it's a power struggle in one country, or even a small region within one country. 
Why is 25 percent important? 
But we have something. 
How old are you? What do you do? 
For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. 
How many years of protection do I need? 
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans, and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales. 
In 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections, which ended the more autocratic secular regime, which was the beginning of Turkey. 
And I'd like to think if this was the case, they probably would have rehearsed it a few times. 
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. 
I'd gone through some changes. 
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event, which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights, the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls, which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible. 
So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them. 
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around. 
What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics, because many municipalities recorded the cause of death. 
It's a secret. 
And what did it start? 
And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting. 
I was running across the street, and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head. 
And so you can kind of hack a pencil, just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. 
And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right, that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens. 
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms. 
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one; anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way, to do it in a radically diffused fashion; and democracy is a set of technologies, which have the effect of, in principle, diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern, and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. 
So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. 
It's fallen by half. 
But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable. 
We have focused on the problems. 
(Applause) I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
The future of personal health that I'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model, not in a hospital or clinic. 
When it comes time to spawn, they come inside, and these two tuna that were tagged, you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. 
Because, despite their problems, I had spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. 
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about. 
But David has absolutely no expectation. 
And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick. 
That'll speed them up. Everything will work out better that way. 
But this is it. 
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back. 
There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington, right next to Lincoln and Jefferson. 
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. 
And while this machine in some sense is silly, in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose. 
These might be courier services or cable guys for instance, just to see whether the AED that's submitted still is in place. 
Now where is the car industry on that? 
So all of these scores are made up of weather data. 
I pulled them aside. 
And so this kid was probably abused, abandoned, ignored, betrayed by almost every adult along the way. 
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture. 
Everything is everything. 
They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in 1999. 
He is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate. 
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? 
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research -- 40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other, I would [unclear]. 
In fact, we redefine what poverty means. 
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did. 
The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together. 
From my American perspective, when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences, she has every right to have that request met. 
(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics, between Chile and Bolivia, the Andes completely change. 
When we watch a car chase in a movie, it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. 
But my colleagues didn't know. 
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. 
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either. 
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking, the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game. 
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. 
Perhaps that was the intention. 
There's 100 percent star anise in there. 
The name was John James, and in those days, if a family member committed a crime, the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. 
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built, and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways in the next 10 years. 
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut. 
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+. (Laughter) What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create. 
And what I wanted to know was, "OK, here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?" 
All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly. 
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water, and whatever active ingredient you want to put in, and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved, just immune boosters. 
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. 
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. 
People were out. 
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food. 
And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors, and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them. 
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses. 
I'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I've done in the last year. 
One study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement, whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent. 
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around -- they'll be there in a second -- right there, notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. 
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract, and a very short time for the limb to fly out. 
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953. 
Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. 
You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?" 
That myth is testable. 
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books -- about 300,000 now -- doing very well. 
In this video, again, my son is being traced out. 
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. 
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers." 
I can wear it around. 
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever. 
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. 
And as a kid I grew up very close to here, and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. 
The good thing is that we are not powerless. 
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. 
And that was in Hamburg. 
But you just have to go to a garden center, and they're in little paper packets. 
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select -- there used to be competition and parades and so on. 
Dr. James Levine at, in this case, the aptly-named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear, held their diet steady, and then started pumping the calories in. 
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high. 
The colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane. 
That's a lot of light. 
But here, unlike Andrea, here are supposed to be eaten. 
(Laughter) So, okay, I'm going to America. 
And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. 
I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening. 
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. 
The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip. 
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well. 
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. 
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less." 
In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum; life does it with a very, very common iron. 
This is not a fake. 
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat. 
But they are extremely efficient organizations. 
So just imagine: one day very soon, you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. 
But they're very keen that we don't let money drop into that relationship, else it turns into something like this. 
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick. 
Russia has actually stockpiled enough for 95 percent of all Russians. 
Now, coumarin is a very common thing, a material, in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America. 
We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth. 
And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over. 
He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help. 
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. 
It's crazy. 
Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet, but that's one idea to think about, urban islands. 
But if you give talks to kids, you know, one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think, "Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go, you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever. 
I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about." 
Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday, to try to attach this problem. 
So, I'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. 
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist -- and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective. 
Now, the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York, Chicago and Seattle. 
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London. 
And this is an important lesson, because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. 
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age. 
They're the largest private employer in America. 
We guessed that film, whose stories are a meeting place of drama, music, literature and human experience, would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB. 
They've pioneered a different approach to villages. 
They're all coming in at this time, walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in. 
These tuna swim the entire ocean. 
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere. 
Good news: Chariot's coming. 
(Laughter) That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums. 
on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years, from Spain to the borders of China. 
It is being funded very very -- in a big way. 
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount. 
If you think of everything in your life that you own, when you walk out that door, what do you consider to take with you? 
(Applause) What we're really here to talk about is the "how." 
And then we met and we talked, and I'm like, he doesn't look like somebody who was built out of nothing. 
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all? 
Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. 
And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp. 
(Applause) Idiots. A couple of years ago, Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess. 
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing. 
I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. 
There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. 
(Laughter) TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining, as I thought it would have been. 
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript. 
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one? 
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right. 
If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials and so forth, this is what you get. 
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one. 
So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.

This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago, where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created, kind of, a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area. 
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data." 
And that is because of the atmosphere. 
And technology democratized music by making everything available. 
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this, turning waste streams into schemes that create value. 
I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.

And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother. 
And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem. 
All Brazil was shocked. 
So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas. 
You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. 
Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit. 
The only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources, and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers, with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception, along with special cameras and high-speed film, right? 
Child: Yeah. 
I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning, and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them. 
They're not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did. 
Now, unless you're a prison guard, the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false. 
Here, let me give you an analogy. 
And I ask myself, "Why have things come to this?" 
And here's the result. 
So basically, please don't go and download any of the viruses that I show you. 
And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. 
(Laughter) No kidding. 
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer." 
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. 
I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe, and he agrees to sell me three clubs.

We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many. 
And that gets us down from the 1.5, where we've reached for education, down to 1.3. 
So you can read "architecture active" or "active architecture." 
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13," and when I worked on this film, I discovered something about how our brains work, and how our brains work is that, when we're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever, it changes and alters our perception of things. 
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google. 
So if we cut open Dracorex -- I cut open our Dracorex -- and look, it was spongy inside, really spongy inside. 
There was a media blackout in 2008, when there was post-election violence in Kenya. 
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. 
So there's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in Africa, and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so, they were not alone on the planet. 
Snakes are occasionally born with legs. 
And moderate on present-hedonism. 
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists, is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles. 
Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. 
The light those galaxies emit, even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light, will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us. 
I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?" 
She is 15 years old. 
I'm like, screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond. 
We are human, and we have the capacity to love, we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates, I think. 
I mean that simplicity sky. 
What can we learn from them? 
(Laughter) And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself." 
But there's no major difference. 
Now when these go out of whack, you have two options. 
We owe it to our children and grandchildren. 
However, huge supercomputer analyses, done of the likely effectiveness of this, show that it won't buy us much time at all. 
But such a teacher is seldom found. 
I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message. 
Well, you know the story. 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. 
But what would be so amazing about this? 
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. 
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO. 
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk, because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters. 
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education -- no, you can also provide that as well. 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" 
So here is normal speed. 
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be -- because of the Golden Rule. 
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources, this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself, and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release, and it turns out that is press release -- as in P.R. 
So, we came up with multiple hypotheses: there's little green people down there taking it; there's all sorts of things going on. 
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system, why don't we just do it? 
And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. 
And as I looked down on the ground, I noticed there was some ants running around. 
On the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s. 
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors, light from behind the projection, or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible. 
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument." 
If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way. 
To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white. 
Well, I think we've found its secret: It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule 30 or like this. 
The year is 1987. 
He's standing the watch in Helmand, in southern Afghanistan. 
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work, and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows, it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of. 
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn, and have been for the past two and a half years. 
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw, and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins. 
And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure, and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be. 
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine, where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer. 
That's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best. 
And it's what story cutting is all about. 
This is our time. This is intimate time. 
It's all about partnerships. 
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day, the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. 
We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. 
Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt? 
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. 
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about, because, if it's us that's messed up, it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it. 
And then through the various years we invented various vehicles. 
I don't know what part of the country you live in. 
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built, and so we followed. 
And so has my other incredible collaborator, Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford -- he made much larger hairs than the gecko, but used the same general principles. 
All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself. 
And the first song I wrote was in English, and the second one was in Chinese. 
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world. 
Jake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye." 
That's larger than the entire population of Russia. 
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all -- despite my own intensely religious background, I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity, and I knew nothing about Islam at all. 
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner. 
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. 
BF: Thank you guys! 
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth, then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth. 
There is so much mystery we don't know. 
So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. 
What about a great depression? 
She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality. 
The pleasure system, as you see, which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin, is widely spread throughout the brain. 
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example, publishing their plans online and saying to the world, "Please, could you help us to actually make them work this time?" 
That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole." 
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages. 
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. 
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad. 
And so it became a tutoring center -- publishing center, is what we called it -- and a writing center. 
And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively. 
And we've done, in the past four years, a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain, and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain. 
So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands. 
So military technologies can influence the course of the world, can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons. 
But if we plot them out according to their charges, some beautiful patterns emerge. 
We all saw how hard you were working." 
What if there were a pure form of justice? 
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots. 
And it's all part of the same design. 
We've managed to adapt, and have conquered the whole planet. 
Why should there be order in war? 
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude, the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable, that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&amp;D effort. 
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here. 
(Laughter) (Buzzing) (Click, click, bang) (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. 
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them. 
If we spend less on these children but on the right services, we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs. 
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. 
The biggest lesson I learned was many years later when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said I don't look like I have any experience to be working in this business. 
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. 
So, the way we study that is, let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. 
And from that you have new possibilities for computing. 
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones. 
Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts. 
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty. 
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied, because we now know, from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth, that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. 
So here's what I want you to do. 
How do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make, and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions? 
North Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa. 
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. 
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again." 
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. 
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said. 
They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop. 
I would wander the streets searching for food, and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips, and wanting to steal them from him. 
But really? Do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food? 
Why is this happening? 
Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work, but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. 
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here, put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer. 
Unspeakably dangerous. 
The first thing that you have on the tax is -- you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents. 
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation. 
The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. 
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough. 
There are all kinds of benefits to this. 
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K. 
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way, in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories. 
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. 
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room. 
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady. 
In other words, your perfect non-lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse. 
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. 
It's been 780,000 years since this happened. 
JA: Yep. 
The problem is enormous. 
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987. 
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba? Raise your hands. 
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside. 
Or to give you another example, what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves? 
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case, a surgeon in the other. 
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. 
His parents were of Russian descent. 
And in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says, maybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system. 
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second. 
So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations. 
I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life. 
This is the design of the bus, and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding. 
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed. 
Secondly, think about this. 
And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants. 
So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft. 
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. 
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet. 
It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. 
And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species, could there be even a smaller genome? 
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx. 
And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company, to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability, which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly -- not another fresh drop of oil -- and to do no harm to the biosphere. 
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. 
And I just wanted to personalize that. 
When I mention mushrooms to somebody, they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms, their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy. 
What's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags, and some airbags are quite advanced, they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to, if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition. 
I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back up on this stage, maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. 
And they saw strange pictures like this. 
♫ my song of love, my song of life, my song of love, ♫ ♫ my song of life, my song of love, my song of life. ♫ ♫ Ooh, I’ve not tried to run away from song, ♫ ♫ I hear a persistent voice, more powerful than the enemy bombs. ♫ ♫ The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood. ♫ ♫ My song of love and my song of life, my song of love, ♫ ♫ my song of life, my song of love, ♫ ♫ my song of life, my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- ♫ 
So you end up, number three, not swimming, in the case of freestyle, on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water. 
But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. 
I was past 40 when my father died. 
So the market is there. 
That's the natural cycle. 
So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him, it's that he shows he trusts the victim. 
I work with really amazing, little, itty-bitty creatures called cells. 
So we might have -- for the first time in our species -- feeling chases model, model chases reality, reality's moving -- they might never catch up. 
So actually, how can we do it? 
They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. 
Well let me give you an example. 
It's really horrible. 
There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor. 
And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ... 
I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the 20th century, the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers, I'd like to call them all up here, and they're going to call back to you. 
Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me. 
That's a perfectly rational thing. 
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. 
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. 
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" 
Governments snatch short-term opportunities and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost. 
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. 
So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. 
You see, we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions. 
So I will spend a little time at the end. 
(Laughter) I found out that's very true, working on this campaign worldwide. 
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now. 
(Applause) That's how we traveled in the year 1900. 
It's getting near zero. 
You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech, things that you can't get out of closed captioning. 
(Applause) Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that. 
And then the important third dimension. 
And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. 
It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. 
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. 
This is a 3D printer. 
So local food production is out. 
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people, and of that 311 million people, it turns out 144,000 are called Lester. 
It actually has a very thick atmosphere. 
We see these magnificent star nurseries, where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise. 
(Laughter) And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made, just to sort of understand what these things are. 
What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee? 
Now I can't speak for you, but it seems to be the case that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to. 
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again. 
Somi. 
This is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives. 
But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world, which is going to be the case with these technologies, when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial, which is already the case, and when they're almost impossible to police, it's not a question of if this is going to happen, it's when and where and how it's going to happen. 
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights, So I had to choose another career, and this was in fact relatively easy for me, because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood, which was international relations. 
I had to do something. 
ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. 
There's also a huge emotional impact. 
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries. 
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds. 
So, if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. 
That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking. 
(Laughter) Why? Why? Why do you want to do that? 
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset. 
SW: Good job! 
Particularly Mars, but also Europa, the small, icy moon around Jupiter. 
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. 
Do we have any evidence that that is happening? 
With the BRTs we're doing, again, the cheapest and fastest way, we're going to move to 63 percent of the population being carried by high-capacity transportation. 
And it received quite a bit of attention. 
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive. 
We are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority. 
Historically, for example, chopsticks -- according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan -- resulted in long-term changes in the dentition, in the teeth, of the Japanese public. 
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things; in particular, it lets you find hemozoin. 
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier? 
This is just the weight versus the age. 
That's triple bottom line! Okay? 
It's not a flood, it was pushed up there. 
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. 
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one. 
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, "Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage." 
He and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach right now taking classes. (Applause) And what does this example -- what's important to keep in mind for ourselves? 
And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. 
This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team. 
And thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. 
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice, the Igbos would destroy the god. 
She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted. 
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. 
(Laughter) Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that, I think it would be good next year. 
The bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are. 
(Laughter) OK? Here we go. 
With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. 
Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. 
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here. 
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. 
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. 
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. 
For example, for things that were written more than 50 years ago, the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words. 
How were we to do it? 
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. 
And after a few months, you touch Jesse on his chest, and he felt his missing hand. 
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful." 
You don't see it, make no reaction? 
And they were there for some time. And then they were gone. 
Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. 
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. 
Larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month. 
I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. 
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people, meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values. 
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school. 
They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain. 
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter) So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. 
Very different notion. 
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. 
I'm not saying they're broken. 
Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. 
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind. 
All right. 
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s and many bunkers from the World War II era. 
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. 
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary, because I want to talk to you later. 
It was such a smooth ride. 
Where are all the little ones?" 
He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion, and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream. 
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. 
Jews invented foie gras. 
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great. 
And that's not fair. 
BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll) BF: Oh, Daniel. 
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously? 
And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. 
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. 
And the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional. 
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters. 
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. 
NA: As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women. 
I didn't make up pre-vivor. 
And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s -- Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said, "Geo-engineering won't work." 
Sam, please have a seat. 
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well, because the same equipment -- phones, computers -- let you consume and produce. 
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. 
Against the background of rising inequality, marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives. 
It was the first cancer virus discovered, and when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene." 
Go to the website. Look at the audit results. 
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism." 
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with, and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world. 
Well obviously this is a replica. 
Thank you. 
Ready? 
Upgrades the life for these geese. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Laughter) OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. 
So what we're talking about is sperm competition. 
"Thirst." 
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. 
And he was great. He just gave her a big hug in return, and it worked out great. 
What is raveling? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. 
So they're reinventing it, using these tools. 
If you give something to a charity or to the public, you get a pat on the back and a tax donation -- except on the Net, where you can go broke. 
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. 
The Chinese don't feel like that. 
Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies, but this is what has happened. 
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it. 
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. 
So this isn't finished at all, but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. 
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream. 
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way. 
(Applause) Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens, as participants, as people with the right to write our own narratives. 
And they found things like, when you see crystal meth on the street, if you add police presence, you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen. 
He groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people. 
Goodbye, my love, goodbye." 
And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts. 
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. 
We mixed with these earlier forms of humans, wherever we met them, and we mixed with each other ever since. 
(Applause) Let's talk dirty. 
What electric fields are are a field of forces. 
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom, but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right? 
So thank you. 
I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this. 
Mother nature doesn't negotiate; she just sets rules and describes consequences. 
Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this. 
I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand, and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface, and that was milk. 
Evelyn Glennie: Well then, stop clapping. (Laughter) Try again. 
They don't experience this. 
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra. 
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images. 
How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. 
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems. 
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with, because they were all elaborately art-directed, and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer. 
All right, I gotta gel up. 
So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian, you would want to become a Chinese in order to live 10 years longer. 
It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else. 
$55,000, and that's an incredible deal. 
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000. 
And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment. 
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. 
It's now more than 82 percent. 
And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps. 
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow." 
But that doesn't mean that we can relax. 
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military." 
Could we have people singing together in real time? 
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. 
If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw," it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit, all the seesaws will disappear. 
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick -- this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low, to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high. 
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. 
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. 
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know. 
Many barriers are breaking down. 
The first frack job was in '47. 
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis. 
(Applause) So -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce. 
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study -- I know this will come as a shock to all of you -- the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. 
That's my son, Oliver. 
And he said one of them is called Maluma. 
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level. 
Thank you. 
So I asked the people what happened. 
And finally, we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools. 
So the question arises: when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are? 
We have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries, and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. 
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out, and we realized it was okay. 
Those sold for two dollars each. 
What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does? 
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. 
(Music) Speaker Coach 1: ♪ Let's prepare for main stage. ♪ ♪ It's your time to shine. ♪ ♪ If you want to succeed then ♪ ♪ you must be primed. ♪ Speaker Coach 2: ♪ Your slides are bad ♪ ♪ but your idea is good ♪ ♪ so you can bet before we're through, ♪ ♪ speaker, we'll make a TED Talk out of you. ♪ Speaker Coach 3: ♪ We know about climate change, ♪ ♪ but what can you say that's new? ♪ ♪ SC 1: Once you find your focus ♪ ♪ then the talk comes into view. ♪ 
As anyone would, as they do this, they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money. 
It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away, so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece. 
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in. 
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. 
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls. 
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar. 
(Laughter) Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge. 
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident." 
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house. 
And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade. 
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. 
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations, and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients. 
And as Dan Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. 
They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work, and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils. 
I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me, something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was. 
They're not. 
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look. 
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century. 
Many of them didn't want to bribe. 
There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but that electronic eyes can perceive. 
And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation. 
It took us half a century to adopt the telephone, the first virtual-reality technology. 
She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations. 
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent. 
And I absolutely love the periodic table. 
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example, calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy. 
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right? 
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region. 
What you see is an artist's conception of this facility, which is built in a mountain in Svalbard. 
When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. 
The problem is, in my village, Oakland, in most of our villages, we don't see that connection. 
Let me tell you something, people. 
But a better way is to, what I call proactionary principle, which is: You engage with technology. 
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along. 
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century. 
And I thank you for having me here tonight. 
That three-year-old boy is still part of you. 
And the Chinese said to me, "Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right. 
We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution, as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create. 
So back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy, perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia. 
Well, the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend. 
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True." 
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities." 
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale. 
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans, people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation, the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals, will they live longer? 
So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants," in approximately 60 seconds. 
Women typically listen expansively. 
It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash. 
This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids. 
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide, all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself -- CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently. 
You have no idea how much time I spend. 
And in Europe, there's certain parts of Europe, where we're seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects. 
And that's why I think this is important. 
What's in the box? 
Loving elephants as I do, that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life, and I will carry that to my grave. 
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal, if we study this mammal, we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses, such as blindness and deafness. 
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men. 
And next time it's going to be vibration." 
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them. 
First of all, there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques, not to mention really cheap miniature motors -- brushless motors, servo motors, stepper motors, that are used in printers and scanners and things like that. 
Hopefully everybody? More than 10? 
People who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the Internet all night long. 
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it. 
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters. 
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. 
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. 
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay? 
And they can't go even to university. 
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base. 
So I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures. 
Because we all knew that just six years earlier, half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived. 
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence. 
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. 
He's a terrible producer of videos, but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it. 
Right? It's pretty big. 
We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. 
Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill? 
And then sort of through a process of wandering around, I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars, in a way that is convenient and affordable, you could get to a solution. 
On the face of it, it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness, what's an unfair advantage. 
So if I squeeze the base, the bands go from base to tip. 
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992, the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars. 
We have a way of addressing that, a new way of addressing that. 
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only, without medication. 
But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was. 
Where are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt, which -- some people think Pluto's not a planet, that's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt. 
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs. 
And so this is very important. 
And you're waiting for your girl. 
Everything in its place. First stage. 
If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise, because there's unique fingerprint, we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. 
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing. 
And I'm trying to start it as a movement. 
What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. 
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and 16. 
They know what they're looking for. 
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one, I think we can get this and other goals done. 
So Luke, you go to your communications professors -- you're majoring in communications -- and you ask them for permission to come to TED, which might have a little bit to do with communications, and what was their reaction? 
It was clean, efficient, there was no high, there was really no danger, it had no street value. 
First of all, it's China's economic performance over the past 30 years. 
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. 
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience. 
And how do you secure their privacy? 
I could go on and on. 
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists. 
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient. 
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. 
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm, that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community. 
Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds. 
The skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. 
There are about 10,000 species of ants. 
The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me. 
The usual sort of thing. 
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. 
Two years ago, I was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program. 
Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear. 
We adapt. 
So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. 
(Laughter) In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. 
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. 
More on that later. 
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much. 
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?" 
So this is Doug Engelbart. 
So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat, in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. 
You create peer-to-peer learning, or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills. 
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. 
So we don't know how we got here. 
I'm an extreme example of this. 
That's a lot more than conventional science has done. 
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire, and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. 
But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down, that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. 
You can do and use the skills that you have. 
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria. 
This is an example of what an organized society can do, a society that acts. 
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. 
It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. 
Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said, "When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. 
The dolphin's at the keyboard. 
And if you comply, you will go to heaven. 
Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. 
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this? 
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea, right? 
I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic. 
Fascinating work they're doing. 
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free. 
This whole notion that music is a language -- well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all, and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. 
We got it just done in time to show you, so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center. 
And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale, and is also a useful learning strategy for the students, because they actually learn from the experience. 
First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. 
I said, "Move your normal hand." 
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar, at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor. 
And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do. 
That is Coltan extraction, gold mining. 
So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, "Could I do with a little life editing? 
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. 
That turns out to be important. 
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. 
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. 
And I came up with these. 
Now crabs don't miss footholds, because they normally move on sand -- until they come to our lab. 
But then I said, I want to go out with this information. 
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda. 
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing, that they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear. 
Same with automobiles. 
And basically, since we released it about three or four years ago, a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books. 
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world, they always form vivid images of the preceding world." 
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started. 
This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett, who talked about taking the intentional stance. 
But this here, this is not the street. 
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you. 
So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment. 
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. 
(Laughter) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. 
For some reason it explodes, and you begin to get these things. 
This is a public budget. (Laughter) And as you can see, it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources. 
We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism. 
And the water will go where it should go. 
Like, I remember one day I found my dad convulsing, foaming at the mouth, OD-ing on the bathroom floor. 
So, Siberia, Manchuria. 
We need to drive a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies, where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband, full medical characterization, and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund, to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. 
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is. 
They may not have their dad. 
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns, regardless of what other people want or recommend. 
Basically, no one's very happy. 
I do. I look for it all the time. 
Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. 
A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play. 
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless. 
(Music) (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Uh oh. 
(Laughter) Now, David and Hidehiko and Ketaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans, and there are many similarities, and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies, the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example -- (Laughter) but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences, and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing. 
You look at some other scientific revolutions, and this case, I'm talking about the solar system, that's Copernicus, Darwin's evolution, and tectonic plates, that's Wegener. 
Thanks very much. There's always lots more. 
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay. 
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area. 
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption, that we think that, if people need something, we don't have to make them want that. 
(Whistle) That's the rope whistle. 
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it. 
Kismet: (Nonsense) Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. 
But this is also what I saw. 
I'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is -- The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. 
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way, to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. 
(Laughter) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame. 
Stories gave me a sense of center, continuity and coherence, the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. 
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line. 
My story is the power of choice. 
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent, for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. 
The reality of polio today is something very different. 
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head? 
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people." 
So, certainly the challenge was there. 
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. 
I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day. 
"Ah!" say creationists. 
Something is said in the gaps between all the information that's collected. 
If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there. 
It was a lot of hard work. 
This is a time of need. 
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David: "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?" 
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder, and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane. 
This is Uce. 
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room. 
("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making") ("What a friend we have in cheeses") ("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something? 
And that's really where we started, the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park, and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape. 
That's not only to censor you. 
During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media, now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster. 
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter) I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes. 
Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight, before you slouched into that grassy hush. 
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. 
Now look at those numbers. 
We thought it might be there, and we went and found it. 
And that can happen with awareness -- awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood. 
Yeah. 
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week. 
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one. 
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. 
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. 
Thank you very much. 
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education. 
We've all made a mistake, myself included, by focusing down, by being a reductionist. 
I'm not a big natural gas producer. 
And the cables go really continent to continent. 
And along the way, I'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques. 
That's great. 
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way. 
And we have to connect both levels, so if you're up there, you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. 
I knew if I didn't return to my body, I'd have to leave this world forever. 
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task, when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. 
(Laughter) The only other thing is, it was a real shock. 
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world. 
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. 
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel. 
Because this is what we want. This is what we want. 
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing. 
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. 
And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. 
So, here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. 
And these are artificially created whistles. 
This is a huge collaboration. 
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall. 
And this example is the latter. 
Because America is an incredibly rich country. 
One is what's on the Boston Public Library. 
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. 
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video? 
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. 
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. 
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. 
That's where Maureen went to school. 
Now, if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer, you would never notice. 
So, this object has six symmetries. 
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world's countries today are democratic, 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. 
And we went around and we talked to people, and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know? 
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. 
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline. 
(Applause) You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact. 
Did you notice this section is foreplay? 
"I already have," she replied. 
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. 
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended." 
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?" 
And there is, I think, in that, a very important lesson for all of us. 
This is a very, very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system. 
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony." 
This is the uncle signing the adoption papers. 
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. 
And this is less futuristic than it may sound. 
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view. 
And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest. 
Nearby there's a French bunker, and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met. 
But again, that only shows part of the picture. 
We should treat it carefully and with respect, and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness, without some real good justification. 
And I'm just saying, "No way." 
That is the system that seems to work." 
And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. 
Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't. 
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?" 
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life. 
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. 
And when he dared to speak, he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined. 
(Laughter) ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. 
It will know us, and that's good. 
For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors, and for another, they don't make devices quite this small, especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network. 
"Like we're a bunch of elitist, morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers." 
You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. 
Right? This is simple physics. 
I mean this quite seriously. 
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here. 
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. 
That should be the goal. 
And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby. 
People reuse it for a slab for their home. 
Havana is a wonderful area. 
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. 
Thank you. 
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale. 
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly. 
And he went because he hoped the world would listen. 
(Laughter) Another person. 
Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking, by the movement of narcotics, opium, here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States. 
Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries. 
They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty. 
Now, planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story. 
I want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this. 
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture. 
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. 
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. 
As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again. 
They are paralyzed. 
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "I think therefore I am," this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" -- "I err therefore I am." 
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've created, some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here, running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. 
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about. 
Why don't we train our children in compassion? 
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs. 
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right? 
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate. 
(Applause) Everybody talks about happiness these days. 
They won't necessarily be easy lives, but in the end, it is all that will sustain us. 
I'm absolutely not anti-renewables. I love renewables. 
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. 
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?" 
Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent. 
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering. 
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. 
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. 
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. 
But there was one programmer who decided that this wasn't the way to work. 
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes. 
This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. 
It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States. 
Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person, doing things all over the place. 
(Laughter) But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. 
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. 
And so the theorist guys say, well, I think this is what's going on, and the experimentalist says, no, you're wrong. 
Possibly, but I remember my childhood. 
Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile. 
How come, then, it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery? 
It's exactly the same in this context. 
Her future husband, Jeff, was working for Canon cameras, and met Natasha at the Olympic Village. 
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge. 
You're just kind of moving around. 
But there is a better translation. 
They can go into your skin and create skin infections. 
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line? 
What I particularly like about this picture, too, is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. 
And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes-sensational documentary. 
Its temperature drops. 
He expects that within the next 50 years, the 100,000 people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia. 
And if you look at the 36 countries with the highest burden of malnutrition, that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy every year. 
I'm just doing what I can here. 
The finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world. 
(Applause) You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well. 
It's the same with institutions. 
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. 
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before." 
Because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell, then cells start hanging out together in societies. 
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. 
I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her. 
(Laughter) The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break. 
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ... 
And we started asking them all questions. 
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. 
Because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you, how it keeps us from attempting great things, and life gets dull, amazing things stop happening. 
These things are faint. 
So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial. 
And we had a memorial service there a few days later. 
You're the adult. 
Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing, where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot. 
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power, and it confers on us a responsibility. 
There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play. 
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister, and something that we hadn't really thought of before. 
But this is very shaky. 
(Laughter) Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors. 
But the thing is to do a lot more of that. 
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. 
"Can you even see?" 
After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. 
But what's it's doing is sharing data. 
Now, I was thrilled about this, because at school, there was a bully named Kevin, and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class. 
It analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from. 
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. 
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere -- where you're doing something to the muffin -- you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse." 
"Ma, are you still doing that?" 
They can start to look at common pathways -- other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. 
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. 
You charge another inmate to clean his cell. 
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?" 
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure. 
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. 
Very, very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience. 
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker, and I'm most grateful to them for this. 
The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible, the literally false sentences. 
Why do we care about that? 
They're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better. 
If you receive something interesting, well that's what SETI does actually, what SETI has been doing for many years. 
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known -- friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. 
And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months. 
This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. 
There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that. 
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. 
Now, for those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task. 
(Applause) I work with a species called "Bonobo." 
Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles, which was distant for the humpback. 
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line, but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. 
The larvae have to develop very quickly. 
And when the vaccine appeared last winter, there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change, how their model changes, sort of wildly with no new information, with no new input. 
There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website. 
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. 
I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play, and where your body and your brain can work together. 
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. 
And this is one of our filmmakers' products. 
So the green shoots are out there. 
Everything else is mandated. 
The proscenium can fly. 
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building, he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did. 
This is an encore he used to do. 
And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. 
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie -- and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org, which is something new. 
The uterus would fall out, literally fall out of the body. 
There's two million emails per second. 
OS: Thank you. Thank you. 
I think the danger we have in today's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology. 
Now you can learn three interesting things from this. 
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. 
As we design these things, we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds, and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems. 
So the challenge then is, throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab, and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze. 
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before: FIFA, vuvuzela, weird jokes about octopi. 
And I was like, "Sure." 
And as the father was administering these instructions, a car drove by, slowly, and just after it passed the father and the teenagers, a hand went out from the front passenger window, and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father. 
They're now called KickStart. 
And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK -- and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure. 
Now it encourages it. 
One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how, if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer, how do we make things in a very general sense, and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware? 
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. 
We all go back so far, and in this present moment, on this day, all the people you meet, all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink. 
They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. 
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat. 
That's enough to stick six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall, no nails. 
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute. 
Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. 
A priest? 
Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about. 
(Laughter) This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean, when somebody else is picking up the tab. 
We've started in Chicago an organization -- a non-profit organization -- called Project Exploration. 
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey, discovering my own capabilities, maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey, figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world, and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in. 
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. 
You should try it yourself. 
And so, here I am -- never lost. 
And we don't. 
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy? 
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest, the one that's just motherhood and apple pie -- governments, mutual systems of support for governments -- and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance, and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. 
And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. 
Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this. 
I'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials. 
Okay, so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing, because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool. 
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. 
It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land. 
And what might happen at your lunch? 
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine. 
Because we've all had them, haven't we? 
Decrescendo. 
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it. 
Conscious listening always creates understanding. 
And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease for 50 years. 
Then one day, a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms. 
And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions. 
And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. 
Let's zoom in on one synapse, and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. 
We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. 
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail, and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas -- the experience capital of the world. 
The challenge: to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference. 
Among other things, because startup companies are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm and they're about 17.8 percent of output. 
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption, design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation -- the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful, productive and profitable. 
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself -- I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen. 
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure. 
And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to. 
This isn't Photoshopped. 
My measurements. 
And they left. 
And this is a systematic error people make. 
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. 
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars. 
Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. 
A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes. 
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry. 
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn, because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in. 
And now, boom, the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent. 
This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. 
Many different parts. 
Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. 
So I like to invent things too, and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back. 
Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves? 
And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. 
My favorite, though, are all the warning labels. 
We synchronize the machines, set them into these staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains. So for the first time, we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals, or have individuals playing computers, or try to make inferences that way. We can study individual dyads. 
So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago, we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. 
There I learned different things. 
And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. 
They just brought us there to hustle this group, you know, to create a project. 
But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are. 
So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again. 
Stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years, this order against the entropy of the world. 
One country, two systems. 
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss. 
Well, you take the first number, and you divide by the other three, and you get eight kilometers. 
Just everything is lined, it incorporates -- every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin. 
(Laughter) But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world? 
They're all over the world. 
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned, but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar. 
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was: Did she marry? 
So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words, you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk. 
Let it recover, before we start logging again. 
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity. 
Thank you. 
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is, at the very least, what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place. 
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that. 
And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program." 
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level. 
To which I have to say, here's the thing with the singing cats. That always happens. 
It's something you should think about doing. 
Am I out of time? OK. 
We need new deep-diving submarines. 
You needed to know that. 
And here's this incredibly simple molecule, a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together, and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure, for neurotransmission, for many, many things, but particularly cardiovascular health. 
You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat. 
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!" 
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz, it's two. 
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this -- is to say, "That's just stupid." 
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. 
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. 
In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. 
Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent -- in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent -- and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world. 
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in. 
I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege, and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything, not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being. 
The flow isn't natural. 
The Internet has played a great role, helping these people to speak up their minds, to collaborate together, to start thinking together. 
Thank you. 
And we're not exactly sure why that happens. 
But then, first you take a screen shot, and then you draw something that is related to it. 
But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. 
It knows when to stop growing because it can count. 
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. 
The worms are growing inches per week! 
the average answer, or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent. 
And if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery, their answer would hearken back to President Kennedy's remarks at Rice University in 1962 when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here -- "We choose to work on grid-level storage, not because it is easy, but because it is hard." 
Can you imagine? It's very symbolic. 
But it has an unexpected twist. 
And over the next five hours, she took care of it. 
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. 
Compassion has many faces. 
He was trembling when our boat approached, frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. 
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do -- even the good, well-intentioned companies. 
So micropayments have become huge. 
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up, and this is just a brief reference. 
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge. 
Completely unprecedented, historically. 
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? 
Boat got a bit dinged up, so did I. 
What's unusual about that? 
So I ran a little scan. 
It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains, but we certainly can begin to approach the question, and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. 
Age not at all as pathology; age as potential. 
One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether, when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs, we ought to be equipping them differently, and in particular, whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have. 
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves. 
It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption. 
The Egyptian people, and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition, have very high expectations of the government. 
And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community. 
I was at a crossroads. 
Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic in this country. 
That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience. 
At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things. 
I mean, on the slide, you can see that on our sensitive side, these cells that are responding to the drug, when we start blocking the protein, the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- they're going down. 
And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off. 
And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. 
Let's say -- I don't know -- what's the GDP of Spain? 
That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old -- 1965. 
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen, and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide -- enough, for instance, to come out of solution. 
And because of that, Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world, a place where no journalist had ever been permitted. 
But it's very simple. It's very simplistic. 
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ... 
This one we actually first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days, as we used to say -- when we were doing these kind of dives with air. 
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted. 
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech. 
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. 
Without it, a script is just words. 
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it, and set up the basic rules, go very much in the right direction. 
Should they be looking at other sectors? 
Global warming is already affecting people. 
I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. 
Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have, we can, just in a few seconds, get 24,000 images out of a body, and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data, or 800 phone books, and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books. 
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you. 
And, you know, just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here, and if you had to meet Bush, it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. 
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. 
You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back-up. 
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it! 
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. 
I have a piece, and I'm excited that I'm sharing it for the first time with you here. 
We all have to be included. 
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. 
Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change: the industrial Internet. 
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. 
I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. 
They were happy. They had their plans. 
Many of you will be thinking, but surely we can still stop this. 
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet. 
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting? 
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. 
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins. 
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. 
And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. 
Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps? 
I get the meat sweats. 
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done? 
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. 
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay, we are going to stand up again on our feet, but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic. 
And that's my specialty, right? 
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish, he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one. 
The memory is this bit over here. 
Government institutions were completely decapitated, including the presidential palace. 
(Laughter) And then finally, I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam, which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year. 
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule, that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever, since the beginning of us, of us as creatures. 
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. 
(Applause) When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. 
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here, you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. 
The skin had to be absolutely accurate. 
And the reason for this is because -- well, there are two reasons, I think. 
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today, after a few centuries. 
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer. 
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. 
You can go to Holy Name, which is coed, or St. John's, which is all boys. 
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was. 
(Laughter) How did this happen? When did this happen? 
Who else can have these qualities more than children? 
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design, and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. 
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs. 
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives. 
It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there, whether there are any real, true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made. 
So we started exploring this material called ETFE. 
10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979. 
It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers, covering what is now Pakistan, Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran. 
He says it's good. It's good to go outside. 
And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?" 
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that way now, and I agree with that. 
We make things glow. 
In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. 
Even so, up until very recently, nobody worried about GPS spoofers. 
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today. 
Yeah, what if we get it wrong? 
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. 
And then look at the Indian classical dancer, the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer, curvaceous. 
I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. 
I ran away. 
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one, then you underplanted with the sugar palms, and you plant this thorny fence. 
You couldn't transfer those to the model itself. 
(Laughter) And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?" 
The trees are the hair of our planet. 
So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return, the good that can be driven could be astonishing. 
(Applause) I have Excel. 
I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer. 
And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that, at least for the monkeys and us, works like a real financial currency. 
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. 
The Prakash, the overall effort has three components: outreach, to identify children in need of care; medical treatment; and in subsequent study. 
But we have trouble accessing our outcomes. 
It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector. 
I think we all kind of stand and watch. 
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network, a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit. 
What was this place called Minto? 
(Laughter) So I left them with it. 
What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said, the inventor and entrepreneur. 
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity, but over time, they gravitate there. 
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on." 
I'm responsible. 
And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. 
(Applause) Oh, thank you. 
But then in the last two years, it goes up again to 39 percent, indicating a rising living cost. 
That's what I'd like to share with you. 
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds. 
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers. 
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world, and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change. 
Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common, and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people. 
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ... 
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life, but actually counts what we most value, the things that are intangible. 
Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s. 
And I think the implications here are profound, whether it's for science, for commerce, for government, or perhaps most of all, for us as individuals. 
And we've got such a long way to go with this. 
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods like chili, or bouillabaisse. 
(Laughter) But he still knows a good thing when he sees it, and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. 
We had AirDynamisis, who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big, many year project, and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew. 
(Applause) And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons. 
I look forward to talking with all of you. 
And "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love. 
For example, in 1960 they were both very likely to have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week. 
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year. 
Now I liked it better when viruses were free. 
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling. 
Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution, and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. 
At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. 
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade. 
And I think the technology's on our side. 
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said, "If you want to do this, call me." 
In this case, the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space, and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. 
If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. 
You can see the individual structures of the woman. 
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897. 
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. 
We're going to connect our command center, via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center. 
But there was no evidence. 
So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves, but we all know what it's like to be afraid. 
One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel -- oil, coal or gas. 
And I talk to him. 
TH: These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. 
This is my big wish. 
Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at 16, against 58 percent of the wider population. 
But it's going to have a big impact because we're going to have niche drugs. 
The bigger you are, life gets faster. 
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow, and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down, we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. 
And suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible. 
And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot. 
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices. 
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer, Roy Chapman Andrews. 
I'm a business school professor, but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits. 
(Laughter) But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed, the point in my life when the two passions merged, the journey of learning that took place from that point. 
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil, because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years, when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. 
What was interesting was that, before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador, I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me, and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. 
It gets up to about 150 feet long. 
He said there's just not in demand. 
It was the liberalization of international financial markets. 
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love. 
So the next time you get dengue fever, if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible, you're likely to get worse symptoms, and you're more likely to get the more severe forms, hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. 
"Know thyself." 
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963, after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening. 
She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard. 
And that creates additional costs. 
Now we're going even further into science fiction. 
A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory, busy pumping hot air into the bubble. 
And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car? 
Alicia, in her own right, very famous. 
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible. 
It's a branching off from the human form. 
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos? 
I have a very relativistic view of security. 
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize. 
So they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. 
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. 
And this is, of course, not the first time you've probably recognized this. 
When you talk to workers, that's what they want. 
And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change. 
It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. 
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. 
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. 
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers. 
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists, we had opera singers, we had guitar players, and we had rap singers. 
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow -- and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door. 
They would be co-branded as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country. 
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11, San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels. 
Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
So we are bridging the digital divide. 
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference. 
Chairs: recycled and recyclable. 
And I will tell you a very funny story. 
We know chimps are faster and stronger. 
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief. 
And what's really, really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself. 
Now how do we do it? 
So, what happened is, a graduate student in China, Lulu Qian, did a great job. 
Take any cognitive domain you want, memory, motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law, getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on, put people into functional MRI devices, and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity. 
Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. 
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one. 
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant, by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people. 
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office, have more power to do good than at any time in history, because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. 
Unfortunately, treated again with surgery and chemotherapy. 
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease, suffering was alleviated. 
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. 
As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash. 
And the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something. 
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. 
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor, a lot more of it's being used. 
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways. 
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point. 
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning. 
The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. 
And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas, and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea. 
And you'd have some idea of what to do. 
For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials. 
Now you've all heard of at least insulin. 
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number, I want you just for a second to think of a million people. 
They are posh, they're wealthy, they're less likely to have outdoor jobs, they're less likely to do manual labor, they have better social support, they're less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating, interlocking social, political and cultural reasons, they are less likely to have skin wrinkles. 
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. 
No Shakespeare. 
And with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns. 
Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? 
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level. 
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies." 
The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail, is that evil lives on. 
So that's the kind of thing that, here, check this out, here's another way, and I won't overdo this. 
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail. 
Disclosure is so central to prevention. 
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave. 
South Africans just make music really freely. 
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. 
And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. 
The building was a true bird-killer. 
He didn't recognize that at the time, and he contracted leukemia, and he died at the age of 45. 
And our revenues are going to go this, that and the other thing. 
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. 
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed, and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior. 
Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home, and some of us don't. 
And in a sense, you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge, building a bridge from two sides of the river. 
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts. 
And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness, can hide secrets for a very long time. 
My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way, and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets, on accessorizing -- What can I add to my house, what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable? -- has kind of dominated the discussion. 
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field, like a screen. 
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. 
National message. Targeted individuals. 
And in the U.K., neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. 
OECD countries, by and large, you should think about these as the richest, most industrialized countries in the world. 
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew. 
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual. 
And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. 
That's good. 
So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English. 
That's our definition of a parallel line. 
What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there's some trace elements of the other ones. 
There is what Oprah tells us. 
And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that, when you have small problems on the individual level, like the price of gasoline to drive every morning. 
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically, because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal. 
There's evidence all around us: 40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care. 
That is what's happening right now, and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. 
And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. 
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada, from Corsica to Spain. 
And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. 
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice." 
Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize. 
People would come in and say, "What the --? 
Feynman said, "Forget all of that. 
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers. 
Bad blocks. But anyways, the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically. 
Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation, less rigorous ethical reviews, and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure. 
And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home. 
This is Makerbot. 
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. 
They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. 
They stood for weeks -- first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women -- wearing white, singing, dancing, saying they were out for peace. 
All the stories that we're telling -- well, of course, TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes. 
For example, they babysit each other's calves. 
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without them they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, act socially. 
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. 
On the contrary, doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high. 
This was the pre-bureaucratic age, an age in which everything had to be local. 
Well, the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. 
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties -- there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions, but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions, curled up so small, even though they're all around us, that we don't see them. 
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. 
Can we have the next video, quickly? 
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers. 
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today, working across photography, video and installation. 
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward. 
People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened People thought about, "Oh, my God. 
And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge, they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. 
(Music) That's them rolling. 
JH: Thank you. 
How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write? 
Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making -- it's the last to mature in late adulthood. 
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. 
And for a long time, people did not even want to touch it, because they'd say, "How can you have this reference point, this stability, that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day?" 
It requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats. 
AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger. 
You'll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes. 
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers. 
30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time, "Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?" 
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of. 
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. 
But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing." 
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl, that number seems awfully low. 
We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills, or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean, or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi-player video game engines to control many of these machines, to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries. 
How do we steer a balloon? 
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria -- life expectancy is 47. 
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. 
And the scene repeats itself so often. 
This is unprecedented, and it's big. 
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground. 
Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug -- a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. 
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. 
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman. 
(Applause) The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. 
This is a kind of agenda, which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma, because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. 
(Applause) All buildings today have something in common. 
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. 
And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way. 
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups. 
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones. 
Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men." 
(Applause) Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. 
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die, they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. 
But after three trips to Antarctica, I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. 
He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa, one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. 
It's all a little bit frightening, and emotional. 
And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end. 
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true. 
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?" 
And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ... 
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. 
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants. 
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. 
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. 
In Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis, the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years, and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools. 
We got invited to do the whole thing in New York, and in London, and in Los Angeles. 
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes, which is what you think it is, except not quite, because it's actually donated. 
He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, "Register for one credit. 
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. 
(Laughter) And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free. 
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. 
And they really help molecules, like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA, stay inside, develop, change, divide and do some of the processes that we call life. 
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. 
And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here, and I'm sure all of you found it, too. 
All start overage and under-credit. 
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks." 
Probably the worst advice I ever got. 
And I also want to share this one. 
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. 
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash? 
So, you're in a big corporation. 
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. 
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be, if you really want to know about the future, don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist. 
That little guy is frisky! (Laughter) Now, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating, and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks. 
And great art would have "head": it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts. 
What's happening in Costa Rica? 
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution. 
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in. 
We asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on. 
If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. 
Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ... 
That's what speech is like. 
And I said, "If Dylan were here now, do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?" 
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway. 
I'm going to cut some veins, arteries. 
I ask people sometimes, and they say, "I like the aquatic theory! 
It fits exactly where we need to fit it, right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system -- very critical. In fact that engine -- for those who are into the automobile -- know that it recently is applied to the RX8 -- the Mazda. 
I flew around the world. 
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four. 
You see on the left, when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars, they disagree about half the time, and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often. 
What they care about is the robot. 
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes! 
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. 
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up. 
And I'm very excited about this, because one thing we're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops. 
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. 
And there's another difference too, which is the object on the left is made from one substance. 
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet, but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there, or something like that, and software got in there that causes the centrifuges, in that case, to actually destroy themselves. 
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable. 
They're finding that their world is really collapsing. 
Once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. 
And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths. 
They found a treasure trove of documents: 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters. 
And of El Peje. 
And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks, and you want to assess, you know, how much jeopardy am I really in here, there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- Diver 1 (Video): What kind of sharks? 
They bring out the issues of stigma. 
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof, deliver about 20 watts per square meter in England. 
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us. 
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election. 
So in the technological world, we don't have experience to judge models. 
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation, but it was nearly negligible. 
Languages. Material versus method. 
And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk. 
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote: Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican, but I don't buy it. 
I love stories. I want to read." 
But to really see the details of the bee, and really appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer. 
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain. 
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s, which I'm sure my mom didn't know. 
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps. 
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto, from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC. 
It's now two years that you've been running? 
We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives, and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. 
He does not seem to be breathing. 
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting. 
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase, and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here. 
And there RISD appeared. 
It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. 
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. 
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment. 
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. 
And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer." 
Well, the murmuration functions to record a number of principles, and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. 
What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage? 
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg -- you know, isn't that nice? 
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site, Kenyan Pundit. 
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so-called primitives of the world. 
In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world." 
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Siftables. 
It's never been shown. 
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier? 
And in the worship of my church, the most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty." 
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong. 
So you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections -- you can see they're both increasing. 
I never would have even thought to think of this, but Match.com, the Internet-dating site, came to me three years ago and asked me that question. 
The greenest class in New York City. 
And people disagree about what the effect will be, but that seems to be the question, that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson, and if it does, what will become of these children later? 
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more. 
We were in Queens, we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown, so we were in the small, small, small boondocks. 
And we all have capacity to play signal. 
And worse than that, far worse than that, my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating. 
And one of the things that we need to do is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient, but we also need to fix the economy in general. 
And we think that these affect the way language is learned. 
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay. 
And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right? 
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week. 
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. 
So that peak expiratory flow rate, I've entered it up into the interactive software model. 
(Laughter) OK. 
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face? 
(Laughter) All right. I think I’m going to take these off now, because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK. 
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet, they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes, they'll be able to come into a microfocus. 
It's an important strategic partner. 
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. 
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about 2,300 words. 
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so. 
When the water goes down, they know what to do. 
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things -- I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. 
Now we have really made use of this, and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. 
Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah." 
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me. 
So we need to think about it here. 
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case. 
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton, and I could never do it." 
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off. 
It's actually strength -- it's power. 
What costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome. 
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again: namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. 
It's way too big a towel. 
And this is the tower from below. 
They've run out of good sites. 
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand, but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway, where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses, people are consuming to get to know the Joneses. 
Also, we do it in order to share with other people. 
You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff that might be used against you." 
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. 
They can be rented for pennies. 
And at some point he's dancing with his -- and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. 
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters. 
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think. 
I've known you, and I know, Lewis, deep down, right deep down here, that you are going to make this swim. 
And then they create, in real time, a facial composite of these two friends. 
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. 
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something, or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas. 
or who's being beaten up, for the first time, and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways. 
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. 
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden, is a mystery to me. 
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. 
It's called The Cloud. 
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple, then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat. 
He went on and on and calculated 67 powers of two. 
But the choice was theirs, and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide. 
How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting. 
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. 
You can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up. 
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal. 
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it. 
He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. 
Another thing all these molecules are telling us that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history, which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival. 
And so it's giving people more choices, but it's not taking away choices. 
So my argument today is basically this. 
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. 
RB: She was, you know, she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age. 
And then I left. 
Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room, and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter) If you can hear me, you can understand me without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me, that does not work. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. 
I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then. 
And they say, "No, no, that's what it says here in our holy book." 
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. 
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules. 
And sometimes asking the real celebrity, mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person, which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter). 
That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. 
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there. 
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. 
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget. 
a button, two guitar picks and lots of hot glue. 
That is, we have to seriously play God, not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right. 
And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds. 
We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function." 
And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence. 
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference, we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention. 
On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans, swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think that Islam is the enemy somehow -- that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. 
Now, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems, as you know. 
It transcends nation, the gender, the age. 
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia. 
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet. 
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us. 
We also try to study our foe. 
(Laughter) I don't want my Marines handing out aid. 
My state of Alabama, like a number of states, actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction. 
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair. 
And first of all, what do we even study? 
As if what we are doing one day will save lives. 
LG: The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission. 
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. 
Do they make sense? 
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. 
She died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends. 
If we count the number of chemicals in that system, actually, including the water that's in the dish, we have five chemicals that can do this. 
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. 
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians, mainly women and children. They are collateral damage. 
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life, but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side. 
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds. 
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles, you can't tell the difference, just by looking, between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles. 
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie. 
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. 
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all. 
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it? 
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. 
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet. 
Thank you very much. 
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth. 
Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. 
I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. 
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman? 
(Laughter) And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown, which I'll say more about in a minute. 
And sometimes A really is connected to B, and that's called association learning. 
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal. 
Hey. 
I wasn't very good at reading things. 
You know, she eats small portions. 
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again." 
(Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic. 
In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. 
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form, science has advanced. 
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds, not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing, Derek, you can hear every note, and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice, reproduce those on the keyboard, that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability. 
What has your investigation focused on? 
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this. 
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't, these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find? 
Your own personal play history is unique, and often is not something we think about particularly. 
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. 
["Blue"] DB: Yellow. 
This is on the way home. 
This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees. 
I didn't know it. 
Who thinks that B is true -- that on average, they're the same? 
This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th, thinking about itself in a very wonderful way. 
That red line is from the theory. 
And you crank it several times. 
But everyone is responsible. 
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. 
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer. 
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
But these conferences are going on, and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept, but actually, the bits that are, are making a difference, and what the politicians need is more permission from the public. 
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens -- as they were then called, finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling. 
Our entire health reform discussion right now, health I.T., when we talk with policy makers, equals "How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe?" 
(Laughter) But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. 
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. 
How do you think of where cosmology is now, in a sort of historical side? 
And finally, human resources: Conventional wisdom says hire battery experts, seasoned professionals, who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge. 
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking. 
There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information, and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. 
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest, because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them, and they sit there and they say, "Aw, shucks, it was an accident." 
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. 
(Laughter) This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. 
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started? 
And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice, called "Against the Fall of Night" and "The City and the Stars." 
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -- she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. 
Place cells are also being recorded in humans. 
They can't be 10 miles behind. 
This is very, very low. 
I said, "It's really, really easy." 
Our parents think we're cuckoo. 
In China, the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters. 
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point, the pre-industrial point, where we're very safely in the safe operating space. 
It's a noisy material, and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. 
Still, we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air, off the ground, like it was supposed to be. 
(Laughter) "Come to visit the children? 
This is what dictionaries used to look like. 
So this is some work that we're doing. 
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome. 
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley. 
So I started reading books in pairs. 
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble. 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Yes, right. 
It's like you dipped a marble in water. 
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. 
We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience. 
(Laughter) Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you -- (Laughter) Should I just turn that off? 
And I love the idea of something hidden. 
We have charted our love for our child over time. 
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. 
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room, pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight; and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke; and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters -- just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire, but these were icy, blue embers. 
(Laughter) You can go with the "Sticks One" music. 
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 
I know that beat. 
And I just thought it'd be wonderful, it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. 
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay? 
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about. 
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences. 
(Laughter) Now, superfly, the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower, and you smear them across flytower and auditorium. 
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. 
The first number is three: three billion people. 
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States, China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space. 
I've been involved in global warming policy since 1994, when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. 
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.

This was the reality which I saw, and not only one project like that: I saw, I would say, over the years I worked in Africa, I saw hundreds of projects like this. 
I take some solace from Winston Churchill, who put it this way: "The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter) Thank you. 
They spend all this time working on certain problems, but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in, but they can't quite solve. 
America has now elected its first openly black President. 
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems, and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back, so I kept on giving him to the delay list. 
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47. 
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal, of every kind of creature that moves, but no mention about plants. 
A republic. A representative democracy. 
I looked into their strangely angry faces, and I remember wondering, are they wearing rubber masks? 
Well we need a neural interface, a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it's intuitive, it's natural, like for you and I. 
He made restitution and found himself a new job. 
And our prison system itself is stuck. 
You can hear this distribution under that complaint. 
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. 
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds, and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over. 
Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms, trying to do the same thing. 
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles. 
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this. 
And as I left his office, he called me back and he said, "I think it's time. 
And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant. 
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right? 
They go to the clinics, because they want to cure their immediate symptoms, and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions, develop their resources, learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future. 
And just around that time, his mother had said, "Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?" 
(Applause) There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. 
And what we see is that for coastal tags, for those organisms that live near the shoreline, they're most diverse in the tropics. 
Where do these exist? 
We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time. 
The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before, but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scanned, uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and it'd start being fixed. 
So it's a very nice little device. 
So they set out to make San Francisco a no-kill city: create an entire city where every dog and cat, unless it was ill or dangerous, would be adopted, not killed. 
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea. 
It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall. 
Pink. 
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist. 
Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. 
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram. 
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit, but keep the enthusiasm. 
So, that's a challenge, not just for organs but also for tissues. 
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. 
(Laughter) (Video): Ninety. 
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, "You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians." 
And that has to change, you know. 
I apologize for the sexist conversation here, but this is the way it really happened. 
This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. 
That leads to productivity. 
(Laughter) The idea is that basically -- if it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?" 
That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools. 
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years, under the heading of "The Oil Party." 
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. 
What they did, though, is each in their own way, created a different way of navigating your way through technology. 
Thank you. 
And that's how I managed to do it. 
This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ. 
Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary. 
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light. 
What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. 
We're finding that people can share the same spaces, do stuff with vacant space. 
I don't believe that, and I think the situation is changing. 
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM. 
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us. 
I've hinted at them: education and also economic opportunity. 
And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. 
And here's the third factor, which is totally different. 
Imagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass, and the rabbit's going to see a fox. 
(Laughter) And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it, I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. 
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this." 
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time. 
(Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. 
So this turned out to be very simple to do. 
And we looked at three different types of rooms. 
I wanted to live. 
And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills. 
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel, and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with. 
We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions. 
But they have other communication signals they use. 
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc. 
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer." 
As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote, we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us. 
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act, to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. 
But this does not apply the other way around. 
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times." 
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs, some 8,000 miles from the drill site. 
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. 
So that's just to give a sense of scale. 
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years? 
And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell. 
(Laughter) But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren, the universal symbol of beauty and passion. 
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water.

It will make you immortal. 
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other. 
It is made out of silicon. 
Thank you so much. 
And their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers, those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis? 
And one more climber should have died that day, but didn't, and that's Beck Weathers. 
What we have here is one exploit file. 
I said, "Great. What do you do?" 
And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions, and biological evolution kept accelerating. 
I think it adds a huge amount. 
And so it seems that we use our language, not just to cooperate, but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities, and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside. 
There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher: control every conversation and response in the classroom. 
So this technology push, a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up. 
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred. 
So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. 
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. 
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines. 
I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet. 
This is a local company called Vitality, and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time. 
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition, and lying on my mum's sofa, day in day out, watching daytime TV. 
(Laughter) Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater, but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here, about the size of a football, that hit that car and did that damage. 
Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive, and much like Ahmadinejad today, he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel. 
They're going to be small. 
He lived for another 10 years, then the Macedonian faction caught up with him. 
They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime. 
What's the kind of thing you're going to do? 
Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone 500 miles away. 
And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues, when they were dealing with India. 
And my grandfather, he was a wise man, and he saw that as a problem, because he knew that was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports. 
And obviously intentions are not the only thing, so here is another example for one of these applications. 
How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves, when they could be feeding the world? 
Quite the opposite: I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care. 
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets, but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know. 
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard; it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here. 
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting. 
Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery, and because of this worldwide awareness, I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. 
So it holds onto the very last point. 
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. 
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells. 
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal. 
Well when it comes to classical music, there's an awful lot to pass on, much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. 
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth. 
Well, I found a way to use it. 
During this chapter one, there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe, and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it. 
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination. 
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community. 
So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk. 
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material. 
So I don't know what the balance is, but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them. 
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning, because in the beginning were commodities. 
Now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated. 
The crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it, because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion. "Champion," again. 
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. 
What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. 
But I agreed to come and say a few things about this. 
But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. 
The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution -- the gay agenda, if you will. 
This is actually two of my favorites: the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. 
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots. 
So we can then predict where management places should be. 
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
According to an unconfirmed report, a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes. 
I had no practical skills. 
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs. 
Since then, it's happened again in London, it's happening internationally, and across the country. 
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted. 
I think this means basically that they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry. 
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. 
A traditional bone setter is a professional. 
That's my mom and dad. 
The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match. 
But I can taste things. 
We really have two command posts. 
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors. 
(Laughter) In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. 
And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things. 
So we literally are all made out of stardust. 
We need to -- we need to educate. 
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) -- so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks. 
I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it. 
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. 
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. 
But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined. 
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam. 
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot. 
This is Margaret Bourke-White's -- one of her pictures she did. 
Oranges became common in New York. 
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. 
But we dug our heels and said, "We're not in the number game. 
We need people who want to do the right thing. 
Now we've had 50 years of warnings. 
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it. 
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. 
I'm imagining myself as a machine. 
♫ Between those who run to glory ♫ ♫ and those who cannot run ♫ ♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫ ♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫ ♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫ ♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫ In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia, and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel. 
and publishers, so these are not people that usually meet every day, but it's actually doable, and we are on the right track. 
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title. 
I had lost my belief. 
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. 
And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war. 
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. 
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. 
And I was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back-up energy, in case the crisis really came. 
And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil. 
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going. 
Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS. 
We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator. 
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan. 
They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them. 
Small flick, and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side. 
It's value created by the participants for each other. 
You can buy half a billion today, and they are actually better, because they are faster. 
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right? 
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist, where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs, cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers. 
But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. 
But there will also be large fluctuations. 
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. 
Do I do this three times a week? 
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire. 
But it actually doesn't leak. 
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. 
But, oh well. In the end, however, and this is really amazing, for each of those 10 TEDTalk clusters that I submitted, I actually received meaningful summaries. 
You can't say, "Hey, I've got high integrity, invest in me!" Right? 
So there's only one thing left to say. 
We deal in milliseconds. 
And we keep on doing that, slice after slice. 
Within this team there's competition. 
Being numerous does not make you a slave. 
So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster, or an aerospace cluster, but to become a place where people want to be. 
And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call "love at first sight." 
And at 41 hours, this body couldn't make it. 
She always knows where he is, and she doesn't have to be monogamous, because some of these females come up with multiple males attached. 
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. 
Engineers, by moving around a small number of genetic changes, were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch, so that not thousands of people would die, but tens of millions. 
Where will we get the software? 
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. 
Me and you, the investments we are going to be making, the investments the world is going to be making -- that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa. 
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. 
And he's on a mission. 
I always wanted to be outside the box. 
So basically you have a chain of elements. 
And this tells me one of two things. 
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow." 
So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide. 
And it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play. 
We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man. 
Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here, then this rise -- that's the ST elevation. 
So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. 
He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist. 
you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly. 
That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree. 
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about is right over here. Right over here. 
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. 
Now, why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years, trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers? 
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on, and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people, and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. 
Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh. 
So how can we know about the project?

People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. 
A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film, I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better." 
Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict. 
It's voluntary. 
The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is, when you're short of specialized health care professionals, use whoever is available in the community, train them to provide a range of health care interventions, and in these books I read inspiring examples, for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies, diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect. 
They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. 
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips, on contacting a surface, will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain, so that the person feels a sense of touch. 
So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out. 
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. 
And I want to score a point here, because my husband is in the room over there. 
Do we stop there? 
And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day. 
So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. 
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? 
While your cholesterol level has remained the same, the research findings have changed." 
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.) Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for? 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas to see one of Maestro Abreu's great proteges. 
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves, luckily, our courses were converging. 
What's going to follow from that behavior is play. 
So now you may be wondering, why does anyone get married ever? 
And the next steps, like nervous systems and brains, took a few hundred million years. 
And my first thought was, "I've lost it. 
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage. 
They have been around for almost 30 years now, which is quite amazing to think of, but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena. 
But the reality is far from it. 
And they're not happy with this. 
This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria. 
He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. 
But the question is, does forgiveness and redemption replace justice? 
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. 
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera. 
And the winner was actually a group out of MIT, where they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network, where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000 and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it. 
Thank you and God bless you. 
So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song. 
So I asked the Minister over dinner, I said, "Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid -- we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is -- but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water?" 
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it (Laughter), and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. 
We live in a magnetic field. 
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. 
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies. 
We were wrong. Why were we wrong? 
Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it. 
(Laughter) So I've been working on the idea of computation now for more than 30 years, building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on. 
(Laughter) China has many great poets, but we discovered that in the People's Republic public school curriculum, they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng, or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him. 
That's probably this place, which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa. 
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. 
And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize, and we see that it happens. 
I whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere. 
So, again, this idea of workarounds. 
Not a single example of reform has been produced yet. 
Now everybody agrees. 
Why don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"? 
Now I don't know how to do that, but this is TED, and I think the TED community is capable of anything. 
Well, they were just there for 53 hours, and I was there for years. 
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage. 
And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads? 
I could make nothing of that. 
We find this in every country we look at. 
The cabin is open or closed, as you like. 
(Video): So it's day 22. 
If you're involved in anything that's communal, that involves lots of people getting together, there are things for you in religion. 
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. 
You can see this is the left extension. 
(Laughter) And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!" 
It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity, I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower. 
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. 
So think about these two common objects. 
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist. 
You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid. 
So, if it’s true for prostate cancer, it’ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. 
We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. 
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund, we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today. 
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. 
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. 
I thought things in China would be easier, since there was more food. 
Precise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year. 
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background. 
Fashion, whether you like it or not, helps you project who you are to the world. 
We discovered a profusion of life, in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall. 
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it? 
Innovation, creativity, development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone. 
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer? 
Now, China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules. 
But they don't solve humanity's big problems. 
As you can see, it's blocking her vision. 
We looked down at his laminated mug. 
And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world, that seems very unlikely to begin with. 
So, the more tools you have, for Batman, more effective at fighting the bad guys, for us, more tools to attack these kinds of big problems. 
Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it? 
On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world. 
It included an exterior loading dock. 
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit. 
Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh, except in the botanical gardens.

Then he says to himself, very quietly, "[Turbulent the sea,] [Stretching across to Sado] [The Milky Way]." 
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs, and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here, because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that, and some other problems that I won't talk about. 
And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice? 
The first is the fall of Granada, the last Muslim enclave in Europe. 
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. 
We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. 
They have to work together, and they do work together. 
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria. 
This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence?

There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. 
But I kept emailing, saying, "Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet?" 
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it. 
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line. 
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. 
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves. 
CA: OK. 
There is no good faith in this. 
And that's actually very perverse. 
Robotics systems are just incredible these days, absolutely incredible. 
And it was really amazing. 
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. 
There we go -- we're going on a mission. 
Now, imagine for a second these first three types of experiments: mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving. 
They can take a man's life. 
Now, the academics in this audience may think, "Well, that sounds like plagiarism." 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric. 
Also, when you get down there, you find that the water is very, very clear. 
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. 
So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important, the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system. 
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities, which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem, or most of it, whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another. 
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today. 
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. 
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. 
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate, even though they don't know anything about urban planning: To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. 
We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401(k) choices.

All of those things are part of that equation. 
The State Department over here says, "Come on boy, I know you can make it." 
(Applause) And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me, I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. 
Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again? 
How long will it take it to fill it up? 
(Gasps) Oops. Sorry. 
(Laughter) The end of the week came and my translator came back, because I'd asked her to come back, so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun-Sook. 
And she was in horrible pain.

That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. 
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these 80 companies together to help twist the arms of the final 20, to bring them to the table, because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs, they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that, but we all need to be in this together. 
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are -- at least some of the big questions. 
And we used a variety of techniques to do this. 
Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality, calling them fools? 
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky. 
It's more than all our electricity. 
And since my husband is in Istanbul, I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul -- the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different. 
Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works. 
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute. 
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea. 
There are lots of people who care about their freedom. 
And remember, be nice to nerds. 
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain are not purple, showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region, so does his fraternal twin. 
In fact, data is about our lives. 
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right. 
(Applause) Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque? 
We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic. 
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference. 
And the results can be pretty funny. 
Now — (Applause) Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.

So, although that would be really, really awesome, again, that's extremely, extremely impractical. 
Well, he's right, but he didn't say to me, well, you have pre-obesity or you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say, better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol. 
We say it becomes more strongly stratified. 
I figured it out. 
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work." 
And they would recommend other people's stories, and the game became more powerful than the goal. 
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals.

Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. 
I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees and forests, through the medium of science. 
Other people say no, that's not enough, there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens. 
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. 
This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. 
(Laughter) And there were no indulgences around that I could buy. 
But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point. 
Where J&amp;J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect. 
So this is a different approach. 
This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. 
So on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal: low doses of drugs over longer periods of time, side effects friendly to skiing." 
Blue-collar yacht club, where you can join the yacht club, but you've got to work in the boat yard, as sort of condition of membership. 
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life, but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off. 
In the last 20 years I have published a few books, but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006, when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy. 
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me, sometimes I think I confound them. 
With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. 
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond? 
It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. 
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. 
And 70 percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed. 
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists, your own fellow countrymen.

They seduce you. They humiliate you. 
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here, was once a child soldier, under the General's command, until he disobeyed orders, and the General shot off both his legs. 
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. 
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. 
First, starting with a push from the right. 
And the table form is important, and since it's touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab, or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table. 
So people know that it's there. 
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials. 
But look at all the electrodes around it. 
Now people oftentimes say, "Well, magic is just magic." 
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do, as you can imagine, because in museums bones are precious. 
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well, in beautiful, fragile, protected areas like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found. 
SM: Back at Gateshead, a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes. 
Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. 
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993. 
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old. 
Because in the long run, I think there is no reason, no practical reason for newspapers to survive. 
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy. 
And if I wanted to paint on people, well, I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. 
(Laughter) And John Heinz did give me a million bucks. 
Public space. 
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq, and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report. 
The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles. 
That is, you can stack them. 
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model. 
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today. 
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. 
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this? 
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003. 
(Laughter) When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. 
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response. 
You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"? 
But they do also a lot of other remarkable things. 
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. 
We want to play you one more selection. 
The pieces appear and disappear, but maybe more importantly -- this is just looking north from the center of the installation -- they create a field, a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation, a relation with each other and a relation with that limit, the edge, the horizon. 
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. 
And with the material that's left -- because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it, they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school -- I packed it. 
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked." 
We have agency. 
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. 
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born.

He was told that a cure did not exist. 
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object. 
It's a complicated project. 
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. 
It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals.

(Laughter) So, Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor. 
But really the most important question I ever asked, and most of the times when I talk about it, people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty, but I promise you it was the right question. 
We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard. 
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director. 
"No use, went home." (Laughter) "Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?" 
And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. 
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best, or is incinerated. 
It was not that painting, but that painting. 
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
That's the good news. 
And what I want to suggest is that, having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called "I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World," I've been talking to girls for five years, and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb "to please." 
And at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature, and it's called a murmuration. 
I was 19 years old at the time. 
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper? 
Mothers caring for mothers. 
People tell me their lives, their memories, their aspirations, and I create a mindscape. 
I just did things. 
Anyway, you get the idea. 
Okay. And actually of those hands, if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home? 
And that really motivated people to find the best stories. 
But it was important to create a perfect place, so I tried to, in order to work and create. 
It's really about designing from the inside out. 
He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be, and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad. 
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive. 
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks, and use Google Earth in combination with that, you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced, which company is stealing the timber, and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. 
It is a voice we should heed. 
When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode. 
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity, so we hired a feng shui master.

But moving into work -- and we have each week what's called a journal club, when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine. 
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. 
But it was deeper. It was, how much life is there left? 
(Laughter) There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. 
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it. 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that. 
But mostly I'm entranced by it.

So what's the benefit? So what? 
The best culinary experience of my life. 
It's just an incredible device. 
He didn't know what death row meant. 
And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence. 
But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization. 
Now it turns out that these spots also don't change much when the virus mutates. 
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs. 
We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots. 
But I also, in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies, became very concerned about the potential for abuse. 
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it. 
Have a listen. 
Ah! I know where I can shoot that. 
And here you see a dead duck. 
But it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation. 
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. 
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return. 
There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people. 
So, these little details help to make it work, make it real. 
So again, real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus, and therefore we can take out another dinosaur. 
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house, and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet. 
And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. 
The understanding is very low. 
I was frightened of her. I felt like a child. 
Interestingly, the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down, because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs. 
For example, in the United States alone, there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language. 
And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go. 
"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon on the day you were born, you would be all done in only one more year? 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. 
I have worked with women and for women all my life. 
So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story by using these abstract statistics. 
So my ask is this: Go online, find these simple best practices, find out how to update and patch your computer. 
And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent, which is twice as much as in other countries but, as taxes go, hardly crippling. 
Thank you. 
And then, of course, to bring us to today. 
Otherwise you're in trouble. 
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. 
And they thought about it and they said, "Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here." 
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 -- I'm surprised it was a quarter -- 90 percent thought that this last election was honest. 
And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country, in their minds they were fighting a jihad, they were doing jihad, and they named themselves the Mujahideen, which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.

These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe. 
You know, one word: Tunisia. 
And then if you have something you're proud of, you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.

Each time I get a wall in New York, I use his photos to continue spreading the project. 
They're happy. They are satisfied. 
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food. 
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors, just pulsing all of these colors. 
What does the word "public" mean today anyway? 
You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate? 
But forget her breasts. 
(Applause) Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. 
The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun. 
(Laughter) Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites. 
And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip. 
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends, classmates from everywhere, many of whom are still dear friends to this day. 
There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick, concrete with a void interior. 
So that was the 20th century. 
They aren't told by their boss or anyone, they just do it. 
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium? 
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about. 
This is him in a pressure suit. 
What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding -- although as you can see that's pretty amazing, this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them. 
You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know, and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. 
We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. 
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built. 
Where do we like to kiss people? 
They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive? 
They've discovered a new bond, a new material for transparent solar cells. 
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. 
Its head is down. It's walking backwards. 
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different. 
There are other questions that are tough. 
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. 
What's the origin of this? 
So right now, I feel more like these are my principles, and if you don't like them, I have others. 
And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. 
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen. 
I contacted a company in the States who make suits for NASA. 
And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President. 
So that worked. So booya for Scott. 
It's something like life, that once you get in it you can't get out. 
In conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer. 
But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently. 
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier. 
You know, back in 2000, we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers, and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000, that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. 
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it. 
And so in the second flight, we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it. 
And he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed, also for the authorities here, that Gary McKinnon -- who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon -- suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression. 
Lifespan has increased to 78. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you. 
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence -- popular support for the government. 
So what was wrong with that myth, and with all pre-scientific thinking, and what, then, made that momentous difference? 
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery. 
So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare -- (Laughter) — we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do. 
(Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? 
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. 
Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there, she takes care of me. 
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach. 
The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system; it can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions. 
You don't plan the details, and people will figure out what to do, how to adapt to this new framework. 
It didn't even talk about cutting emissions, which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem. 
You didn't trust information very much. 
All right, so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind. 
It's the beginning. 
So this is a single chromosome. 
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. 
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness." 
I live there. 
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. 
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation. 
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting. 
So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. 
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now. 
And what we found is very exciting. 
You know, where did these things come from? 
It's a children's book for the iPad. 
They don't know that she's dead. 
And we probably need, well, we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest. 
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry. 
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. 
Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. 
Don't you want to look? 
It's whatever takes my fancy, really. 
You know, they might have a solution. 
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. 
And I will go you one further. 
And I figured, this has to stop. 
(Laughter) There it is. 
In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. 
Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape. 
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for 150 feet. 
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened. 
This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings. 
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. 
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. 
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head. 
And the situation it describes is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man -- finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. 
We actually do it all the time. 
(Laughter) Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. 
But I also see lots of poverty, and it's quite jarring, both in the scale and the scope of it. 
That is not too much, is it? 
It has these strong, heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. 
I automatically wanted to see this ship, this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory, and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory, basically go back to what it looks like. 
It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. 
There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. 
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. 
See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45, it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny." 
That flow of mental images is mind. 
That's 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn't ship to the Middle East. 
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. 
So there has been a lot of change. 
They're not just possible; they're critical. 
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. 
But before the Apollo program ended, 24 men flew to the moon. 
It really involves many different areas. 
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside, so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad. 
I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people. 
And I thought, "Great. 
And the hardest part about that is probably the light, because it means you have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world. 
And in fact, it probably won't. 
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two ... 
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda, the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations. 
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. 
(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set, you just get them out. 
And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records -- in the United States, we're still less than 20 percent electronic. 
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. 
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. 
Now, let me -- I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks. Consider that content, in a sense. 
And I thought, "How could it? Because I've lost everything that I valued, everything that I'd worked towards. 
Younger people don't. 
This was the full size of the original creature. 
It can follow chemical gradients. 
Well, we're securing them, and it would be great if we could burn them, eat them up, and this reactor loves this stuff. 
Ethnic Albanians had been murdered, their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported. 
This product, it has two cameras. 
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time. 
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. 
We've done it for many patients now, and we can say that they're all independent infections. 
And yet, I would like to think that I am more than my genes. 
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things. 
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots. 
And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye. 
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar, and also picking up some powder on its leg, and going off to the next blossom. 
But if we manage not to be frightened by it, it's also stimulating. 
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me what was I doing, and I explained. 
Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world?" 
They came from computer scientists, engineers. 
And here we have the plan out to 2030. 
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. 
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun, and then he made laser sounds. 
(Laughter) He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years? 
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food. 
How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it? 
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside. 
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. 
And it has no DNA. 
But one day, something happened. 
And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and then it plays back automatically. 
Recently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love. 
And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape; we can use any seed shape we like. 
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble. 
The title of my talk: Shape-shifting Dinosaurs: The Cause of a Premature Extinction. 
Voice: What kind of disease? 
And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects. 
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. 
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. 
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support. 
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?" 
So for example, you could turn one into a football, or another one into a sun. All I’m interested in is quantity. 
Do it. 
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this. 
And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law. 
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. 
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game, and we played it virtually every day. 
Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. 
I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network, a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. 
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. 
It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. 
We make certain things harder and easier to do. 
And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. 
The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. 
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients, but impatients, because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. 
Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations. 
They had never paid him any attention before -- old man, small mosque -- but now they began to pay visits, and sometimes they would drag him in for questions, and always the same question: "Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad? 
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa, you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life. 
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free, and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. 
That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes. 
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child. 
is not something that's the same or fungible among people. 
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework. 
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer, and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning. 
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways. 
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it. 
At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. 
So this was before the computer was invented. 
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. 
Recently, I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta. 
It really helped me to design it. 
And that's exactly what I'm saying. 
This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you. 
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. 
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth. 
How can we escape [having] a double-standard, if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time How will we ever be interlocutors? 
SB: Pardon? 
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering," so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom. 
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. 
And she said -- I'll never forget -- "It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time." 
But they're also very high pressure, so they're dangerous. 
(Music) Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with. 
It's fucking freezing. 
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung is something very ill-defined. 
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. 
Responsible in front of him. 
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died. 
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter) To give you an idea of how slowly, it had about 1k of memory. 
But to me, the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering. 
One we all know about, the population explosion: the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years. 
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. 
We were on the stage and then -- by the way, spectacular. 
They look for the most interesting content in the English language. 
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto, and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother, but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes -- and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too. 
In education, medicine, law, diplomacy, government, business and the media that exist today. 
Because for those of us who live in democracies, or in aspiring democracies, the law begins with us. 
In times of change we need new alternatives, new ideas. 
No to barrier walls. On February 5th, concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters. 
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city. 
And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers. 
That was my story. Thank you very much. 
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. 
I tell them my story, that I am HIV-positive, but my child is HIV-negative. 
And we've learned that, in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants, is different as ants perform different tasks. 
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day. 
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused? 
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana." 
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, probably, again, there would be no life. 
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't. 
Business generates those resources when it makes a profit. 
Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off. 
But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine. 
And then you can see the inside of the heart. 
So it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason, have incredibly low diversity. 
Gershwin died at the age of 38. 
And that love makes us want to be around him, even now. 
This comes out. This comes out. 
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. 
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed, because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine. 
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks. 
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar. 
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco." 
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. 
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug? 
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses. 
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it. 
That lets me know the context. 
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through. 
I also like rock and roll. 
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. 
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe. 
(Applause) EMC: Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. 
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?" 
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery. 
Riccardo Muti, please. 
This was in 1968, I guess it was. 
But even black holes don't last forever. 
No stone left unturned. 
The first attempt didn't go so well. 
But to me, they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story. 
We're putting them together in unusual ways, and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. 
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together -- anti-government, pro-government, Christian, Muslim, of course, English-speaking, well, you name it. 
As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects very, very small-scale personal stories. 
Cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them. 
And I often show this to senior management. 
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars. 
And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap. 
So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity, but even more, we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. 
Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it. 
So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife. 
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. 
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected. 
The young man's name was Evariste Galois. 
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. 
Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. 
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible. 
And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say, "Know, the district is trying to impose this, but you have the freedom to do otherwise." 
You can also compress that into a building block, as they did here. 
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement, we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement, for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge. 
Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time. 
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search this data? How do I process this data?" 
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil." 
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt, and in fact, they get exactly within, you know, within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old, the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. 
This is a physics and information theory term. 
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions, it was these teenagers that fed the crew. 
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories: where an ant is foraging, when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back. 
I thought, oh my gosh. 
Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it. 
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm, as you saw already, but it also goes well beyond that. 
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle. 
He came up with a name for his mystery agent. 
There's a new library across the river. 
Like even people in convenience stores saying, "Have a nice day," when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. 
But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. 
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it. 
Find out what they are. 
They had never really thought about starting up a business. 
There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand looking at post-earthquake development housing, and thanks to the TED city Prize, we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas to set up a kind of community factory and micro-university. 
Can we find a solution to produce more? 
Now, this has been realized for some time. 
That realization is extraordinarily corrosive, extraordinarily corrupting. 
(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters) These are played mainly in small rooms. 
(Laughter) Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there. 
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks. 
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute, the people who put the questionnaire. 
Blithering fucking idiots. 
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. 
As have this guy's. 
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance, early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active. 
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. 
You'd like to see a colony on Mars. 
People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children, and the better alternatives that exist. 
Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice? 
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. 
That's kind of like what we're at. 
I think most of us are going to glance at it, and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it. 
But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true. 
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun. 
If you figure out what up and down really are, it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything, but then you add in sideways. 
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous. 
But even as morality binds people together into a unit, into a team, the circling blinds them. 
We're crocheting a coral reef. 
And a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements. 
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. 
So the water is churned through this raft. 
In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests. 
That's what emergence means. 
So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me, and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. 
And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. 
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth, and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons. 
We'd been studying these fish, but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. 
A robot. 
Well, they kept them alive. 
(Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms? 
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. 
The first thing you do as a scientist is, you make sure stuff works. 
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down? 
And we thought, I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people. 
There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door. 
We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles. 
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group, cheating went up. 
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation. 
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. 
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. 
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little. 
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day. 
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. 
And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. 
Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length. 
And the truth is, I'm not quite there. 
In my own life, I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball. 
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars. 
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. 
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before, but one thing we like to say in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth. 
You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this? 
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this. 
For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology. 
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [it was necessary] for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake. 
And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. 
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. 
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. 
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure, this new fire is flameless. 
I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more. 
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"] An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do. 
No. Contrary to what's usually said, testability is common, in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. 
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan. 
Okay, so when that happens everything lines up. 
Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate. 
And in terms of the line of poetry, why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit? 
This is my brother, Jonny. He's 10, and he plays the banjo. 
At 12. 
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started: take a mucus sample. 
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common, the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking, linking seemingly unrelated ideas, such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun." 
Government? Forget about it! 
Think about it, that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago. 
The wax printer does what looks like printing. 
So in Lebanon, we enrolled the newspaper editors, and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page, addressing the issue affecting Lebanon, like religion in politics and everyday life. 
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. 
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes, space looks finite to us. 
You interact with them. 
But we know that art imitates life, and it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal. 
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act. 
Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about. 
It gives objects what's called incentive salience. 
"You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. 
It's three proteins -- Ras, Myc and P53. 
And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right? 
And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. 
Life is too complex for... 
But you see, we haven't gone very far. 
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children, who provide an environment but not genes to their kids, we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. 
This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests. 
Social media didn't create the revolution; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore. 
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs, and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that these people, instead of dismissing their fears, these people read them closely, they studied them, and then they translated that fear into preparation and action. 
You just have to believe me, it is, it is. 
All wealth is actually created by business. 
(Applause) Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please? 
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products. 
It was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey. 
Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up. 
So was Mother Teresa. 
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people. 
Cymatics is accessible to everybody. 
You've probably heard of it. 
We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. 
But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life. 
Of course, it's this big. 
So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content. And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game, there's an editor for in the game that the player can create, all the way up through civilization. This is my baby. 
But e-miles follow Moore's Law. 
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate. 
They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business. 
Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through. 
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. 
And you know what? 
I began doing tasks around the house. 
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. 
But instead of what it is, our focus was on the way it worked. 
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for. 
There are a million ways. 
But it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously. 
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen, if I share the information with whatever device that I have, could inform you about what is going on, and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture of what's going on. 
He told me not to tell anyone. 
So we've digitized those and made those available. 
He told them everything he could about Lincoln. 
So they just started spreading this on the land around, and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. 
If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu. 
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. 
In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. 
And that's very frustrating. 
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. 
It was an offering, an invitation. 
I was very limited by my condition, physically. 
We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern. 
But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us. 
It was about two meters high, completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake. 
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand. 
(Laughter) And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her. 
A couple of years later, I meet them. 
Because everyone was a hero. 
The issue is not urban poverty. 
Pain is 120. 
This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. 
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life. 
Others very high on our list of regrets include career, romance, parenting, various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time -- or actually more specifically, how we fail to spend our leisure time. 
I didn't give up, and there was action behind these words. 
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way. 
So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then, often. 
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said, this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs. 
It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. 
To just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we're using now and how they integrate calculus: the fact that they're calculus-based means that we don't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements. 
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle, and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed. 
What can we do with that guy's data? 
And I thought, go figure. 
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents. 
But finally, there's a hotel there. 
(Laughter) So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research. 
So universal access to all knowledge -- I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind, like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria. 
Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once, "What are you doing for a living?" 
He then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment. 
Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. 
But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor, the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow. 
Our hands are amazing instruments. 
So the whole "Hells and Heavens" is about free will and determinism. 
And breathability is good. 
Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it. 
This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition, including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com, which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter) On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article -- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here -- but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written, including the controversies over body image and commercialization, the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc. 
The law, on the other hand, can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists, but it isn't. 
And there it is on the shelves. 
But since then, much progress has been made, both in our lab and other labs around the world. 
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it, we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide. 
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world. 
Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. 
Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. 
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair, skin and nails -- and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms. 
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?" 
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow. 
Open it up. 
And because we can, we must. 
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better. 
You don't need that much up there. 
They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out." 
You guessed it: world peace. 
You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. 
He's going down the path. 
And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened, there's something in it, some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. 
This next is the Sudanese girl, a few moments from death, a vulture hovering in the background, a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty. 
They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. 
We can really go for it. 
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply labeled as madness. 
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected. 
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years, and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places, wild things, certainly wildlife, and the amazing qualities that penguins have. 
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. 
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it. 
Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value, because value is evidenced like never before. 
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break. 
"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object, but not our life?" 
Because we never talk to the people in these countries. 
Absolutely not. 
Now, this is really special cork, and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience. 
You can see all of this. 
Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child. 
Here's a really cool problem. I like this. 
This is what your office should look like, is part of my message here. 
They don't have another thing they can do. 
We have more trials planned for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer. 
And we know that there are more. 
It's actual useful. It's got value. 
I was born premature. I was always very small. 
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason, which is itself punishable by death. 
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. 
They didn't -- they was not looking on me. 
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth. 
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do. 
You'd probably kick me out, or something. 
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering." 
China drops to 124th. 
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing, rebuild everything from the bottom up, using DNA in ways that nature never intended, using DNA origami, and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly. 
He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off. 
He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy. 
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings. 
And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device. 
Kismet: (Nonsense) Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. 
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm. 
Lack of education was their way to control power. 
Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford. 
We will see 30,000 new infected websites. 
Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, "I rest my case." 
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon. 
Already today, you don't need to go to your physician in many cases. 
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women. 
Rather, it teaches us when and how to act. 
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof of the Yale Law School, I began to sing, and not quietly either. 
So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. 
That's all it is. OK? 
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign. 
And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span -- and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night, and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time. 
That's very important. 
And this is so obvious, in a way, because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done. 
And last but not least, none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. 
That's the way to handle this. 
We see rocks. 
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation. 
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. 
We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia, even though ecosystem services -- these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free -- they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP -- two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent -- but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor, the answers are more like 45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent. 
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are. 
It has the same conditions as the human body -- 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen. 
I got what you're thinking. 
In the 1950s, people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. 
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. 
Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. 
I'll give you a couple seconds. 
(Laughter) And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you." 
Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant? 
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do, and depending on the conditions, we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. 
So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems, a million star systems, looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. 
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, "Hey guy, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?" 
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years, and I started asking questions, and that’s when my political education started. 
The big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull, because the future's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation, not a single algorithm. 
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. 
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity. 
No, I just spit out a tooth. 
(Laughter) And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color, so I decided to do a little experiment. 
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. 
And it looks really good. 
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. 
IM: Yeah, it is, exactly. 
They're no good either. 
Cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity. 
We want beauty; we don't just want function. 
In some ways, art can change the world. 
We take a microscope slide. 
Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves -- hopefully that search will work. 
And also, I thought that there would be synthetic polymers, plastics, embedded in the rock. 
And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. 
Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. 
They like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies. 
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism. 
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. 
Is it that I articulate very well? 
We need new tools and new approaches. 
But we have an opportunity. 
And in my book, I went into that question as well. 
"That's right," he said. "We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated." 
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter) That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, "miscellaneous technical senses." 
I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do, to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact, and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. 
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing." 
It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please. 
It must always be in motion. 
You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow. 
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking. 
(Applause) This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. 
That's me with the funny gloves. 
We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early. 
You can't make that one up. 
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the very, very north end of it there, where it's absolutely freezing cold. 
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good, which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. 
You smell money." 
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. 
Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles, the cars and light trucks, because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one. 
(Laughter) RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which -- CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we -- it was a TEDster event there, I think. 
What you call them actually affects how you react to them, viscerally and morally. 
Now they get three apple cubes. 
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism. 
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. 
And, at the same time, water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen, doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert. 
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations, what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. 
I don’t really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted. 
If you look at the roof of the Eden Project, or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure. 
I just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging, and we're making some real progress. 
And I'm not going to give you the patois translation; I'm going to make it standard English. 
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one." 
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth, zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year. 
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago, which is related to the fact that I never -- and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters, there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand, but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific, technical, entertainment career as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools. 
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there. 
I mean, these people had nothing, and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up, but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere, and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own, so that now they do the same back-breaking work, but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it, and they do it in freedom. 
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. 
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. 
And there's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. 
His photo was remembered by all of us. 
Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left. 
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page? 
What we're trying to do, or what we believe, because this is how we believe the world really works, is that without the environment you have nothing. 
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well -- very important bird nesting site, some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world. 
It's the hollowing out of small towns. 
And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider. 
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us. 
(Laughter) Because of course, there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy, so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter) Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine. 
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. 
What's your view on that? 
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people. 
So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. 
And she said, "What on Earth for?" 
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big. 
Now, consider religion -- in this case Islam, which is the religion that, in some direct sense, can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. 
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together. 
And that it wasn't until 2009, when President Obama signed off on a surge, that we finally had, in the words of Secretary Clinton, "the strategy, the leadership and the resources." 
They are still protesting. 
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes. 
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said, "When you met him, you knew it was him." 
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it. 
They wanted to stir up controversy. 
And it turns out that men and women report very, very similar levels of happiness. 
I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. 
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. 
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on that African Savannah, pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death? 
So, these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS. 
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society. 
This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy, and when you eliminate diplomacy, you make war inevitable. 
What's next for us? 
Horrible chest pain. 
Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but — (Laughter) — I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure. 
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. 
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level. 
Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you. 
But as I said, the military and the police are very different. 
they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital; or the new parents, the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability, and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential, are told by the doctors, "Forget her, leave her in the institution, go home and make a healthy one." 
It's that little green sliver on the horizon, which makes them very nervous about rising oceans. 
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. 
The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot. 
So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it. 
See, why not? We celebrate birthdays, where all you have to do is not die for 365 days — (Laughter) — and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it. 
A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. 
And he says, "Oh." He bows. 
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. 
And it works just like it does in the animal. 
It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see." 
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation. 
But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling, much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. 
I mean, it was incredible. 
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. 
The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative; like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time. 
And at a million dollars each, that would be about 12 billion dollars. 
This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on? 
I love these Gallianos. 
(Laughter) So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness? 
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women. 
Or I'd make eye contact with everyone -- that was really creepy; that didn't work at all. 
We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater, not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. 
So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses. 
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years. 
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ... 
He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. 
We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. 
They are stuck in their intellectual patch. 
(Laughter) But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career -- it brought me a lot of success. 
I would give my viewpoints to people. 
And within that context, we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives. 
Now, what's great about this is anybody can do this. 
Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time? 
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go." 
Now, if you're playing doubles, then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you, because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win -- or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose. 
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system. 
It's the ones that play more. 
We had to beat the European monarchy. 
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good. 
Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies? 
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House." 
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off. 
Essentially, there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live. 
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life." 
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. 
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic. 
And then they're up again at eight in the morning. 
It's too risk-averse. 
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2. 
So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her. 
(Laughter) Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. 
I was born in a little village called Gando. 
(Applause) If you are a blind child in India, you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news. 
And then Spock turns round, he goes, "James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don't believe this is one of them in the category." 
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology. 
In the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him." 
This, graphically, was the answer. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part. 
And it was unstable without its tail. 
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. 
This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. 
I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai. 
There's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter) Number three -- isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter) A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs ever since there have been people, and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand. 
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise, size-wise, ease of use, complexity ... 
As we spread out around the world, we developed thousands of different languages. 
Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer. 
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free; it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons. 
So you may be wondering: these are beautiful laboratory experiments, do they really apply to real life? 
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives? 
You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic. 
(Applause) Go save a life of a child. 
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. 
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class. 
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large. 
No, that's not true. 
The universe and life are both in space and time. 
This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles. 
We're able to drive down area 25, down to a more normal level, and we're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain, and indeed we're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression. 
(Applause) I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one. 
And we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way, in fact, you do it is what's shown here. 
In fact, talk about technology imitating life imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around. 
I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. 
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had. 
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone, so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. 
So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. 
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article. 
So I'll show you the next movie. 
And the third thing I said on that beach was, "It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world, and in many ways, of course, it is, and in other ways, and the most important ways, it's a team, and if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie." 
But it's a very important role. 
And because God loves her, I did get married. 
And indeed, we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time. 
This is a little stone ball, floating. 
What will these three billion people bring? 
So, without this technology you can't see the stars. 
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. 
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. 
He's never going to look at me. 
And if I make a comparison with oil, there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming, yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. 
(Laughter) And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back, is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing? 
(Laughter) Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource. 
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old, I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete, over four months, slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst. 
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there. 
The second is, we're human. 
He thought I was mad enough anyway. 
It's great stuff. 
You're making a connection with your audience over here, and you always want to do a one-on-one connection. 
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries. 
And he was interested, effectively, in what he could do with those concrete objects. 
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap. 
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans, but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information, so I made a Kickstarter, which is a crowd-fundraising platform, and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars. 
Other subjects came up almost never, including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life: 10 or 15 workers in one room, 50 people sharing a single bathroom, days and nights ruled by the factory clock. 
I got about 3,000 emails. 
But more and more, in cases of DNA profiling -- this is another one -- we expect juries, who are ordinary people -- and it's documented they're very bad at this -- we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on. 
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people, especially if they were disproportionately Jewish? 
Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?" 
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. 
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed. 
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on. 
More importantly, they prepare it for inspection and analysis by 27 independent laboratories in the United States and Europe, who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals related to climate, some in parts per quadrillion. 
You step out of line, you get punished. 
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. 
One strand can be copied directly, and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. 
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet, collectively, through collective wisdom. 
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit -- there's ego involvement, they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome, or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome. 
So, I started collecting found objects. 
This is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city. 
Here's what I think is going on. 
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more. We like more. 
This time, not only did my collectors disappear, the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. 
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions, of course. 
So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. 
I assure you, it is very true. 
(Laughter) But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning. 
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered, and that's because they need to be kept cold. 
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. 
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. 
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. 
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007. 
And then Egypt started, and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. 
So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer, everything's going to get lit up. 
And he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health, I know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer." 
Look at it now. 
And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. 
Pedestrian zones, congestion fees, emission limits in cities like California cities have, there's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act. 
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art. 
So people really do learn a language. 
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice, I was blogging live from my tent, sending back a little diary piece, sending back information on the distance I'd covered -- the ice conditions, the temperature -- and a daily photo. 
Or wait to capture the second half of it. 
And that's the symbol of their culture. 
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. 
First you trap atoms in a special bottle. 
So at first what we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet, but then over time -- I can speed it up just a little bit -- we'll actually see the heat impact of that as well. 
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that. 
The last thing that I would just like to say, when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like, they almost inevitably say the same thing. 
And it turns out to be structured as follows. 
And their politics are not entirely unattractive. 
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting, Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan, Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there, Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration. 
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick, paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease. 
We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. 
And this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox. 
I was asked to design the building, because the theme of the expo was environmental issues. 
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?" 
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies. 
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. 
As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs. 
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people -- to house, for example, the chronically sick. 
She's being filmed with a hidden camera. 
By 1913, these 10 countries, plus the United States, controlled vast global empires -- 58 percent of the world's territory, about the same percentage of its population, and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share of global economic output. 
Let's go back to high school physics here. 
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition. 
And that's why we think the animals live longer. 
Habits, certainties, convictions, exclamation marks, paradigms, dogmas. 
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure. 
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another. 
Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. 
They become leaders within their communities. 
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting. 
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle. 
For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky. 
Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. 
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions. 
Well the British government did a model of telecommuting. 
So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much, but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently. 
So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters. 
The red dots are the children we have not treated. 
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless. 
I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. 
Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. 
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen. 
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim, and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night, and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done, the trainer says, "That's great. 
And in the future, as we go forward, we will, of course, experience terrible things. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
We need to focus on reducing the oil. 
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. 
I'm going to talk about a new, old material that still continues to amaze us, and that might impact the way we think about material science, high technology -- and maybe, along the way, also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. 
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. 
And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish, which has something to do with this. 
Thankfully, I was able to answer A, and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening. 
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago, after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite, and that's the one you see on the left in there. 
So then if you try to ask questions: "What's the surface of a cauliflower?" 
And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do. 
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me; to create something that has never been, a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits. 
But I heard about a congressman who had a very, very different point of view. 
It was able to do that itself. 
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines? 
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. 
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer. 
And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. 
What on earth is wrong with placebos? 
There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps, and even environmental monitoring crowd maps. 
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me. 
So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea. 
So you don't have to tell what latitude, longitude you're at, you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is, you don't have to tell what orientation. 
But what really causes an effect is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it, but before it gets to you, it's thoroughly washed." 
So for instance, it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. 
It's wonderful. 
What's number one? 
But also, Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. 
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago. 
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things. 
I mean, they want to know what you're up to. 
I want that to happen. 
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing. 
It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users, came from young users, particularly a group in Northern California, who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes, which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode, or your big brother, and they're very glamorous. 
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out. 
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you. 
It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse, you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. 
There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot. 
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. 
We feel so good about ourselves. 
To me, the pace of political changes is too slow, too gradual. 
And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity. 
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin. 
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it. 
If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example, we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go. 
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature. 
To test water, you simply insert a sample and, within seconds, it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water, or a green light, indicating the sample is safe. 
If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence that you have stolen. 
Oop. (Laughs) Mental note right there. Again, we'll get back to that. 
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things, just something that's exquisitely beautiful, that's universally beautiful. 
Well notation not only passed the music on, notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely, because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. 
But nowhere else anyway. 
And so, they're joining China, whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been both defensive and offensive. 
With United Architects, also, we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system, but this time in a much more monolithic mass, like a sphere. 
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. 
Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring. 
I just know that that's a front in this war. 
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola, and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities. 
Right? Move. The car goes past you. 
Think of it like this. 
Jealousy likes photos. 
Because I also, I'm going to admit to you, I also thought, "How can I be like a hot-shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this? 
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam, aka JiLsi -- founder of DarkMarket, born in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. 
I promise, you'll love it. 
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things, so he starts chocolate-dipping edges, changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity. 
And every year, 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually. 
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity. 
There's a company in Boston called Nanex, and they use math and magic and I don't know what, and they reach into all the market data and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms. 
It's so simple, and we thought, you know, okay, it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year. 
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009. 
And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. 
(Laughter) I thought that was an old one. 
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter) I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent. 
(Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution? 
And he said, "Go home, because if you miss his first tooth, if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself. 
And I had the same reaction you did. 
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages, and I want to call that "pinch a minnow, hurt a whale." 
But after some time, after some months, one day as I was going out and about, suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies. 
Some of you in this middle section -- you have red/green paddles. 
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Later, later, later." 
We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities." 
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. 
The best part, it took only $200 dollars to make the first prototype. 
Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so— Man: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known— Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud. 
DR: It was not an inclusive group. 
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future. 
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken. 
(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. 
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. 
This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday. 
So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. 
We were peer-learning, we were engineering, we were making things, prototyping, but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible, to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from. 
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet; it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it? 
And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. 
(Laughter) So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. 
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day." 
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly. 
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there. 
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. 
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer. 
Yet, if you analyze the common man, he or she does not wake up every day and say, "Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today." 
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations. 
I'll tell you right up front, this is a trade off. 
Now, she is oblivious to me, and I am so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you. 
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both. 
My skill is not in the mathematics. 
I went out and did a lit review, 3,000 articles on the key word "slavery." 
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space. 
And to make matters even worse, most of the text that we have are extremely short. 
It's two panels 13 ft. high. 
We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone. 
You can step on the scale. 
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes, great successes. 
But ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds. 
Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms. 
That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation, and carry a bowie knife in my mouth, and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them, and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water. 
This is European space agency Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water, we have ice. 
I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one. 
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce. 
Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane. 
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive. 
Why on Earth would someone do that? 
And it turns out, we've even done it. 
I was 28 years old. 
No, I'm sorry. 
That's called "rounding." 
Timesharing is a little further off in the future. 
And, sadly, we don't know. 
It's been a remorseless, steady increase. 
She stands with 10,000 arms, and in every hand, there is an instrument of liberation, and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes, and these are the eyes of wisdom. 
For example, the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor, defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. 
We're learning how to become like them. 
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general, if you can remember the kindness of your own mother, if you can remember the kindness of your spouse, or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children. 
(Laughter) So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. 
And a team of about two or three people, working together, can build this. 
In the New Jersey data, which is different, because it's not just fatal crashes, but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported, it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries, but generally they're the minor injuries. 
These stories saturated my cells and nerves, and to be honest, I stopped sleeping for three years. 
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop, and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. 
When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere. 
You know, when most people think about the diet I recommend, they think it’s a really strict diet. 
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there. 
It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB, saying, "Please come help. 
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. 
You put together machines and water, and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- (Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you end up with systems that look like this. 
Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always, as we get macro and talk commodities. 
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses. 
That's true. 
So in the lower right here, you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh; Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat; CC the cat, for cloned cat; Snuppy, the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not. 
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility. 
A third of all the people commute by bike. 
That means we can do it again. 
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question. 
It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians. 
And he started yelling at me, and I said to the translator, "OK, tell him to calm down, what is he saying?" 
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. 
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. 
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it, and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath. 
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart, and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants. 
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. 
There are no essential Africans, and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from, and yet we want to make profound statements about it. 
We thought that was a good time to announce it. 
General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. 
And I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village, they were one of the most respected families in the village. 
It's two breeding cycles for maize. 
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. 
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history. 
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies, the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world. 
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work, a few projects that we've worked on. 
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence, this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new." 
Alarm: Threat imminent. 
(Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? 
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds, and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds, and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds. 
(Applause) Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. 
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting. 
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. 
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. 
Our social lives in the future depend on that. 
This is a courtyard in Europe, and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play. 
This one doesn't have the video in it, but you get a little feel from what it can do. 
I failed to do this. 
This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. 
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both. 
You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. 
There was data within the streams of news that we consume. 
And we allowed users, readers, two places where they could contribute to the paper: the letters page, where they could write a letter in, and we would condescend to them, cut it in half, and print it three days later. 
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents -- (Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath. 
Another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater, the whole thing -- and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment, that I heard the word tracheotomy. 
And then I thought about how, much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God, probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy. 
AK: I was able to get four. 
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. 
I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why? 
I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this. 
So there are examples like this in medicine -- doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education, so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy, which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. 
(Laughter) Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. 
Yet, these men remain dead. 
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit. 
They're excitatory. 
And what narrative, what history, what identity, what moral code are we imparting to our young? 
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here, it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies. 
The most popular blogger -- it's not me -- it's a movie star, and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans. 
managing this system. 
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, left for dead in parking lots, acid burned in their kitchens. 
"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place, Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn, I met you first last Tuesday morn. 
(Laughter) Oh, man. Um, yes. 
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models -- there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. 
I'm -- The first time you do something, it's science. 
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills. 
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil, and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years. 
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. 
Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children? 
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts, but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads. 
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. 
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. 
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of growing population. We're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine, probably nine and a half before we're done. 
The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on. 
And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation, this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. 
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today." 
If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though, I wouldn't have that luxury. 
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach, you don't always end up in a place like this. 
We're on our way to solving -- the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it, and that's the environmental issue, but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock. 
When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. 
The queen does it all. 
So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range. 
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules? 
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula, this meant the subjects loved their iPhones. 
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved, how they walked around, and how they lived and grew up. 
We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it. 
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. 
And according to Fortune magazine, he's worth 700 million dollars. 
What is the future of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy? 
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale. 
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole, even though you think it's black, it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. 
When I do a trick at a party -- (Laughter) that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again. 
If you look at disability, as measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years, it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist, except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes, and as you can see, virtually 30 percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders, neuropsychiatric syndromes. 
But she told the students to sit down. 
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world. 
It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them. 
So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. 
But what's interesting is, I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport, even though it says, "Born in Iran." No problems. 
It's a bit like a huge jumping jack, and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. 
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China. 
That's why we need care from our parents. 
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars, but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know, in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of, a little bit of what's going to happen. 
(Laughter) This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually. 
The places being rented out are things that you might expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes, but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access: treehouses, teepees, airplane hangars, igloos. 
Well, if you have a high-speed camera, and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around, pretty soon somebody does this. 
And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK? 
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. 
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute. 
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same, while your bone is healing, for example. 
Again, talking about fate, I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art. 
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. 
We had to see the world through her eyes. 
This is Jonas. 
Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. 
This is all the contents of a Japanese home. 
He's got it; it's in his pocket. 
A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. 
It's about the nuance of human language. 
I don't believe it. 
Because we are the environment, and how we treat each other is really how we’re going to treat the environment. 
Now, that's an awful lot of bees. 
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover. 
If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them, you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market. 
We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. 
Think about this: Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets. 
The hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers. 
If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it, it's probably not play. 
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ∇ Sτ"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc² for intelligence that I've seen. 
There's only one exception to this universal law, and that is the human spirit, which can continue to evolve upwards -- the staircase -- bringing us into wholeness, authenticity and wisdom. 
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. 
(Applause) The best is yet to come -- so in a second. 
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, "Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens." 
I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars. 
And that grew to 160,000 students from 209 countries. 
So next card will be -- was it five? 
They get paid by pollen and nectar, to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower. 
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them? 
They're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do. 
(Applause) What I learned from the yo-yo is, if I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible. 
I said, "Welcome to Green School." 
Most of us worry about things we can't control, like war, terrorism, the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti. 
Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio. 
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. 
And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium, the air, into another density of medium, water, without a splash. Look at this picture. 
And they get inside, and they get it all on. 
Everything comes out of a point; you have infinite density. And all the equations break down. 
I don't know, but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding. 
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank, I learned about the Torre David, a 45-story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. 
And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. 
And that's her dad. 
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. 
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here: Pogo's been quoted; Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out. 
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound, like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles. 
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college. 
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. 
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine. 
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year. 
So good luck. We're all in this with you. 
And we won this World Cup in 1983. 
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions, and see that it's quite pretty. 
We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent: the valuable resource of the imagination. 
This is how the ad ran throughout the world; Germany made one slight change in the ad. 
(Laughter) Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. 
I don't know how to prevent that, but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response." 
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden. 
We've all had a heartache. 
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. 
We need to make the world a smaller place. 
Right up to us, like right up to here. 
We are interacting with our entertainment. 
Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris. 
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces -- two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up. 
So what we're saying, essentially, is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system. 
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way. 
Iceland went through this financial crisis. 
And that's the point when you start loving yourself. 
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. 
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. 
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank. 
Well, I examined her carefully. 
This is a brand new song. 
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society. 
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,' said Marder. 
Now, how do you do this? 
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things. 
Normally it's at the back. 
So that's what we call the misguided missile. 
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and this is happening right now. 
So we can now, in a matter of hours, determine a whole human genome. 
We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I've called here the "Actor." 
It's like hurry, build your instruments. 
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider. 
What I find amazing is that Africa is transcending its geography problem. 
Thank you. (Applause) I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. 
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor. 
Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry. 
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line. 
This is a mountain goat. 
And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. 
When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. 
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape? 
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it. 
You need also state ownership, especially of land assets, in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. 
It's this technique of building the properties into the form. 
And we've got to end up with a smaller government. 
So you can see that it's pretty limited, and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code, they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there, but it's not so clear what that something is, and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning, that with the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image? It was a baby's face. 
And the yellow line is the number of injuries, which has remained essentially flat. 
We're screaming along. 
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. 
She's 35 years old in this shot, but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s. 
TBP: No, let me tell you, I've told you what my age was. 
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture. 
When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you, a little bit less so. 
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability. 
So what I can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if I choose that way. 
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories, stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life, which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. 
There was a big competition for the design of this bridge, and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team -- in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect -- perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster -- working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro, and an engineering firm, Ove Arup. 
Many people became fat-phobic. 
And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right. 
So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope, Kepler, has been able to tell us in the last few weeks, and, lo and behold, we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. 
Put your money where you mouth is." 
And it raises an existential question, which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness, why am I not visible in the photograph, and where is this time and place? 
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. 
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. 
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way, that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women. 
And they're doing what they think is best. 
Another quick example about sensing: it's not about people, but about things we use and consume. 
So, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. 
But consider for a moment that sound does have form. 
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. 
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty connected over into Europe. 
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation, and I'll talk about that later. 
He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun, and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!' And the punk tried to run. 
I did it myself. 
And so cricket started becoming big; cricket started bringing riches in. 
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda. 
But so many over the years were helped. 
By now, the United Nations is totally on our side. 
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more, or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. 
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London. 
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day. 
And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting. 
Can that be right? 
PM: So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor, on the brand-new carpet. 
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall, and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students, and I'd like to try to preach it to you. 
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. 
What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. 
(Laughter) This is a part of that. 
It's a story passed on generation after generation. 
And there's a verification taking place. 
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals. 
But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate. 
So there's no stigma. 
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins. 
It's about proving who you are and what you can do. 
Now, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States, it turns out that four percent of the automobiles, the power in four percent of the automobiles, equals that of the electric grid of the US. 
So this is the first sort of step into using that insight into what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool, and trying to gain new insights into mental illness. 
The lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any Melaleuca bark, because it’s totally forbidden. 
Now the question is: How could we ask them? 
So think about, this is in your brain. 
But they want experience in creating an organization. 
To be strong means not to be a girl. 
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did. 
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque, and we can't see what's going on. 
For example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe, it's a network to hook its customers together. 
And there is no way of your being not limitless too. 
Difficult, eh? It's meaningless. 
We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. 
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his, that we try to resolve the contradiction. 
Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. 
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. 
It's like saying, "If you toss a coin and get a head the first time, that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time." 
And it goes like this. 
While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. 
He came out with a wonderful book recently called "Storms of My Grandchildren." 
So, why doesn't it do it? 
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day, standing fully upright in cowboy boots. 
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual. 
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit, we can increase the health and longevity of people. 
So the question becomes, What drives men's support for women's rights? 
And then more general versions of word processors came about. 
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue. 
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense? 
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged. 
But here's the thing: When you get proof, you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that. 
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua. 
Then at a certain moment, the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed. 
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him, had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph. 
And there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya. 
And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression: you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely. 
So after Sally Clark was convicted -- you can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press -- one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was, "The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million." 
The air in this room is very smooth. 
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram, and 10 to the third power is around 1,000. 
Now during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and I tried to study the environment by reading books. 
And this holds for germs, ideas, product adoption, behaviors, and the like. 
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof. 
And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. 
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid, but I didn't think I'd be involved in this. 
(Laughter) 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher. 
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this. 
And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. 
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region. 
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy. 
And this isn't a think, it's a feel. 
We would lose all of our market." 
For example, a friend of mine. 
And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history. 
And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?" 
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions, and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions. 
And people are embracing this. 
It was a precursor to India, a messenger from Gondwana -- a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years. 
Now what are the implications of that? 
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down. 
Don't overdo it." 
We're trying to end mass incarceration." 
In all cases, the life support was removed, and the infants had died.

And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous. 
So even plus odd gives you odd. 
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech. 
It's one of the great products of the human mind. 
This is mental illness.

135 million-plus people. Think about that. 
Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores. 
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. 
AK: Other emotional stuff. 
Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology, and modifying and altering and adjusting these things, we're talking about changing ourselves. 
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with. 
WISER sets out to document, link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement, and fastest-growing movement in human history: humanity's collective immune response to today's threats.

And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data. 
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. 
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer. 
Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks, escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas. 
By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us, and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today. 
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. 
There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic, with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road, and he was driving one of these trucks. 
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone. 
This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA: 750 million, which is a little over 10 percent of the world's population, has helped us digitize human knowledge. 
The older face is quite pleased with the decision. 
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution. 
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks, and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks, not just in the individuals within them. 
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree. 
So, what I want to tell you, very briefly, is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is, or at least we believe, that there is a supermassive black hole there. 
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars. 
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human, that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin, it will live longer. 
And, very happily, there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. 
The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing. 
But I decided then to just give it a try. 
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well. 
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. 
CA: Just kidding. 
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly. 
They’re going to save your grade, and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money, then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade." 
I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal." 
And so three months later, just before she returned to the United States, nurses in Accra go on strike. 
Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans, and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans. 
It's done very well. I love this puzzle. 
Where is learning to talk? 
As much energy as I put into them while making them, they never danced. 
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie." 
And it's that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things, but also the dark and difficult things. 
Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo. 
HA: Thank you. 
Hospital sound is getting worse all the time. 
And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. 
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. 
Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation. 
I am your remaining memory. 
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome. 
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. 
(Applause) Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. 
We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum, so it's all one continuous change in the massing, but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms. 
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it. 
This battery needs to be made out of earth-abundant elements. 
And because working in a store was so hard, I liked going to school; it was like heaven. 
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. 
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. 
I have become myself known. 
That's to prevent pirates from attacking it. 
This, for example, is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. 
He doesn't have that community anymore. 
Let me just pause this for a second if I can. 
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay. 
If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago, I would be as isolated as a hermit. 
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it. 
We need to take advantage of that. 
We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games. 
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair? 
Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. 
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer. 
France scores. Italy scores. 
And that same year, 10 years ago, I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. 
This is a guy called Juanderson. 
This process does no harm, and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. 
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. 
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get? 
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7, but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks, or as we call them, factors. 
And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective. 
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life, our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I feel curiosity, and I feel wonder, but at times I have also felt despair. 
In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak, and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. 
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration. 
It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa at the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho, which is a tiny country, surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa. 
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar; there's a relationship. 
Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. 
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding, but what they do is, they take a light bulb and they smash it. 
How the heck could they be [a] developing country? 
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance, are not synonymous, that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. 
There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. 
They literally flipped the switch. 
The meat is torn up. 
(Applause) So, people of the TED community, I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. 
You have build something very fascinating, and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it. 
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them more, they won't understand anyway." 
So time, space, aesthetics, and then, most important, behavior. 
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears, we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them. 
Well folks, we have a protein problem. 
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies It's been part of the Pension Protection Act. 
And what you're looking at here And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings," sounds ominous, it is. 
You might ask, why is a system like this so important? 
(Laughter) Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design. 
We looked at the threats to these places. 
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff, which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. 
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple? 
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face, and she had a palsy, she was shaking, and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said that she had never heard classical music before, she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine, and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years, when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication. 
Well, what's that got to do with this? 
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?" 
You leave this, the sanctity of your house, and you could be hit on the street. 
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle. 
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous. 
From 1993 through 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft, 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. 
We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. 
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on. 
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because, if you start with a talking shark, readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. 
But that was the end of the bad news, because when Derek came home from the hospital, his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you, Derek, really for the rest of your childhood. 
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal. 
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. 
Technology has a role to play. 
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that." 
Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution, I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries, from the Czech Republic to Sudan. 
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape. 
But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. 
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law. 
This is, it seems a bit dull you know. 
Pictures like this, people perched on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city. 
And the choice of the action, of course, hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him, he wanted to help. 
Competition means, not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500, but within each of these units, there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. 
As some of you might know, babyies are born pretty much legally blind. 
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917, Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity. 
We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. 
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. 
Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow, instead of with 200 punctures, with just a single puncture under local anesthesia. 
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you. 
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened. 
We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today. 
So this is one of Derek's heroes. 
Yeah. 
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know, leaving out the -- what the hell. 
But this is really just the beginning. 
It's very different than most other cultures. All right? 
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there, but our little motor's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes. 
(Applause) So if you've been following the news, you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States, all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years. 
In 1995, illegal drugs were a $400 billion business, representing eight percent of world trade, roughly the same as gas and oil. 
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy. 
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies. 
And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue. 
It has an air channel. It has a blood channel. 
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did." 
Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. 
Their women. 
You should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that this demographic, young men and women in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan." 
So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. 
Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? 
But that's obviously not enough. 
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written, or was writing at the time, didn't sound all that great in some of those halls. 
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. 
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly. 
I know it. I'm seeing it. 
So, another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI. 
It evokes the container metaphor of communication, in which we conceive of ideas as objects, sentences as containers, and communication as a kind of sending. 
I actually want them to create those experiences. 
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season. 
But anger is like gasoline, and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, you've got an inferno. 
(Laughter) "So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there." 
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you? 
And for that reason, polio eradication: it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. 
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport, which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away. 
And radio waves are limited. 
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns. 
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried. 
Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do these things. 
In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. 
And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them, because we're not measuring them dynamically. 
I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid, and because I did, I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. 
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that. 
And he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
So what you're basically seeing here If you go to my site, there's tons of things. 
They're going to get to land. 
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model. 
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new." 
It was a very comfortable game in Mexico City. Have a look. 
(Laughter) And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap." 
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough. 
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame, and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they're doing. 
Is it going to be another Somalia? 
So this brings me to lesson number one: life can do a lot with very little. 
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes, you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this. 
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization, and that is customization. 
That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly. 
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank. 
And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute, of which it can be consciously aware of about 40. 
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning. 
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path. 
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. 
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines. 
But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles. 
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare. 
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light, it just emits light at particular colors, a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones. 
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. 
Now that can be daunting. 
Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares, and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward. 
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object. 
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — (Laughter) — but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said, "Yes, I will." 
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around. 
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. 
My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate, and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. 
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. 
Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential, and our own passion. 
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush. 
They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments. 
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that I seized, because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form. 
Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything like me, it won't. 
My TED wish: there's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. 
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. 
If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that, I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting, not because it's what I'm supposed to do. 
I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it. 
We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry. 
I'm hoping we can, for example, use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly, and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. 
You know we all want to be someone who has watched "Rashomon," but right now we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time. 
I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant. 
It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system. 
It's almost more important than their eyesight. 
Secondly, different types of pivots. 
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. 
So I interrupted him. I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" 
You sit there, OK. 
And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids. 
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties." 
And ugly face is this -- when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!" 
And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview, I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. 
And the next thing is paralysis. 
(Applause) I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland, and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. 
So I had all these notions. This was back in the late '90s, and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy, but a lot of people then went on and actually did it. 
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth? 
(Laughter) We all look the same inside, believe me. 
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing? 
I was also asked to leave the organization, a cartoonists' organization in America, that for me was my lifeline. 
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that. 
You don't get a chance to mess it up. 
That's actually the actual printer right now, and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. 
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory, and I stripped the labels off. 
There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there. 
One of the most popular websites in the world, run by the most powerful company in the world, and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it. 
I hope someone does something to help them." 
Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society? 
I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house. 
Do you actually want it online? 
I've brought with me, from Southern California, the FM device. 
This is us chasing it in the submersible. 
And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend. 
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. 
And I started to bring some order into some flags. 
(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon, two hunters stalk their prey. 
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there, it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism, which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales. 
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something. 
RD: Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this. 
And that led me to this project. 
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve, is only 94 hectares, and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy, 20 times more than fishing, and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue. 
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk. 
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA -- put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine, polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code, and it was all over by 1966. 
This is not unusual, and it’s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes, because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. 
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways? 
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference. 
In fact, I'd go so far as to say, if you don't already have a nerd in your life, you should get one. 
We're going to speak now to the Operations Center. 
And as we go from naught to 0.1 second, it becomes more ticklish. 
And fears and storytelling have the same components. 
"Sit," sniff butt. 
So I thought that it will be good to start with it. 
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible. 
So that's it's official scientific name, in reference to its deep-dwelling habits. 
But because it's flexible, it can be on any surface whatsoever. 
He sat next to me on the New York City subway, and he started chatting me up. 
They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues. 
It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. 
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them. 
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. 
At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. 
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater. 
But there are other barriers. 
Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. 
Well, the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. 
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. 
I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands. 
So I was led to write this song just for her, just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. 
(Applause) Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret. 
Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries. 
I had that condition, to a certain extent, from my own childhood illness. 
And this is the great team that helped us make it happen. 
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God, but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. 
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community. 
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. 
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet, in a less linear form. 
The cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment. 
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. 
(Applause) Wait. Wait. 
In a way, you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. 
Getting a little more technical now. 
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. 
Look at Solyndra, or whatever it was. 
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this, what we found is that 46 percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. 
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. 
No novels. 
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. 
But they did look at these three and they said, "These are three different dinosaurs, and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them. 
You can sort of have it all with these things. 
All right, why would we see this correlation? 
What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs, understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. 
My breath is down to three breaths a minute. 
So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. 
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this. 
Warning: that may not work. 
Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims. 
Amateurs can do it also. 
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game. 
We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. 
That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean. 
But it is strange. 
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort, and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them. 
A couple things happened. 
Now, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral, these must be sea lanes of communication, or these might be fiber optic cables." 
And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom. 
We use these every day. 
We know more about mobile operating systems, but what we really need is a moral operating system. 
The way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46 to 47 or 48. 
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport. 
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa. 
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us, and many of them we cannot reverse. 
Sometimes, I found small jobs in exchange for food. 
We still can't get rid of scars. 
So what about us? What about our generation, and our media revolution, the Internet? 
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. 
Because liberals like to say, "Fetch, please." 
They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures, and they were also inviting us into dolphin games. 
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt. 
In fact, it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth. 
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. 
The baby was delivered through a C-section, but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia, a loss of oxygen to the brain. 
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton, and those PCBs, being fat-soluble, accumulate in these dolphins. 
More so, I became very interested, as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions, I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how, indeed, it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women. 
But, of equal importance, as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars, we transmit that journey, the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth, we transmit those images back to Earth. 
But as that space shuttle returns to Earth, and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field, they begin to see the effects of gravity. 
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum, because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week." 
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young. 
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging. 
The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. 
And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with: There was glue on the spine of the book. 
The full score is 72 feet wide. 
I don’t remember how we got there. 
What was the feedback like? 
Let us celebrate diversity. 
We have to change. 
And through the children is usually the way to go. 
They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter) Crazy, crazy. 
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder. 
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food. 
Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head, because it would do that to it. 
What kind of an experience do they have? 
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement? And the most obvious one is to look at the sky, and so we thought, now what could they be looking at in the sky? 
What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun? 
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony. 
But I can give you a few examples. 
So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row. 
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world, causing massive famines and economic decline. 
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years. 
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion." 
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously, to use abstractions, and to link them logically. 
They believe McDonald's food is tastier, and it leads them to experience it as tastier. 
BF: Good. 
They give you 48 hours to finish this race. 
Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action, into movement. 
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. 
And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. 
He said to me, "I would be free." 
So let me just start with my story. 
It's probably driven our culture for millennia. 
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright. 
You see the person live. 
There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. 
What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. 
And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction. 
(Laughter) This was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible. 
My wife replied, "None of your business." 
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk. 
The DRC is a dangerous place. 
They fail to reach the people they most need to serve. 
So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time. 
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. 
I keep trying to make it work. 
Electricity for cities, at its best, is what's called baseload electricity. 
(Applause) I'm going to start with a little story. 
Nowhere else in the world has community-adopted conservation at this scale. 
But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind, because it's about the environment. 
Compassion is going to be limited. 
So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills, that magic that you need to engage an audience, to engage a student? 
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment. 
So there's these two dinosaurs, T. Rex and Nanotyrannus. 
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy, but as a place that can't resolve its own fights, and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous, the higher interest rates are going to be, the quicker we're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity. 
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture. 
And if it grows very big it probably happens. 
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project? 
You know. I need to say something. 
It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours, have the maps disseminated out to the major universities. 
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall. 
What is the point?" 
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure, here's the same story, the same progression, told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago, in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. 
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans, and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces, and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. 
Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. 
When I imagine my life, what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had, it makes me wonder. 
They had a "Let's build a global network" club, and it worked out very well. 
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago. 
The Prussian peasantry said, "We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. 
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar, and they loved it. 
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?" 
But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people. 
It took 10 years to build. 
In the spinal ward, that's normal. 
People were so empowered. 
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. 
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven. 
A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. 
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. 
Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school. 
It's a 130-fold improvement, and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. 
So thank you all and I love them. 
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house." 
It tells you if you have H5N1. 
(Laughter) But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar, because he is actually the Chinese character for "people." 
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat." 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too. 
So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter, able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. 
What are the kind of jobs that we have today? 
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time. 
Thank you. 
And I've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right. 
Here we are, in a space, the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body. 
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public, it had 100,000 people registered. 
My head snapped back over my red seat. 
(Laughter) Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter) I think there's more memory in my watch. 
But it isn't just about growing, because we all are part of this jigsaw. 
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are. 
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. 
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real. 
And this stuff rippled like wildfire. 
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit. 
The Sun burns our peripheral vision. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And I did. So, he kept me in line. 
Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it. 
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play." 
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world. 
This is an aerial photo taken last summer. 
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver. 
So the idea of a mistake: From the perspective of a jazz musician, it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake. 
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life, chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until, you know, I can't record them anymore. 
People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?" 
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?) Girl: No. 
And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker. 
It's their great calling right now, to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations, appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. 
Over the last few years, I haven't had that much time to really think. 
He is here, and you're not going to take him. 
That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists. 
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us. 
So for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. 
Secondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth. 
That means it doesn't mix with the water. 
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be, "Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour. 
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass. 
And this was fascinating. 
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children? 
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. 
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on. 
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful, as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas, in these different places of the world. 
And Jeff came up beside me and said, "So, have you ever been cow tipping?" 
Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars. 
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. 
It is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel-driven generators, air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer. 
So, as she mentioned, that is overstated for sure, but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating. 
But the most surprising part was when we turned to, what are we going to work on in the week ahead? 
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. 
And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline? 
(Laughter) That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. 
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. 
And each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus. 
I mean this went through thick and thin, through war and peace, through boom times and recessions. 
So, since the transistor is so simple, you can put lots of them together. 
And this is a very mesh-y thing. 
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. 
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse. 
It's not geography. 
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand. 
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp. 
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute." 
Add some more. 
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else." 
So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. 
I'd like to say I don't know. 
We care what happens in "Apocalypse Now." 
Now, in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars: half of it to retool the car, truck and plane industries; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry. 
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. 
They put it on fire. It was boiling hot, getting ready to give to the kids. 
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why." 
Well, the night is young, but the book has been out for half a year, and nothing terrible has happened. 
And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull, and flip the market. 
And we got the same remarkable results. 
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain. 
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light. 
How does that happen? How do you make something flow through something? 
If they then mixed with each other there, then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside Africa carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world. 
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal. 
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. 
Please stop!" 
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning. 
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them. 
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me. 
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. 
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. 
Thirty-six years ago at nearly this moment, a 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question, but the nurse was already there with an answer. 
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer, this is the transistor. 
There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003: a dip when our sales, over a three-year period, were down 17 percent. 
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region, the Middle East and North Africa region. 
But certainly in people older than my wife, this appears to be a more marked effect. 
Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim. 
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... 
I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. 
They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City. 
Well folks, I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it. 
I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. 
In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own. 
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. 
And my team just gave it to me straight. 
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored. 
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it. 
You're live. 
It was hard, it was a difficult road, but ultimately the leaders of the community came together, realizing we only have each other. 
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that, but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here. 
Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist. 
I wasn't doing something bad. 
Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. 
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality, you could only build on it. 
And there's this Flaubert quote that I love: "I have always tried to live in an ivory tower, but a tide of shit is beating at its walls, threatening to undermine it." 
What is that? 
Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs. 
I was frightened. We were frightened. 
But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel, and that corresponds to a single ion channel. 
Now the Journal of the National Medical Association gave my memoir a full clinical review, which is very unusual. 
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately. 
So, I asked the translator why she thought she was dying. 
In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about? 
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. 
Who thinks that A is true -- that, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail? 
Do you want to keep it all, or do you want to send some amount back? 
We reached a tipping point this year where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political and competitive thing they could do. 
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. 
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box. 
I mean, one is, fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter) You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff. 
(Laughter) Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. 
And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. 
So, they answered my emails. 
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it. 
No, I don't think it is. 
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago, we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution, and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground, with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production, will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down, and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation. 
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum. 
We try to can it and package it and make it "better" and sell it to people. 
And with these keys, they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems, to see and hear everything, and maybe even infect some of them. 
And what is the natural enemy, the biologically controlled agent, or the good bug, that we are talking about? 
How do we study that? 
Women are objects, especially sexual objects. 
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn. 
It was very -- actually, it was a very good study, and got me a job in an ad agency. 
And that's pretty much why I do it. 
Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime. 
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us. 
We've had others. 
The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. 
Ah-hah. 
Now recently, there's been development in this field. 
That is another story. 
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school, and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. 
Now my mother was different. 
But they are. 
Forensic scientists said, "The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million." 
But then I started thinking, is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity? 
But that is also true of any white area. 
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it was one word: electronics. 
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged. 
So since then I've been the bridge, and a lot of people have walked over me. 
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west. 
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves. 
(Applause) So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like, "Shhh! 
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. 
I think this is the neatest-looking thing. 
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations, unless we are able to make civil society and people, not part of the problem, but part of the solution? 
OK, so let me not forget my punchline. 
I don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. 
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. 
And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement. 
It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. 
So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain, and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down. 
It's really only a successful escape. 
This structure, then, can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself, so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself, and that's shown in green here on this micrograph. 
It fell in every hospital it went into. 
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart. 
I have learned a lot from people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi. 
But the one story stuff ... 
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone. 
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. 
And that's really where interaction lies, and that's the importance of interaction. 
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. 
While you're waiting around for your nuclear, you have to run the regular electric power grid, which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. 
And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. 
How does Vermeer know her? 
Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies. 
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here. 
JA: During the recent tour by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U.S. and Europe, we saw how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls, how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage to receive the jackets from our musicians, how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long, seemed to last forever, and how the public, after the concert was over, went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph. 
That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt. 
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival. 
So I'd like to show you a few examples, because there are many possible applications for this new interface. 
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger." 
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means, with my work -- than making toilets, so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory, saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end. 
And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. 
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around, and it actually sleeps four people. 
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas. 
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family." 
But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition, either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly, and it may be evolution in real time. 
It's wavy. 
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land. 
They make use of exactly the same winds. 
But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. 
Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell institute. 
You can run for the Senate out of a different state, but it's hard to do that as a mayor. 
So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work, I think, in many areas of human problem solving, particularly those which involve human psychology, which is: The tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible, as much compulsion as possible, whereas actually, the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied. 
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business, but, in fact, it's negative. 
This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio. 
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA. 
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. 
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow, and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot? 
Here they even got the help of the firemen.

The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work, two researchers who were at Harvard, and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology, which are remarkably beautiful studies, but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. 
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.

They have vocabulary for sense of purpose, ikigai, like the Okinawans. 
But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement, all sides have reached out to each other. 
All the computers now are copies of that machine. 
And I had to visualize the swim. 
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great. 
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion, and I'll tell you a little bit about that. 
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. 
And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. 
I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods, Pads, and bling, which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death. 
Who studied some physics in university? 
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland, and it's all related to the oil. 
Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights, we do say that human rights are universal. 
And there's some basic innumeracy going on. 
The Eames' film Tops, lower left. 
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark. 
This is very, very important because this is the system, this is the crucible, out of which life on the planet came, and it's now time for us to understand it. 
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago, so you're the first ones to be seeing these, these new factory pictures I've taken. 
What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb. 
This makes an igloo. 
And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches, and then to be -- and rock the boat. 
It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century. 
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones. 
Video: Hello! 
Hello. Who's there, please? 
It carves up the history of life, and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end, right before the bolide impact. 
Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus, the voices fetuses hear, starting around the fourth month of gestation, are muted and muffled. 
So, we've got now this flour. 
He said -- think about this one. 
We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat. 
(Laughter) And he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you? 
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines -- all kinds of things. 
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some, and they offered it to me. 
During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. 
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. 
I mean, all of the improvements he made -- and it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt, today is named after him. 
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. 
You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue, but you don't really want to get all the other insects. 
And why is that? 
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things. 
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital, and pushed the boundaries. 
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. 
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life," where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. 
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower, they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate. 
The first is a Kinect camera, which will be out in November, some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults, collecting dust in Microsoft, plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead, mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea: to create a real, living being in a computer. 
It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel, met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute. 
And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change. 
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. 
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration. 
Let me connect the dots. 
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. 
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used. 
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code, it's wrapped around these purple proteins -- or I've labeled them purple here. 
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons. 
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. 
I launched a big program [unclear] CSIR about nine years ago. 
People died; so be it. 
What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas? 
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition -- God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature, does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do." 
I rarely actually quote anything, so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can, [in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006. 
So we thought, okay, we're going to try to get out and get some slime. 
Here are some examples of Entropica in action. 
And anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way. 
And I said, "I'm learning." 
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio. 
The early '70s, I was in college. 
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington. 
This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits. 
And they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier." 
they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." 
In fact, the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed. 
So we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes, how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation. 
This is the dream of the African girl. 
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. 
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert. 
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold." 
You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time. 
So I yelled, "Who the hell's out there? What's going on?" 
He was leaning on his other arm. 
Maybe fear. 
New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning. 
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it, and as I sat there, I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment than these people. 
"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists, and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms. 
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools. 
I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials, but can we do similar things? 
There she is. 
They need political solutions. 
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe. 
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. 
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it. 
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. 
I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner, and I've spent my career working in other contested cities, like Chicago, my hometown; Harlem, which is my current home; Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey. 
So, when we think about the future of energy, imagine what would it be like if instead of this, we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently. 
So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. 
You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago, "Give me my damn data, because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean." 
But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions. 
We lose something dear, something everyone in this room loves and cherishes, if we lose this republic, and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong. 
A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services. 
You're looking at her open lung biopsy. 
Underneath this, like the story of the swan, is a million things very difficult to do. 
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so. 
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally, its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow, so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic. 
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch. 
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. 
So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. 
We need to invest in real solutions: incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation, gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets. 
I appreciate your time. 
She does that through important visual forms of photography and film. 
And this applies for everything. Even in sales. 
And if you lose where you are in your biosphere, or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere, I would say to you, take a deep breath. 
It's better than those that don't play. 
Well, fortunately since 2001, we've got new treatments, new tests, and we're far more successful, but we don't have any more nurses. 
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. 
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even. 
Thank you, and godspeed. 
I mean we're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into fast-forward. 
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks -- I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain. 
What can damage accumulate in? 
So help us go from this to this. 
And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group. 
We don't know anyone. 
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965. 
Some, I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. 
Of course someday, in the deep future, a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented, rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. 
(Laughter) So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. 
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. 
It's active. You can't tell the difference really. 
(Applause) Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi. 
People don't know that they have lived through worse, that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck, that problems of the mind are greater still, more injurious, than a hundred broken necks. 
A person behind Japan, what do we get? 
But you know what, these little nerves are so small, in the context of prostate cancer, that they are actually never seen. 
But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple, in the sense that it is completely reliable. 
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese, and his flock continues. 
And the family was united. 
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. 
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two, and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five. 
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there. 
Say this person approaching here, and they say, "Well is this a suicide bomber or not? 
We'll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea. 
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the United States, and a handful of other developed countries, have shouldered the entire burden of research and development. 
(Applause) I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. 
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity. 
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic, and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras. 
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man. 
The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously. 
Anyone want to take a stab at the number of times, given how they've introduced this, the number of times police in Queensland used O.C. spray in that period? 
This is an area I intend to take on this year. 
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. 
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. 
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition. 
This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. 
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats, and bats are in trouble too. 
Do you want Milo to squash it? 
(Applause) When we use the word "architect" or "designer," what we usually mean is a professional, someone who gets paid, and we tend to assume that it's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big, systemic design challenges that we face like climate change, urbanization and social inequality. 
And I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells, and then I was using knockout mouse models -- mice that couldn't make the gene. 
Go to bed. 
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares. 
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out -- that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past, a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years, if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times since I was born. When you have a new baby, 
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us? 
He's a director of an electroplating company. 
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. 
He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. 
And they want the washing machine. 
Thank you. 
And now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best. 
During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. 
(Applause) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people. 
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book. 
We all have different preferences, different needs. 
Here's the Architecture Machine Group, the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981. 
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up. 
This was one of our first patients, Chris. 
And she's now at AIMS. (Applause) So now let me get to our TED wish. 
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly. 
Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished. 
I will just leave you with two things. 
That would be a huge, vast metropolitan area, probably much larger than the city of Victoria. 
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first. 
There are too many of us outside and everybody, just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention, it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture, looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got. 
Why does that matter? 
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational. 
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. 
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant, she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. 
What we've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus. 
So, we used the same bladder-inflated system, and we took it for testing. 
So: one, two, three, go. 
Alright. Great. 
It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it. 
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand. 
It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives. 
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid. 
It really is going to be a side effect of what we, collectively, make of these kinds of efforts. 
"I feel very lonely." 
This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. 
It is printing. You put that on, you warm it a little bit, the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper, and you end up with the device that you want. 
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you, you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time. 
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? 
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me, and he had little horns come up above his eyes. 
So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. 
Wernher von Braun, in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote: "science and religion are not antagonists. 
"Fix the chicken." 
So then, you move off to this larger sphere of "human +," and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being. 
They got instant democracy in the 1990s: elections without checks and balances. 
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation, and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture, which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work. 
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website, but also grow myself?" 
In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. 
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. 
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. 
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system, which composers have been using for hundreds of years, which proves actually that it does. 
He turned it into an adventure for the kids. 
The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear but see, literally see, what was going on elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to? 
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts. 
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are. 
Does it work? Do I like it? 
The impact was great. 
Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland. 
In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel," he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel, that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere -- that conquered the rest of the world. 
And this turns out to be useful. 
And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting? 
And what does that look like? 
♫ Alors je sens en moi ♫ ♫ Mon coeur qui bat ♫ (Applause) (Music) [Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children. 
Okay, for example, that's Palestine. 
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free. 
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through. 
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects, putting the oil back in our mental engines, There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year, and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you. 
That's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands? 
It's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine. 
They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government. 
And on Earth Day, 1990 -- the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak. 
And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves. 
You've got the disorganized rebels over here. 
Thank you. 
I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am, that nobody else in the world can do this swim. 
My dad has Alzheimer's disease. 
In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. 
So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. 
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power from government to citizens. 
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why. 
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. 
I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer. 
Strike three is menopause. 
We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. 
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks. 
(Laughter) During the next year, I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital. 
Now the other issue comes with, not just the ability to tell pitches apart, but the ability to tell sounds apart. 
(Laughter) So, first, the first term is estimation. 
Well without thinking, I told him "Come tomorrow. 
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then -- but it's still the same theme song -- and introduce you to my lab and current work, which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. 
Mind your language. 
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public. 
Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. 
Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home. 
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. 
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think. 
What are the characteristics we can control for? 
We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there. 
Oh, for the love of God. 
This is a statue from Oxford. 
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor. 
And of course, theoretically, it does, and if you look at older texts, then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud. 
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information? 
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown and war, and as I am talking to you, millions of men, women and children are suffering and dying. 
The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. 
Somebody said that yesterday. 
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else? 
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. 
And so we need both the market and we need aid. 
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage. 
The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us. The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run. 
The chimps are playing better than the humans, better in the sense of adhering to game theory. 
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms." 
In part one, I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. 
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. 
What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity. 
And if we can switch to slides -- all right, here we go. 
And at nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses. 
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa; we're not really talking about African narratives. 
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before, and we see these genes turned on there. 
You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. 
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock, that organisms are busy munching their way through. 
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. 
I mean, I find information just too interesting. 
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize. 
It's really amazing. 
(Laughter) I think Paul Simon is in the audience, and he has -- he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex, "Slip-Slidin' Away." 
We're looking at that yellow box. 
That was their perception. 
And this is where it gets really interesting, because it's not that simple, because we are not simple. 
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top. 
We overlay them. This is actual data. 
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve. 
And for them, autism was devastating. 
And there are features that look tectonic. 
This was when we had our "Aha!" 
So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face? 
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. 
This is a project that had its inception 15 years ago when our team then -- we called the institute TIGR -- was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history. 
Again, studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. 
The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know -- Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. 
You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns, you get these beautiful natural forms. 
Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. 
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness -- possibly for many different types of cancer. 
From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead. 
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so -- plumber, general, plumber, general -- so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one. 
Inside, the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates. 
Because it is no longer true to itself. 
Next, this is by Thomas Swifton. 
The only mistake is if I'm not aware, if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity. 
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here, but what I want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously, and have for the last 4 billion years. 
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed. 
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air. 
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. 
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. 
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. 
People go, one, two, three, four. 
What's happening is we're taking this technology -- it's becoming more precise, more potent -- and we're turning it back upon ourselves. 
At school I was being just taught about physics, and I was told that if there is something that exists, then it is measurable. 
And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own. 
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. 
This is a person going for a walk. 
I think that's one of the main changes, also, in architecture: that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form, like a Latin cross for a church, but actually all the traits of a church: so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source, directionality that focuses you towards an altar. 
And for at least one of them, there is a drug. 
Now what would that look like? 
So now, Mahabuba, she is saving the lives of hundreds, thousands, of women. 
This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil. 
Anyway -- so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world. 
It's titled "The Innocents." 
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness, which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you, so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape, and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement. 
This is from my second book. 
Before I met her, I went through some suboptimal search results. 
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m. 
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. 
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. 
Be easier to find us at night. 
(Laughter) In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away. 
I called that project Women Are Heroes. 
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent. 
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today. 
And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd, I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter) Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your jargon, divide by relevance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience, and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing, and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. 
And a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff that hasn't come back." (Laughter) Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache? 
So what actually happened? 
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design, and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion. 
So what happens here? 
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. 
But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. 
And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards. 
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. 
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. 
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.) What I want to talk about today is one idea. 
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability, but an architecture that is full of tension, an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart, and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. 
This report is our main public report. 
This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful, and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what. 
It's been a blast, hasn't it? 
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it. 
And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. 
They didn't talk. But most of all, they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them, from their environment and from the people. 
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away. 
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. 
And there was a little study about people who don't handshake, and comparing them with ones who do handshake. 
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. 
PM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.") PM: ShaketheDust.org. 
They're unique answers to a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human and alive? 
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No. 
We do expect to see a sea-level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. 
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds. 
Every trip to the store, or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. 
They don't have any conveniences. 
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one, I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now. 
If, one day, and I think it will be within 15 years from now, or 20 years. 
So, how much would this cost? 
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding, because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on. 
So, these two came to lunch, and we got thrown out of the restaurant. 
One is jobs. 
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. 
Unfortunately, it's not the answer. 
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem! 
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level. 
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them. 
What do futures sacrifice for success? 
Today, we know that every cell has a sex. 
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years. 
We can heal the disease. 
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water. 
It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet. 
You see the cards? Yes. 
But it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk." 
You have a huge ring. 
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes. 
I'm talking about your language, of course, because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind, and they can attempt to do the same to you, without either of you having to perform surgery. 
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. 
My company has spent 35 years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine, which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical. 
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell, the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials, until maybe now when it might just matter. 
Because the longer I deal with these problems, the more convinced I am that we have to -- whether it's economics, health, education, whatever -- we have to build systems. 
We need everyone at the table. 
I'm an artist, so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art, science and culture. 
My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these: don't persuade, defend or interrupt. 
Not going to be easy." 
And I found a woman that had -- we found her, she was odd because she had data after she died. 
And finally the building -- this is the model. 
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer. 
Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems. 
These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us, but are important for everybody in this world. 
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable, that can become energy, that can become food, that can become fiber, that can become human beings, that can become a whole series of things, then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. 
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge, and Bragg said, "Build models." 
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. 
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. 
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism. 
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. 
about this question. Do you take the picture or not? 
And everyone's somewhere in the middle. 
We know the obstacles that are in our way right now, in difficult times. 
So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized. 
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour. 
I should tell you some stories about remarkable people, so I thought I'd start with my mother. 
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. 
(Music) This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry. 
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. 
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. 
So then once you do that you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?" 
That's been medicalized as well. 
Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull." 
(Laughter) Okay. So now the Titanic transition. 
And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls millions of people on television. 
Turn to somebody next to you. 
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels. 
I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about checklists. 
Well that's what's actually happened so far. 
This appears in my puzzle calendar. 
Or, "How can we help?" 
Two days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which, I saw a Reuters report that said Madeira had had their first cases of dengue, about 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases. 
And that's going to keep happening. 
But it has the ability to override our feelings. 
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. 
It's sort of like sobering up. 
And it can only use so much memory." 
So if we can get the lights ... 
Her mother was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her. 
And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack -- (Laughter) -- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. 
TBP: Fracking? What is fracking? 
We can't see them directly. 
And as a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores, that I sort of lived my whole life, is process. 
(Music) So you see, he played this note. 
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women. 
This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. 
So my conclusion is very simple. 
Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument? 
I don't think so, because it happens, not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way. 
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know, "Would Signore like the truffles?" 
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells. 
They are so different. 
And they use a completely different methodology that involves -- after the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash, and they call them on the phone, and they asked them what happened. 
I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA. 
And then, the systemic risks. 
Sounds so simple. 
Now if movement is so important, how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement? 
It allows us to make sense of the world around us. 
We don't understand the code used by the brain. 
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. 
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts) Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) What's the point? The point is what science does for us. 
So how are we going to solve this? 
I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever." 
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs. 
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl, and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl. 
David says, "I want to fight Goliath," and Saul tries to give him his armor, because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,' you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,' infantry on infantry." 
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? 
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky, and you just keep the shutter open, as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope, it will see something like this. 
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do. 
Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you, consumed by fire with my love for you. 
And this is what we're designing for. 
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it. 
No formal education, but very knowledgeable. 
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. 
Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge, and I think rather severely. 
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit -- we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat. 
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear, that was the noise. 
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened on 9/7. 
These sequences right up here -- which don't even code for protein, by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these, so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses, without having to make something individual. 
Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited. 
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. 
But not everything was human, and I will give you a very exciting example. 
That's wonderful, but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. 
It's hard to do high-rise. 
And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois, they chose the Igbo version. 
This fish actually has high beams. 
Well how did that happen? 
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. 
Unfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know, or any other kind of business class really, but I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know, bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups, because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people; they're making money off all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least, capitalism has been a constructive force, and more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm of moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic, 
Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle, it doesn't leave the -- doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism. 
You'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur. 
Same with this -- it's a movie review, an art review, a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go. 
When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting. 
The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from "ah" to "ee." 
We count numbers. 
We found spectacular new species, the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked -- from the shoreline to the abyss, form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between. 
So even my stethoscope is now digital. 
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it, we've got to do something about it. 
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. 
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now. 
I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry, their art, their literature, their music, their sport, whatever it might be. 
Is it a utilitarian object? 
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides, nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. 
Lots of sheep. 
One in four, maximum. 
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. 
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created. 
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating. 
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back. 
Those are invisible. 
I watch faces. 
You've got to have skepticism and humility. 
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. 
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?" 
(Laughter) Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. 
What frightens you?" 
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century, but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century. 
When time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth, people are constantly preparing, trying to soak up all the information they possibly can, taking risks, exploring. 
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf, and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents, Take that same good, and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer, in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere, you get 50 cents, maybe a buck per cup of coffee. 
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. 
And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions. 
And employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work, didn't have the right attitudes and experience. 
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. 
They have a magazine that they call G2. 
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.

I used the word postmodern as if it were OK. 
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that. 
This was the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart. 
I was in Shanghai, in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago -- one of the 2,500 skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years. 
Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year. 
They're taking data, the test scores, and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase." 
(Applause) The Kraken, a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales, and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island. 
And take bipedality. 
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing. 
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. 
As it happens, he was writing about what had become French. 
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. 
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician. 
We're here, none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us, not because we checked, but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. 
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice. 
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. 
It's a long story, believe me. 
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites. 
(Laughter) (Applause) MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion is the following question: Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation, the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey, which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes? 
And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy: divination through the earth. 
So cancer could be thought of as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end.

Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information. 
And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy. 
And this is what he did, he goes, he says, "Take your time." 
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that. 
They're our natural garbage collectors. 
And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too. 
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas. 
But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. 
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt, similar to the one that I'm wearing now. 
How about this: What if in any situation you could just calculate, look at the choices, measure out which one's better and know what to do? 
So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box. 
They'll be able to focus their hearing, they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity, do a series of things that we can't do. 
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right? 
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service. 
If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day, that might not be so big a claim. 
And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this." 
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner? 
We have to fix our media. 
So we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007. 
It's always what it was and what it can be. 
So control is no longer a zero-sum game. 
1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. 
Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '70s. 
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. 
And I was thinking about this, of all places, on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago, because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary. 
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions. 
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life, only virtually. 
It's more like, say, if you were a dog. 
And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. 
And they kill lions. 
So here, all of a sudden, we're looking at a map of the human heart. 
When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was. 
And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture. 
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility. 
Thank you very much. 
This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera. 
And why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum? 
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?" 
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee. 
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. 
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage, so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians. 
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one -- a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. 
Let me give you another example. 
Now, the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished, all within about 150 years. 
So now that you're all experts on protocells, we're going to play a game with these protocells. 
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. 
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City. 
I said, "Listen, it's insane. 
(Laughter) They tend to eat a plant-based diet. 
(Applause) If you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this. 
At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian. 
Or, when you're designing a piece, make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round, or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical. 
Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months, and people sometimes say to me, "Well Tim, it's kind of obvious. 
The other partners that we have got is business communities. 
My grandmother had depression. 
It's the combination of strength, extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special, and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists, so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. 
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit -- but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23andMe, and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody, a living person with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma. 
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished. 
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby? 
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion. 
And I'm just going to read one of them to you. 
I'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time. 
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great. 
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. 
Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries, in many cultures. 
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else. 
The west coast calls became more and more popular, until by 1998, none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone. 
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history. 
Add 64, we get 104. 
These clipboards are filled with numbers. 
Now in our case, although it wasn't necessary, we could also actually map the network of the students. 
But out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape. 
Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community might embrace this idea, Minister." 
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. 
So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible. 
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background, after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his hook and he had his -- he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that, quote -- his quote -- it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years. 
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. 
(Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. 
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler. 
And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. 
And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. 
And the same thing is happening in eyes. 
You can use the lighter to start the fire. 
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics? 
And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are, we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff, both in economic terms and in energy terms. 
In fact, cars, who needs them? 
So, many years after that in 1998, I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying, "We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here. 
The idea is embryonic. 
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. 
Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget. 
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. 
We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions. 
But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there, and we talked about fractals. 
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we're going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in. 
And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS, email and web, and put a map so that you could see what was happening where, and you could visualize that data. 
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well. 
The way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover. 
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285, the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now -- there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all. 
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. 
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello." 
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want. 
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know, just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. 
(Laughter) I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know. 
SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. 
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. 
So this is the lab at the high school, and the principal there is in love with this room. 
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it. 
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. 
That's as ambitious as we are. 
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet. 
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid, I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like, see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down. 
But it's also a huge social problem. 
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. 
First of all, Muslims -- pious, conservative, believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion -- should not cling onto everything in their culture, thinking that that's divinely mandated. 
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months. 
And we did an operation, and my company did a dawn attack -- you know, the classic dawn attack: you prepare all night, move to the line of departure. 
And to make his prayer book he used parchment. 
That didn't go over really well. 
Which they decided not to. 
So I followed my hunches. 
Of course, we can't forget Africa. 
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. 
(Whistling) Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do. 
It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful, and that it’s a permissive environment. 
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world. 
They can get basic utilities like electricity. 
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word. 
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. 
So, what did you do, last time you got serious? 
The third trait is metis, what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word. 
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. 
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. 
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point. 
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle. 
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder. 
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance." 
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain, we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest, making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork. 
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note." 
For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. 
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. 
I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends. 
We need to put money where it can productively grow. 
Because I can't explain otherwise, when I look at the figures, what's going on. 
We had deflation during the Depression, but that was collapse of the money supply, collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena. 
Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing. 
You would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop, but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street: there's actual diversity in the plants. 
Each cubicle is dark and dingy, identified with a painted number on the wall, and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. 
So we say the universe is expanding. 
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues. 
Let me just give you one final example of what that means. 
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary. 
And this is a timely issue. 
Another example is "slash." 
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence. 
Now is this a new idea? 
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them. 
And at this point, by this summer, everybody -- scientists, sports scientists, endurance experts, neurologists, my own team, Bonnie -- said it's impossible. 
What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? 
But I think last year when governments did step in, people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act. 
And I started collecting sheep. 
(Laughter) But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- (Laughter) -- sorry. 
They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. 
Take Nigeria again: double B-minus -- in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison. 
(Laughter) While, somewhat, the Spaniards ... 
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated. 
And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. 
My students promised me it would work. 
This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old. 
Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. 
So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come, we will further radicalization, I believe. 
They're searching for bush meat; forest animals they can kill to feed their families. 
They're clicking on things and staring at screens." 
This is about food and water, soil and climate, the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives. 
Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. 
Chef: No, but that's all it is. 
What an achievement that is. 
Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that since I was the leader of the group, I told my colleagues that if they come, we will arrest them. 
Curiosity and passion. 
We all have children. 
And since they're used so often, a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate. 
You can start to see words emerging here. 
Amazon, now with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books. 
When this happened, a part of me thought, well, what's the big deal? 
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it. 
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells. 
But are conservatives happy about this? 
This is the vision we have, isn't it. 
It's always about my taste. 
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. 
I was me, but I was now me despite a limp, and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me. 
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. 
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building, I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it, because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic? 
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future, you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head. 
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m. 
The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement. 
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately, as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people, he struggled to find a new one during the recession. 
Here is a way we can get people to critical care. 
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps. 
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space, the quantified boundaries, as suggested by this analysis. 
Occasionally, kids would come and join me and watch, but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. 
So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another. 
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing. 
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here. 
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. 
Now ideas have this amazing property. 
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right? 
We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers. 
So here's another asteroid. 
The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful." 
(Applause) Chris has been so nice. 
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. 
We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes. 
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out -- we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year. 
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. 
Well, the short answer is, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II, including those that made fortune cookies, so that's the time when the Chinese moved in, kind of saw a market opportunity and took over. 
And we can walk through the reasons for that, but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from, whereas the larger, faster-growing cell takes only two days. 
That is until last year, when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur, the coveted French gastronomic prize. 
But maybe it was time to prove to myself, yes, it's important to understand the past, it is important to look at it in a different light, but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present. 
SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss? 
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht. 
Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or, one day, their contact lenses, and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. 
I mean, this is all very depressing, right -- people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on. 
But hold on. This map is 700 years old. 
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?" 
This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years to form in its complexity that we see right now. 
It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. 
It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season. 
In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts, with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime, people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases, for publishing or giving away official information. 
The first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today, both because of the inputs, which are becoming massive, and because of the plasticity of the organ, is the brain. 
We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996. 
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. 
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. 
Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark, through a process we now call chemosynthesis. 
Now after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit. 
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. 
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years, we could bring that incidence down to half. 
And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said. 
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines? 
He always made me feel smart. 
Funny, that. 
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization? 
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. 
So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born? 
As a musician, I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant, I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken, because I know that music would never sound the same to me. 
(Laughter) "And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head." 
I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist. 
It had by no means got the green light yet. 
And within just a couple years, San Francisco became the first no-kill city, running no deficit, completely supported by the community. 
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government. 
It's happening all over the world. 
So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes. 
When it comes to choice, we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives. 
And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream. 
We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. 
"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time. 
It's written in the Declaration of Independence. 
The city can be built. 
But I was still working with sculpture, and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter. 
We had nine cameras going. 
Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom. 
But now we have these amazing, futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape, paints that conduct electricity, pigments that change color, fabrics that light up. 
When we looked at their PSA levels -- which is a marker for prostate cancer -- they got worse in the control group, but they actually got better in the experimental group, and these differences were highly significant. 
And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record. 
And how do you make it simple? 
Okay, now follow me on this, because I'm taking a big risk here. 
(Laughter) Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. 
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff. 
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention. 
It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran. 
Do you see the subject? 
We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference, like myself, to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them. 
And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized that just like us, we have a unique smell, that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell. 
And as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input." 
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes, where do you do that? How much effect does that have? 
They're acquirable, let me put it that way. 
And on then into the social sciences, where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority. 
So you go and find the paper, and what you find is an observational study. 
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place. 
OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain? 
We have to have a window into this." 
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about? 
That's how different these results are becoming. 
And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute. 
You're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital? 
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology, as in this example outside of Minneapolis. 
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris. 
We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. 
What is the story you most want for them to tell? 
But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. 
In fact, the lore for many years has been, "The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago, and it's been there ever since." 
LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.) (Applause) This is a picture of Maurice Druon, the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise, the French Academy. 
And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code, but it was using just amino acid single letter translations, which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet. 
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?" 
In America they say a period stop. 
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein. 
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through. 
(Applause) Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us. 
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also, that it deals with two problematic issues, which are rising waters and religion. 
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests. 
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph -- by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth -- that's another exponential. 
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. 
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories. 
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure. 
He went, "Oh." 
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field? 
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. 
And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent. 
They had profound intellectual disabilities. 
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation. 
You're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it. 
Gerard Manley Hopkins, a saintly man. 
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime, eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter) Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago. 
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. 
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while. 
It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto." 
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. 
And I'm just going to come out and say it: My daughter is not a wave. 
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick, so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore. 
So now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state. 
I tell them, "You are going to make it, and you will raise a healthy baby." 
We've been approached by several simulation companies, but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month, is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy, to predict the outcome of operations on these children. 
Now, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control anything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market and was the red line, it would be amazing! Right? 
And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year, when it happened again, and then the year after that, and then the year after that. 
We can all make a difference. 
There's a definition of leadership which says, "It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect." 
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength. 
The point isn't to live without any regrets. 
And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. 
After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie. 
It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. 
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. 
(Laughter) Or, sometimes I take them to places that people have never heard of because they're underwater. 
So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. 
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made? 
We do more than that. 
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it. 
And you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking. 
CA: So that's the key bottleneck, basically journalistic volunteers and/or the funding of journalistic salaries? 
You know, there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. 
Finally, they commit. 
And that's clearer now than it's been for decades. 
We needed to be working on beef. 
They belonged to boys. 
I didn't know how to talk about wine. 
So the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality. 
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them? 
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart. 
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists. 
I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. 
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone. 
Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. 
JF: Over on the left-hand side, you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off. 
It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine. 
Any society can adopt these institutions, and when they do, they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 -- only faster. 
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. 
In other words, we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building. 
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture, a concept that was developed by an entomologist, Timothy Myles. 
And there's a very good reason for that. 
And there were lots of widows and orphans, people like that, who needed a foster home. 
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less? 
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable. 
As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened. 
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing. 
You have a cassette with 10 samples. 
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves in ordinary people that we have now realized, and the aristocracy was convinced that the average person couldn't make it, that they could never share their mindset or their cognitive abilities. 
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before. 
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. 
A function is attributed to fiction. 
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism. 
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. 
So throughout vertebrates, the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours, which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do. 
We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity, who have the ability to confront the complex problems, ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions. 
PW: Blessing and curse. 
Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. 
It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. 
And we all need food. 
in four different continents, was depressingly familiar. 
And importantly, it's a rich source of vitamin B12. 
And that's where about half of our drugs come. 
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know. 
(Applause) And we systematically field tested, because in the field testing we learned some important lessons, and we went through many iterations. 
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two? 
He says, "We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke." 
We believe there's some water in the polar caps, there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. 
This should be taught in schools. 
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse. 
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics. 
This is the DARPA balloon challenge, where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said, "Use networks. 
It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison. 
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. 
And particularly, how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution and are more socially responsible? 
And then Marge Deton. 
This is a picture in a Japanese subway. 
The biological father is a nonissue. 
What are they doing? 
People who have access to these drugs stop dying. 
This is a cold-water event called La Nina. 
I dragged out this stuff, and it wasn't iron. 
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you." 
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. 
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again. 
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. 
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. 
But today, that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. 
I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.

For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be; but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick. 
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation -- the ability to confront problems, complex problems, and to design solutions to those problems. 
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks. 
It was a slow, cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs, millions of living chicken eggs. 
Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. 
♫ Wait it out ♫ (Applause) I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day, and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general. 
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it? 
It's so much fun to do. In fact, when I started doing them, I remember, because I got hurt. I had to get a knee surgery, right? So there were a couple of days where, actually a couple of weeks, where I couldn't skate at all. 
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.

Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. 
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. 
(Laughter) Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs. 
But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second. 
And there was an article written in the New York Times, September 2010, that stated: "Just Manic Enough." 
This is made from three ingredients: beets, barley, corn, and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat, looks and tastes like hamburger meat, and not only that, but it's basically removing the cow from the equation. 
And what I came to understand is, we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids. 
It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. 
As a young middle-class Nigerian activist, I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government. 
Burma didn't succeed. 
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. 
Bear in mind there are two things about this. 
(Applause) And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into -- you're teaching him how to be a woman." 
Pune has 5,000 building sites. 
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto. 
They're just not big enough. 
That's 8 a.m. shadows. 
But for me, personally, it was a real change. 
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. 
Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful, polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model. 
It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal. 
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen, hydrogen and zinc. 
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that, the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected. 
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue. 
If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans. 
Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them, three for evil spirits, one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love, paying their families a total of 16 cows. 
And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -- for example, this sound. 
We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies. 
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes." 
Why did we not find some other solution to this? 
Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English. 
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future. 
Why is that? 
As we were working on this, it dawned on us: this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths, and converting it into electrons. 
Power can also be positive sum, where your gain can be my gain. 
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. 
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom, to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers. 
We all use the same technology, and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys, they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. 
And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things. 
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more." 
And I was "other" before being anything else -- even before being a girl. 
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. 
And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. 
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter) For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket." 
It has two big differences with traditional version control systems. 
Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make. 
So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. (Laughter) (Robot noises) But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. 
We started with a motor with a little lever, a little force transfuser. 
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial. 
Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over; not at all. We are going on. 
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project. 
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes, that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies, their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy. 
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different -- everyone knows that. 
I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little. 
Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example, and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy -- all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.

Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame. 
I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education, which brought together top acousticians, government people, teachers, and so forth. 
And that might have been the case. 
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers." 
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over. 
And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. 
That's our value proposition in a prize. 
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough. 
So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force. 
PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is. 
And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. 
(Applause) Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you've got to pay attention. Complexity: if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down or your skill increases, so your perceptions change. 
When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe. 
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim, for one kilometer across the North Pole. 
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity. 
(Laughter) But I realized that life could be very boring, so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera -- my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing. 
These organisms, how are they insulating against their own electric charge? 
And also, space is incredibly vast. 
And I don't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function. 
I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. 
But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. 
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative, showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years. 
Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there. 
Artificial retinas, the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see. 
(Applause) (Applause) (Music) So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. 
There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest. 
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system, then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history. 
Somebody from India would know, of course. 
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity. 
We did not consult. We did not write a report. 
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them. 
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful. 
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. 
Eventually, I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall. 
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds. 
But it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is, to have an undefended heart. 
And you can see he looks always the same. 
He would say we are equal. 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, [very] strong for our well being. 
The federal government abdicated most responsibility. 
There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. 
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. 
You can see there's some signals there. 
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. 
And it just started about 14 months ago. 
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story. 
And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God, I mean I've changed this guy's body image, what about human subjects, ethics and all of that? 
Co-branding opportunities. 
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid; I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one, you know, what they were making. It was like a library, just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see, just floors and floors of these things, and one of the engineers said, some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. 
If they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing? 
But sometime ago, I discovered that if I cover my left eye, instead what I get is this. 
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. 
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera. 
I will never abandon you. 
And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture. 
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?" 
ED: Okay, good. 
I'd never heard of it. 
(Laughter) It's so simple that a computer could do it. 
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass, and then even at the level of structural steel, which you think of as being linear and modular. 
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control, or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together, which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces, so now this same kit of parts, this same unit can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom, or an office, a living space and secure storage. 
"Achilles was a man who could shape history, a man of destiny, and this is what you should be, Alexander." 
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side. 
What about longevity? 
Thank you very much. (Applause) I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time, which is to choose a light-hearted theme. 
There are other options for generating power as well which don't involve fossil fuels. 
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy. 
[Does] a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights? 
They could maybe volunteer that much. 
This is not about money. 
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked, including African-Americans, the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men. 
So, even though sometimes it's still hard, I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this, because of ideas like this, and people like you, with an open mind. 
Even if we choose to be silent, we chose to be silent. We're communicating something by choosing to be silent. 
Each cylinder is a parfait of time. 
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No. 
Politicians have recently begun Twittering. 
I don't have very many shots of people, because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form. 
To be compassionate is not a joke. 
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says, "Finally, they made something for us." 
Poop can cook your dinner. 
They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed. 
Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things, and we give that person status. 
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons. 
I didn't know what those things meant, neither did Dick -- neither did Sydney for that matter. 
So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on, I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. 
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child. 
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there. 
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation. 
If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential. 
Thank you very much. 
So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. 
Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January. 
We feel that this is an important gesture. 
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe. 
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is the theme, getting more from less for more. 
Well, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin. 
I heard stories that got inside my body. 
I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves, including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies. 
We don't have that kind of situation. 
Why has it been rising since the '70s? 
We’re doing the same thing as designers. 
These are not the only interesting robots. 
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones. 
He wrote about a car. 
Next part of the cold history lesson, the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution. 
We can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more, but only move the petals. 
I know that very well, because I was one of the lucky girls. 
(Laughter) CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. 
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years. 
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. 
And I think that we need to be more aware of, and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio. 
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy as it should, and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding, then the only alternative, really, is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. 
It's the only threat, the only influence that the reef had to deal with. 
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. 
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies. 
They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. 
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much. 
By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent of all digital information. 
(Laughter) CA: And so, in 10 years' time, what do you picture yourself doing? 
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air, and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK? 
So he designed a plotter as well, and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. 
But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design. 
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. 
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away from the current climate. 
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton. 
And quite frankly, that's a good question, but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here, so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate, right? 
There's still cancer in your patient." 
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning, will inevitably arise, so the question is, what is the best thing to do with it? 
It was dreadful. 
And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got 25 years earlier from their parents? 
And we are so close. 
This is what gives us the hopeless image. 
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing. 
You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it? 
The idea is that, as part of human nature, from the beginning of our species' time, men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. 
Suddenly, I had a body, a body that was pricked and poked and punctured, a body that was cut wide open, a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed, a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it, a body that was burning from chemicals. 
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that, you get 40 extra years of education. 
And fence line was amazing in itself. 
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. 
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. 
So take a look at that animal. 
They would be really useful." 
And some things look very familiar today. 
And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. 
But that can't be the answer, because these drugs actually don't work all that well. 
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?" 
So, with the advice of my physician, I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital. 
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector. 
But if you look in Africa, there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside. 
Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play. 
We actually have the technology and systems. 
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet. 
Of course, it doesn't make any difference. 
Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale. 
The car is so big, the camera is so small, yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual. 
But here I am. 
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. 
The gap has widened since I left. 
We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter, and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize, is very different than in the summer. 
(Applause) On a more personal note, this betrayal of our principles, our decency, our hope, made it impossible for me to avoid the question, "What will I say, years from now, when people ask, 'Where were you?'" As president of a leading liberal arts college, famous for its innovative history, there were no excuses. 
There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey. 
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina, this is the home that I grew up in, OK? 
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me because I'm a godless person. 
So you've effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research. 
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?" 
And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine. It really is." 
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA, working for the jet propulsion laboratory, and there our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system, and today I want to show you what we've done so far. 
You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes. 
You're a director, you've done it for years." 
This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. 
It's that simple. 
And now, once again, the technology genie is out of the bottle, but this time it's different. 
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles. 
We have a video to show you. 
It's not like the teddy bear. 
And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace. 
And it really changed the landscape of surgery. 
So we did a simple analysis, and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year, your fishery is going to collapse very quickly. 
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫ ♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫ ♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫ ♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫ ♫ Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫ ♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫ ♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫ 
I keep saying, "Nets, you live in the past while I'll create the future, and when I'm done, you can study about it." 
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. 
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. 
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean. 
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter) And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. 
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. 
Well, we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is, you know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. 
So their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different, and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police. 
(Applause) Last question, Julian. 
Well, the wind is inanimate; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent. 
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women. 
So, this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation. 
That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning. 
But a year later, I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. 
And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner. 
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. 
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers. 
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house. 
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. 
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here. 
There were a couple that were a little stubborn, but I had to talk to them. 
And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain. 
And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there, but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. 
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly. 
Leadership matters. Those men are following the orders of a superior officer. 
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. 
We knew so little in those days, as little as now, I suppose about healing those hurts: even the women, in their best dresses, with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices, even in lipstick and mascara, their hair aflow, could only stand wringing their hands, begging for peace, while father and son, like thugs, like thieves, like Romans, simmered and hissed and hated, inflicting sorrows that endured, the worst anyway, through the kiss and embrace, bleeding from brother to brother, into the generations. 
You think that's not an issue going forward? 
It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi-polar. 
(Applause) So in 2011, power shifted, from the few to the many, from oval offices to central squares, from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks. 
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta. 
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. 
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga. 
But they lose, right? 
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. 
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way, in her bead shop in London. 
Hmm. You've heard of it. 
They're not the same thing. 
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say, to break out of their own cocoon of the public self, and the more public they had been, the more entrenched that person, that outer person was. 
He did this because he understands data as well as books. 
And went from swimming one lap -- so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey, at about 200 beats per minute heart rate -- I measured it -- to going to Montauk on Long Island, close to where I grew up, and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water, getting out and feeling better than when I went in. 
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation, does not dilute away as the universe expands. 
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago, there were 3,000 people that lived in the Galapagos. 
It's already immersed in social networks. 
(Laughter) But what was interesting was, the Pakistani Muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world. 
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. 
RNA provides the information for protein. 
So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986. 
"You mean, like, in the car?" 
Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. 
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can. 
Thank you. 
RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it: the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico. 
The machines are all running, absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are. 
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12. 
So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor. 
As human beings, we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present. 
(Applause) I think we're all aware that the world today is full of problems. 
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. 
But it is a gross distortion of reality. 
By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?" 
When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth, his hands moved as if in slow motion. 
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music? 
And in Seattle, we take these -- this is a whole human hemisphere -- and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer. 
And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown, and you thought, "Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me. 
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds -- one in the world of the African technology community, one in the world of the American technology community. 
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data on the web, which he called dbpedia. 
We don't value play. 
I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education, are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative. 
Then we go into final shaping, "panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan. 
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't. 
Perhaps something very naughty. 
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. 
We've had dance people up in the canopy. 
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you. 
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today: that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. 
I love to do synthetic biology. 
It is a completely different notion. 
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl. 
In rodents, it was known to make mothers care for their offspring, and in some creatures, allowed for toleration of burrowmates. 
(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies, 75 percent of your risk is that first flight. 
So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. 
I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. 
I mean, this could be huge. 
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there, where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. 
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers, arthritis ruins more lives. 
The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too. 
And that to me as well, that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds, well Many Worlds theory -- one of the most beautiful, fascinating, sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation -- is a wonderful thing. 
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. 
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. 
And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production. 
We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world, like Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge. 
But for an Adventist woman, their life expectancy is 89. 
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. 
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too. 
(Laughter) Now it's just the way it is. 
So armed with these two ideas, that science is a way of being and experiments are play, we asked, can anyone become a scientist? 
He's back to his normal life. 
What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. 
But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. 
They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure. 
(Applause) Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure, so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. 
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water, and because we weren't working on the bottom, I brought along a shark cage here, and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage. 
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily. 
For example, all masks are made in China. 
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. 
I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. 
And then it became news. 
We may take the Gaian view. 
It was gratifying musically, but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum, and that is as visual artist. (Laughter) We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter) I am multitudes. (Laughter) So one of the things is that, I mean, some people would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante," and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean, because I don't have a pedigree in visual art and I don't have any training, but it's just something 
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself. 
And so you see this in junior high a lot. 
He's the guy that kind of discovered me, and kind of got me going in digital media. 
So, the match was ended in between. 
You just know that you have certain beliefs. 
Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new. 
So, if you could bring up the lights. 
As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. 
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. 
So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. 
I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place. 
And so our monkey marketplace was born. 
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. 
All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. 
Marcus: A modern day poet. 
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? 
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. 
The European Union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators. 
So I started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity? 
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas. 
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. 
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do -- I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials, that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter) But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know, they would only let me do other things. 
These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity, Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different, they're such ambitious projects at scale. 
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: "chesed." 
Kick, kick, kick. 
He won 375 electoral votes. 
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century. 
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing. 
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. 
Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane? 
It's more ideological than practical, but it turns out it's an easy question. 
And let me show you a simple example. 
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death. 
All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know, it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents. 
They're motivated by something else -- motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs. 
And I was so thrilled. 
Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter. 
There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book. 
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel, that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. 
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes. 
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist, just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think, in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective, and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. 
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it. 
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained. 
'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said. 
With this kind of imaging -- this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging -- we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries. 
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here. 
Well, if you denounce, you're probably never going to get back in the room. 
We were a little bit rattled. 
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case? 
We learned to play the instruments, but we kind of had to come from within or go from within, because we didn't watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of radio. We went to church and to school sometimes, and farmed and played music, so we were able, I think, at a very critical age to develop our own style, our own self, and my mother plays, my father plays, and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario, we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps. 
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?" 
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind. 
It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and everybody was about to race out toward the stars. 
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true. 
And so, the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool, which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles. 
Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook, and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated, meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. 
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. 
There is my world and there is your world, and my world is always better than your world, because my world, you see, is rational and yours is superstition. 
And this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world. 
And we don't want to have this argument. 
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion. 
He wrote a paper on this. 
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best. 
I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. 
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. 
Questions can be windows to great instruction, but not the other way around. 
(Laughter) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. 
Conditions are very difficult, but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work. 
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon. 
These are four very different ways of looking at the world. I even gave them names. 
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not. 
Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. 
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. 
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China, gave them to Chinese to see how they would react. 
It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there. 
We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it, we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes -- and here it was doing something that we didn't know about. 
Thank you very much indeed. 
So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. 
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count, but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist, I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. 
And so I started a collaboration with this person, Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient. 
We will extend the same system into other areas, like dialysis treatment. 
So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future. 
We have to invest, in fact, in the idea of a meaningful prosperity, providing capabilities for people to flourish. 
We do that in our solar system. 
(Laughter) But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work. 
(Laughter) But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and -- (Laughter) (Applause) Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. 
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. 
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. 
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. 
It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it. 
Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done, it has been done, and it's being done now in more than a few cities, around the globe and in our country. 
They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff. 
What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche? 
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. 
And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad, but I kept remaining a fan of yours. 
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter) They never did anything. 
First of all, you're going to hit obstacles. 
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. 
Okay, there it goes. 
She did it for three years. 
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator. 
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. 
Two years ago, we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site, a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda, the Royal Kasubi Tombs. 
The key to all this is reinforcing civil society. 
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one, we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on. 
We're in charge. It's frightening. 
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well. 
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. 
One of those key indicators is: How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day? 
The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. 
So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists, a collective of Japanese artists -- (Laughter) in Tokyo. 
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats, we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. 
The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing. 
And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. 
And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake, because they must be hiding. 
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity. 
(Laughter) It was great. 
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues, about sustainability, about lower power consumption. 
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. 
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe. 
I've planted a hundred trees in a day. 
They didn't even want to go there. 
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock, and floating if it isn't. 
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread. 
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. 
And as it happened, I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. 
Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future? 
Suddenly humans show up -- Homo erectus -- big, old melon-head. 
So I'm going to bake bread for you. 
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. 
The children came running in. 
So to put that number in perspective, for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class, he would have to do that for 250 years. 
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative. 
for the last hundred years, which isn't where we want to be right now. 
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person? 
(Applause) Now, let's go to the visuals. 
Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. 
And then you have a third party saying, "Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy." 
So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program, and people line up to mics to ask questions. 
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. 
All this data about you should just be conveyed, and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. 
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. 
And second, it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment, and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in. 
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. 
This one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway, he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female. 
Why is Wired magazine doing this? 
How do you do it? 
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side. 
Well, it's just so interesting that Donnell's upbringing was very similar to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play when I was about 12 years old, and he and his family came to Inverness, which is about 45 minutes from where I lived, and I was just blown away, like, it was just amazing, and you'll find out why pretty soon here, but I couldn't believe the fiddling and Mom was there with me, and she was saying — Donnell's mother came up on stage and danced with her children, and Mom was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell, I used to dance with her when we 
Now, we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world -- these tiny sensors that gather data in nature, the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used, and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute. 
Now we want those devices, of course, to be deployed by those who are in the trenches, our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child, and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice, because they have to see so many children. 
So how do we do it? 
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. 
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. 
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se. 
It's coming, but we're not there yet. 
I call that the Leviathan Force. 
(Laughter) Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s, before I had gotten married and had my three sons, I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys. 
But again, it's kind of surprising. You wouldn't really expect that. 
And that was run by them. 
The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. 
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work. 
But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid. 
Thank you very much. 
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little, "Shh -- it's not really them," was put on the side of the imagery. 
It's a civilizational story to begin with. 
Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage. 
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. 
Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective, a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests, many different agendas, many different individuals, many different points of view. 
So then you have to make the decision. 
And then the surprise turns into hope. 
Then we are going to apply them to the other areas, like energy, ecology, policy law and ethics, entrepreneurship, so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. 
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. 
So, once a month for the last year, I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty," which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is, but I know I can throw that around now. You know, it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know. 
So that afternoon, I went back to my house, and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler, came running to meet me. 
It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong. 
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home. 
BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. 
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. 
Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space, and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. 
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from." 
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree. 
The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. 
And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. 
It's built on gold. 
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating. 
(Applause) Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning. 
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men." 
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. 
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes, so that no one knows how you voted. 
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique. 
I leave the scene immediately. 
And so this is what I want to emphasize that, as you can imagine, all of these tricks are made of sub-movements, executive motor functions, more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you, but one thing I do know is, every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements. And so, as I'm going up, these things are floating around, and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind, like, rest back, pull it back a little bit, and let your intuition go as you feel these things. 
So those are just some of our goals. 
But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane, physical details. 
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show. 
Here it is, which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita, unlike biology -- higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger, more patents per capita, more crime per capita. 
It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet. 
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. 
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak -- when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. 
And this is the F1 MV Agusta. 
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. 
And so in this game, I've learned so much from it, but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world, they may save us all. 
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these. 
Why does it take me months on end to get an export license from London or New York in order to get pieces into my country? 
There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. 
Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. 
The bottom line is, whether you're in it or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting. 
And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. 
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing." 
Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. 
Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. 
But if we did this in every single -- every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. 
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try. 
I did not start to make social commentary about my country. 
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. 
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons, and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets. 
Okay. Let me criticize this thing. 
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person, you could put it in another person, and it would work. 
People are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built. 
I also, with the story, wanted to show readers how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish, like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world. 
Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. 
All those I've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain, again, very fast. 
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly, a kind of second skin, which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms. 
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable. 
Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. 
Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life. 
And for the following 25 years, living in Italy, living in America, I doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who'd pay for it -- this sense, this aesthetic feeling, for the experience revolving around a designed object. 
Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact, so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy. 
And you know, these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. 
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women, and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. 
Now I want to step back a bit. 
And so it’s not something -- happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get. 
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful. 
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. 
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. 
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. 
Also, at Synthetic Genomics, we've been working on major environmental issues. 
It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets." 
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. 
(Laughter) Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. 
Now, of course, this is an underestimation. 
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors, move liquid through pipes. 
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one. 
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches. 
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect. 
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me. 
They will bring it and link it in. 
Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base. 
I have to say, I don't understand it. 
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes, and two, it does not look like as expected. 
They're very little understood. 
Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. 
So for instance, several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. 
We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone. 
Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. 
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. 
And this is, of course, the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation. 
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA. 
And the interview was 40 pages long. 
We tend to form clusters based on similarity, and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. 
And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called "the optical delusion of everyday consciousness." 
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot. 
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. 
And the how was harmony, stacking up the pitches to form chords. 
We also talked about the White Shark Cafe. 
However, under some circumstances, it can happen. 
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. 
And she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. 
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old. 
It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share. 
I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate? 
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. 
And so we need to rethink this idea. 
It said "David, age 10." 
I was always worried about being caught and sent back. 
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail." 
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world. 
And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between. 
And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan, that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy, when people are so disgusted by, for example, the burning of the Koran. 
And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed. 
But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood? 
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals. 
And we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here. 
Health just takes more time. 
What are the dates again? 
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s. 
So what you've done is to take a technology, which is available everywhere, make a device, which is extremely cheap, and make it in such a fashion that it is very, very reliable. 
And again, that's a question we can answer. 
If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" -- who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. 
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea, was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big, and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow, and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something. 
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. 
Of course, the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you! 
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are, but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. 
In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints. 
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. 
And one of them is the lacking buying power. 
I actually came across this fascinating study by the Pew Center this week that revealed that an active Facebook user is three times as likely as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy. 
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. 
You collect interest and do nothing in between. 
Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 
These words, they stuck with me. 
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state. 
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade. 
Zero dollars a month. 
But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change. 
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them. 
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting. 
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres, just because that's where we're making observations. 
And then with four screws, we put in a frame, then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes, to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy, where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. 
Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. 
So I'd like you to do something for me. 
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list, and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction. 
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. 
In fact -- (Applause) Thank you. 
We need to combine this with the scientific method. 
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. 
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants. 
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students. 
This is the legacy of manifest destiny. 
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes." 
(Applause) I'm a storyteller. 
I was proud to be part of that work, and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities. 
So about a year and a half ago, we started working on a project called WikiHouse, and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system. 
It's also true -- and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways, you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right. 
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me, and I'm going to take my lumps on this one." 
And I tell them I sleep like a baby: I wake up crying every two hours. 
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. 
Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. 
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel. 
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts. 
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate. 
The teapot could be full, it could be empty. 
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the "flow experience." 
Now, if we continue this process, we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21, 21 by 34, and so on. 
Okay, this is skimming stones. 
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn, how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene? 
It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. 
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber, in a small market town in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London. 
In fact, I can look over here, and this is kind of a little simplified food web that's going on with the creatures. 
Not very long. OK. 
We are them. They are us. 
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers? 
These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. 
But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old." 
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done? 
Upon my arrival in New York, I decided -- they were children of sugar plantation workers. 
So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear. 
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile. 
Here, I'm going to put it out there, later on tonight, and I want you to pick it up and handle it. 
Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life? 
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment, many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid. 
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?" 
And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this, we're really creating a moment. 
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further. 
And so they want to see live witnesses. 
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. 
But over the course of these nine months, I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients -- that by the time they came to us, they were already in crisis. 
We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information, and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. 
They are multinational, as I say, they are branded, they have a clear identity, so they don't get lost in a busy world. 
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. 
And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent. 
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. 
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole. 
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator. 
And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure, to pretend they know things when they don't know things, or why would we be where we are? 
People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. 
(Applause) So, before I became a dermatologist, I started in general medicine, as most dermatologists do in Britain. 
In fact, entirely reflexive. 
And our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight, which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable." 
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron, which means the little carbon atom. 
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia. 
Here are two different jewelry displays. 
It is where a third of all the traffic is going. 
So it gives us virtual access to the lungs, which is where many important diseases reside. 
(Laughter) All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. 
For me, today, on this date, it's like a second bar mitzvah experience. 
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid. 
The solution to all of this is pretty easy. 
And again, as I told you, if they have a caring family and good work life, then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. 
He's the father of the ethanol revolution. 
We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. 
It doesn't mean you have to get through school. 
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. 
A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it. 
A third time, it's just being a technician. 
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. 
But in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record, it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods -- I call this the "slow hunch." 
That's what they are to you. 
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension: 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. 
They would offer sweets or money. 
Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Archaea and, eventually, eukaryotes. 
(Laughter) Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right, and you haven't been conferring, and so on. 
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. 
Oh course, you might think, what's left without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh? 
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution. 
Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that. 
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. 
(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking. 
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact, wild and now protected -- entirely protected -- in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park. 
You just need a few people -- (Laughter) -- who will look at the rules, realize they make no sense, and realize how much they want to be connected. 
Well, having found that and published that, I thought, well, what's it doing? 
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept. 
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world. 
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life. 
Goldman Sachs projected 2027. 
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. 
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time; you could not just Google in '91. 
It's really dangerous. 
So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember. 
We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that. 
That big shield that you see outside, that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. 
Isn't that beautiful? 
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. 
They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading. 
There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was, "The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you, who think you're going to come to this town and make movies." 
The government finally made a decision that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda. 
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. 
What do organized religions do? 
I mean, does it have to be this painful, top-down process? 
The population's going to double from one billion to two billion, so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years. 
TS: It is the paint actually, makes it real. 
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. 
And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied. 
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society? 
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture, and the way that the trees form vertical elements. 
(Laughter) I mean, I've heard about that. 
If I stand beside that truck, my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap. 
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. 
Right now. 
This meant not only an artistic triumph, but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of Latin America, as seen in Venezuela, giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy, enthusiasm and strength. 
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less, or to graduate from college instead of dropping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be small. 
That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution. 
So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer, you created true value. 
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute. 
The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children. 
If you think that, you've forgotten high school. 
So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection. 
That's the way the system works. 
The curator had only one condition: I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork. 
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared. 
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent. 
There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us. 
If the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit, and gradually the relationship breaks down. 
When you have two outliers in one organism, it's not a coincidence. 
So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. 
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white? 
And I mean books everywhere around the house. 
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing. 
Here's another couple. (Laughter) And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter) In fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see him saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera, and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face." (Laughter) He'll kill me for showing that. 
They had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. 
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered, some of these species -- create 600 volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body. 
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, "I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. 
(Applause) As other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience. 
So, we've made a whole series of instruments. 
I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket." 
This is Siberian Actinobacteria, which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old. 
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict. 
And just so you know, 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. 
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school. 
Okay, look at that. It's a darkslide. 
The folks at AeroVironment tried 300 or more different wing designs, 12 different forms of the avionics. 
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity, where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality. 
Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. 
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene. 
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface. 
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. 
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission, they need all the help that they can get. 
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness, is very much under threat as well. 
So they all split, and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space. 
I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get, I go look for more. 
Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like? 
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche, mood swings, personalities and so on. 
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions. 
The bathrooms and kitchens will, of course, have no windows. 
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right, along with the economic value that goes with it. 
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. 
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. 
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism. 
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable. 
And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible. 
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast, your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off, and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER, because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. 
And he used this following analogy. 
Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience. 
But let me end with something I think much more important -- much more important than business. 
That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view, with twice the amount of CO2 in the air. 
And we use their technique. 
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. 
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now." 
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do. 
But in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the Equator as well. 
Jack of diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.) LG: Yes? 
Woman: An olive server. 
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see. 
So, we gather around, we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it. 
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves. 
It's just a sick, silly joke. 
(Piano notes) Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note? 
And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie. 
And in our lab, we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other, more specialized, cells, which one day may be used as cell transplants. 
It's this lamp, as you can see here. 
And we just put these two together in the same system. 
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria, the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam -- although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth, and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. 
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. 
So this is the strange demographic of the zone -- isolated alone together. 
And he's teaching her how to browse. 
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. 
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press — (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. 
So our energy future is not fate, but choice, and that choice is very flexible. 
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real. 
So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. 
I think it will be great. 
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment, you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from. 
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space. 
Now, the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry. 
And we really, we really loved this machine. 
And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things, but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck. 
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. 
BJ: Breath is really important for us. 
The range of digital relations is extraordinary. 
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do. 
But we did see a bunch of responses like this. 
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about. 
We have a choice. We've been blessed, or cursed, with free will. 
(Applause) You've been a great audience. 
You are certified by the community you serve. 
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right. 
So we did an experiment. 
It's an American, American soldiers, American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East -- in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
A real airplane that we could finally present. 
So having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything, because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda. 
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there. 
This is a straw. 
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life. 
There's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. 
Or terror, as the case may be? Right? 
My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries, but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent of Africa, because usually, when people talk about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence? 
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters. 
Because first of all, there's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists. 
You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you. 
There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here, overwintering survival. 
And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. 
As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers. 
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic. 
Take this representation of all of the land. 
Now 3D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production. 
And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter into living matter, into inorganic biology. 
(Laughter) I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes: either Catherine would come back to the hotel, or she would never come back to the hotel. 
We were once just as certain that the world was flat. 
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up around five, if that's OK with you. 
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics, where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong. 
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. 
But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years. 
Languages are genes talking, getting things that they want. 
Remember I said feeling, model, reality; I said reality doesn't change. It actually does. 
This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage. 
I really don't want to just say "I'm great," because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. 
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010, with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. 
I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. 
But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt. 
Now that's a before and after image, but you don't read the image on the screen like that. 
None of those things were stirring. 
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, "This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it." 
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. 
The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs -- it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. 
One was his daughter, Laurence. 
Did Africa feed itself? 
The other is obviously a computer mouse. 
This is as of 9 a.m. this morning. 
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. 
She's under the underdogs. 
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error. 
And there's a simple principle of strategy that says: Do unto yourself before others do unto you. 
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. 
You can't control real people, as you probably know. 
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence, the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout. 
Trust is the response. 
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. 
RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top, generally speaking, works. 
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones. 
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa. 
I'm proposing three planks. 
Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1, 21 digits long, was not prime. 
What do I mean by that? 
What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens, fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old could be used to bring species back, what would you do? Where would you start? 
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age -- I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning, not a forecast. That was before -- I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted? 
Who are you? 
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. 
Symmetry, pairs. 
And it was very sad for me, because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. 
So no ego problems. 
And this, of course, climaxed in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s. 
That is what I need for my characters in my books: a passionate heart. 
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow, tell various stories through different mediums. 
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need. 
But the system has moved me on because, as my family started to discover, there is no long-term concept in the health care system. 
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it. 
So of course, in reality, we were then panicked, being the biologists, and we should know this already. 
That database contained the timing of attacks, the location, the size and the weapons used. 
But he didn't confess to treason. 
I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. 
Lastly, I want to talk about growth. 
(Applause) And then I thought, "Why stop there? 
In reward terms, it's not money; it's not being given cash -- that's nice -- it's doing stuff with our peers, watching us, collaborating with us. 
The American way, to quote Burger King, is to "have it your way," because, as Starbucks says, "happiness is in your choices." 
I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. 
And he'll say, "You're offering me things that are infinitely variable." 
(Laughter) And it's very interesting to see that the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu, number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. 
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework? 
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. 
But they localize it. 
In the green room I received my uniform. 
It's not taught in universities. 
Chris. 
This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients, not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body, but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls. 
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. 
These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate. 
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 
And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. 
Thank you so much for your time, and good luck with your record. (Applause) We live in difficult and challenging economic times, of course. 
And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around. 
You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored. 
And then the skin starts transforming into other materials. 
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. 
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull. 
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon. 
Mark Cutkosky, though, is taking it a step further. 
This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event. 
And these dyes change color in response to odors. 
Here's a clue. 
Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north. 
And one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty, something stupefyingly delicious, is what I call the OMG. 
Because we didn't talk. 
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well. 
"That's what I thought," she said. 
And because I'm an underwater photographer, I wanted to do this story from both above and below, to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water. 
Civil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here. 
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. 
Jung may have called it "the subconscious." 
Now, each one of them is thinking, "I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me. 
When we get negative feedback, we still, the next time we're face with a certain context, tend to make the same errors. 
But anyway. 
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time. 
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. 
That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home. 
The issue is not that. 
And I went to that address and knocked on the door, and a man answered the door. 
People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. 
(Applause) Both myself and my brother belong to the under 30 demographic, which Pat said makes 70 percent, but according to our statistics it makes 60 percent of the region's population. 
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story. 
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment. 
(Laughter) And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. 
And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems -- in the initial iteration of our organization, we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service. We had a lot of success, and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm. 
There is something more though that has to be there. 
Now, what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean, That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. 
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not. 
So this is a limitation. 
It was in the paper -- not on the front page. 
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor, and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant. 
And one of the second commonest is cartoons. 
And you can hit it again. That's kind of ham-fisted. You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever, so you don't do that. 
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works. 
They're the largest private user of electricity. 
We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. 
So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though. 
So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia? 
The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives. 
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. 
We had a big party at the end. 
What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden? 
The outcome, immediate. 
So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. 
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. 
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. 
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet. 
So now we're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration, it will accelerate outcomes. 
The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law. 
There's something else about them that you see -- they don't see themselves. 
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo? 
In there he talked about the divided self. 
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. 
We made it, and we were connected to it that way. 
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX -- Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. 
Triceratops, if you've heard the news, a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. 
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George. 
So we should get started now. 
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions. 
All the stories began to bleed together. 
And you all know roughly the story. 
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room-- well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room. 
There are a billion stars in the galactic core, which is why it's shining out so brightly. 
And I started to train. 
And then it is 40 feet deep. 
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. 
So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles. 
And when it rains hard rain, I scream and I run in circles. 
So that was kind of my first dream, was to start this company called FEED, and here's a screenshot of our website. 
I asked them what kind of building it was. 
There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. 
And what we see is a line of stars. 
So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes, and he promised to pay for all the work. 
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. 
And they sort of fly away, out of your head. 
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. 
So let's apply this principle to Siberia. 
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes. 
So, there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market, so we really believe it is critical to think of it. 
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions. 
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders. 
Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here? 
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together. 
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more. 
That statistic is so sad. 
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right? 
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. 
People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs. 
And here you see the model: a reception building and some underground parking. 
But they did what they could to stabilize the people. 
To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk. 
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. 
Enjoy it while it lasts. 
We were in radio contact with some of them. 
He entered our trial. 
And I said, "Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them, to see if you approve of them. 
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods, hiking and taking "samples" -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. 
There's another hub in London, now, and the rest are getting set up. We hope to give the data away at some stage. That's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world. 
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. 
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway. 
And so they still weren't getting it. 
It just extrudes. 
So before agriculture, before the agricultural revolution, it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. 
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April. 
What newspaper was it in? What book? 
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began, Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky. 
They have done what I desire to do for them. 
Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. 
Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever, that would happen. 
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. 
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED, will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people, probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards, and say that actually, it comes out of the ground. 
He's 29 years old, very well-built, lean, he's six-foot, five, weighs 265 lbs., and he is down. 
And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life. 
(Laughter) I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. 
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. 
And here we are now. 
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. 
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. 
Complex civilizations do that, because they operate, most of the time, on the edge of chaos. 
So the production side is working. 
Ask me. 
It does not intervene in this process or this one. 
One way around this is to draw pictures. 
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. 
Another millimeter? 
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" 
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials -- and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software -- you can make some terrific ribs. 
It was never popular with many political leaders, especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't. 
That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really, really old. 
You know, I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years, there's hope in that. 
Before making my own Mother's Day card, I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. 
And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. 
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period and finally and definitively, an ant period. 
(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. 
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived, what their generation time was, that's about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching, in which that hand axe didn't change. 
So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion. 
I thank you for your attention. 
In the United States, we know the pathetic figures: 18 percent of Americans approve of Congress and what they do. 
(Laughter) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over. 
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name; it's just the two of us standing there. 
People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on. 
Thank you. (Applause) Something happened in the early morning hours of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect on the way our society operates. 
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book -- Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about. 
It's going to take longer for some things. 
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying. 
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic, that's the expectation from demographers, going forward. 
They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. 
They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control. 
What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love, care, and unreserved passion. 
I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of, some yet uninvented technology. 
I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions: "Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?" 
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down, and it also took panoramic pictures. 
Not impressive. 
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. 
Someone else bought it and died. 
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time. 
(Laughter) I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home, and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible! 
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. 
So thanks to this student who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true, this project taught me an important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions. 
But the cool part is the user interface. 
It was about the norms for cheating. 
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow. 
And the idea is not to cure autism. 
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu, and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia. 
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population. 
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. 
Most of the animals are in the oceans. 
The whole thing about my house, the whole use of rough carpentry and everything, was the frustration with the crafts available. 
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as "wrong" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags? 
Not just the priests. Everybody. 
It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. 
We're now going to turn it on. 
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. 
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept. 
That is, that there are chambers inside, they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it. 
And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her. 
Somebody must have started something like that. 
This is what one of nature's finest machines. 
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort": And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. 
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect. 
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. 
We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. 
But the price of its dominance is enormous. 
So I'm happy she's here. 
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. 
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us. 
These drugs aren't cures, but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence at least for those who can access them. 
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. 
So that's the conventional approach. 
So, jack of spades. 
Now to put this in perspective, let me just zoom out for a minute. 
It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. 
To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I read through the literature on anthropology, on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches. 
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. 
Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle. 
And in a way, I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff, wondering what to do. 
It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations. 
And whether we call them 440 per second, A, or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right -- they're just phenomena. 
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. 
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?" 
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. 
For me, it was really about the process. 
So, that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions: conflicts of interest. 
Because back then, we were building a trades program. 
But he was also human. 
This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course. 
But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little, tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast, and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke-by-stroke basis, and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory. 
So I -- (Laughter) I took my camera, I took my notebook, took a chair, and started to observe this behavior. 
So here's Bangladesh. 
But you might ask, well so what in any case? 
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. 
I'm the embodiment of all truth." 
In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize. 
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. 
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range, 40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe. 
And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. 
And she was very relieved at this, that there was nothing seriously the matter, and also rather curious. 
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a AAA, though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies. 
I realize that's an ambiguous statement. 
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. 
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves. 
This is an MRI MRA MRV, a volumetric MRI. 
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura, 50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border. 
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans. 
The open world is bringing freedom. 
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness, by accelerating in a centrifuge. 
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true. 
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric? 
And it grows on a very regular daily basis. 
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule. 
He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. 
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park." 
Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes. 
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years, but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. 
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. 
What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur? 
And fortunately, it's right in here. 
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts." 
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau, three very famous mountains in Switzerland. 
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas. 
But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me, because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. 
How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?" 
There's more. 
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it. 
So the eye, after a while, can distinguish these two very well. 
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril," that is, in danger of extinction. 
(Laughter) The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against. 
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust. 
I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. 
And also, the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. 
Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans. 
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder, it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye. 
Your kids are easy to train. 
Even with the sacred printing press, we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals. 
In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. 
Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia. 
That was common practice in the industry, and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome. 
We're becoming desensitized. 
More people are living there than the land could possibly support. 
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. 
To really understand it, you've got to say, "Oh, I get it. 
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. 
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that, and they can move on to the next assignment. 
And now look at this: not friendly. 
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son. 
So, what do you do? 
For the performance, the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house, and the residents, who were the performers, they came out of their houses, and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns, on their driveways. (Laughter) The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based performance company called Lone Twin. 
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level, and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment. 
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. 
We call it "proofing." 
No, you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores." 
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. 
Rhythm is half silence. 
The agony as an act of passion." 
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. 
I think it will come from a spectrum like this. 
It's about all of us. 
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. 
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years -- that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged? 
That's grown this year to about 10. 
I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then, you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future, and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks. 
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. 
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own. 
We can't afford to pull back from the world. 
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. 
Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. 
It's called "Fashion Statement," and there are quotes about fashion, so you can read it, and also, because the definition of artist book is very generous. 
This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border. 
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. 
There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles. 
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages, says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over, and it's so safe it carries no insurance. 
Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over 1,000 years. 
I could do it again to show it one more time, but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it. 
But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. 
And he said he was never really afraid of this. 
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners, but everybody. 
I liked this one the best: a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars. 
This is actually in a riparian area. 
So, just to give you an example of how they did it -- not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. 
So when you talk about expensive power, the cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds. 
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience, so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look, that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life, our health and well being, our social behavior and our productivity. 
And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see, and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play, just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. 
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out, have to reach out, beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. 
He's the mascot of the expo, and he looks strangely familiar. 
But the difference is that these cultures never expand, never grow, never accumulate, never become combinatorial, and the reason is because there is no sex, as it were, there is no exchange of ideas. 
Ladies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words. 
It's been a roller coaster ride. 
Mystery number one is this: Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. 
And we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare DNA sequences among us here in the room, for example. 
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability. 
And I believe that. I believe that. 
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. 
So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. 
But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ... 
(Laughter) They buy these seaweed-based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale, which is for kids who come home and say, "Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer." 
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition. 
(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.) MS: It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart. 
Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. 
They measure very, very carefully. 
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front, would we have better control? 
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. 
So, that's what I have. Thanks very much. 
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off! 
They can also choose not to do that, but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with early last century, facing forcible measures by government. So they'd better jump now. 
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport. 
Defeat would have come too easily. 
When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math. 
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. 
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. 
A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane, and the two won't mix. 
Some architectures. 
Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010, we responded to the tsunami in Chile, the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border. 
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance, and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose, as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth. 
Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. 
Make these better, because we can afford them." 
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. 
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative. 
Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. 
But for me, this is a wonderful opportunity where technology, at last, can be connected with, where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. 
(Laughter) This has a diamond-bottomed lake. 
So the friend of a friend of A's is, back again, a friend of A's, whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's, but is farther away in the network. 
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit. 
Even if, when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! -- 85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting -- I know you've had this experience -- that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere." 
Don't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash. The rich people do. Go get some. 
Plants are not living creatures -- this is the point. 
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... 
You become very creative, in a survival sense. 
So do you still not want to continue?" 
Well, that's because they're all young. 
So, if we make no changes today, what does tomorrow look like? 
The seer of clouds had to take account of it. 
And this was Steen Rasmussen. 
Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras over the last three years, and relocated them in nearby forests. 
That's all I'd ever known. 
I am an emotional creature. 
But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing. 
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. 
The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments. 
And what I've found is that our little devices, those little devices in our pockets, are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do, they change who we are. 
That's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster. 
And still, those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. 
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built. 
In the 1970s, the One Percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States. 
And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem, and it has to do with performance. 
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz, in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient, but poor. 
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West. 
They're all gone. 
And this is what we're pursuing here. 
They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design. 
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. 
And it didn't stop there. 
The thing that is exciting was, in 1976, I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars, or I guaranteed the money at the bank. 
And that doesn't make any sense at all, because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older. 
He was home alone a lot. 
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet, put it in your office and you can make a living doing it. 
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. 
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives. 
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer, except there was one problem. 
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff, and all the nerdy stuff out of it, and try to make it as beautiful as we can. 
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change. 
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. 
I am productive. 
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there. 
Are we any more rational about sex? 
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms to affect lifespan, and here it affects lifespan in people. 
A few years ago, the first sea lord of the British admiralty -- he is called the first sea lord, although the chief of the army is not called a land lord — he said that we, and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West, that we suffer from sea blindness. 
is even larger. 
Do you hear me? Do you hear me? 
So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon, maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for. 
And the answer would appear to be yes, and the language would appear to be food. 
And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer. 
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion. 
AM: In these? 
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed, but then Kenya and Ghana go down together -- still a standstill in Congo. 
If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides, there is now a solution. 
And that's the way it is with definitions of words. 
So, people often ask me: What can I do? 
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?" 
When we include these, each matter particle has two different spin charges, spin-up and spin-down. 
Decades later, it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection. 
I have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation. 
But the materiality matters too, because in every society that anthropologists have looked at, material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods, a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories, for example, about how important we are. 
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community. 
They still go up in the short run. 
Was yours unhappy?" 
And the Dutch, when they usually put it, it always starts with the same two words. 
So they started to think, "Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts?" 
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it. 
Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly -- very, very low odds, so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all. 
That's around 130 billion dollars a year -- it's a lot. 
And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made. 
We have transferred enough energy." 
I moaned about it, I hesitated, I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife, and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. 
We see them come up with more interesting, and just more, ideas so they can choose from better ideas. 
It could take months. 
It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with, and to remember what you have learned. 
You can also start to change what you build. 
But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, "I won." 
We should be doing something about it. 
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. 
So how do you know if your breasts are dense? 
So, this is from "2nd Sight," a book I did on intuition. 
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs, I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time. 
As you can see, they meet in 2030, I’ll be retired by then. 
And do you remember the response? 
So, I decided to investigate. 
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal." 
It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. 
And it is something which has several characteristics. 
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. 
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things, this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him, "How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is." 
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it. 
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. 
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all. 
It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave. 
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective. 
So in my work, I hear that life is hard, relationships are filled with risk. 
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded. 
At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies' behavior in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition. 
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term. 
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses from the Innocence Project work, where we know that we have, what, 250, 280 documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated, some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis, and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them. 
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent, I want some sites to understand my habits. 
It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. 
AK: And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden. 
And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off, and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. 
So this is a very early prototype. 
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal. 
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting. 
Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells, electricity and advanced biofuels. 
But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen." 
And here's a couple of maps that we've done. 
We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living. 
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost. 
This data was not available before. 
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston. 
And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers. 
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race, three times around the world. 
And, of equal importance is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere, at 100,000 feet, which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. 
(Applause) Thank you. I have two missions here today. 
There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. 
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year. 
So that's, to me, a way forward. 
Their billboards are manuals, prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures. 
And I was stuck, because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. 
Now if I graph, for instance, some other technology, say transportation technology, on a semi-log curve, it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line. 
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia, or Mongolia, or North Korea, though that's not very popular. 
Now, those are much better than what a novice like I could do, but they're still jerky and imprecise. 
We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. 
After all, aging is not a piece of cake. 
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children? 
How many of you have kids? 
Right? Great, hang up, flourish, go home. 
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't. 
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money. 
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair. 
(Laughter) "The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week, Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. 
So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities. 
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa. 
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?" 
Now check this out. 
You measure their happiness at the end of the day, those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves. 
Here is what we see coming. 
And not just individual machines, but fleets of locomotives, airplanes, entire systems like power grids, hospitals. 
It's not just reality; it's feeling and reality. 
It's amazing. 
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. 
You can use it at TED. 
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive, so very few will be able to basically afford that. 
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth. 
Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born. 
So I learned that lesson at a young age. 
Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. 
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes. 
Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing. 
This whole thing is about four feet wide, and the chair itself is only about a few inches. 
That's what it's shrunk to. 
Think about it. 
And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century, that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, we didn't have an endangered people's movement. 
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. 
All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods, abdominal pressure, back pain, frequent urination. 
You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken. 
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker. 
But we have to integrate that into our own future. 
How did he not know -- it's what we've all forgotten -- that we're not the first ones to build. 
This is playing with those filters. 
It was actually robotic surgery. 
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman. 
And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code. 
All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. 
That's the end. 
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. 
I could see vividly, I suppose, being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background, and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind. 
Thanks very much. 
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it. 
This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network. 
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians. 
We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. 
What defines a story? 
And then they also exhibit curiosity. 
And this was just eight months ago. 
This is where we need to mobilize Africans, in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this. 
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for, you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services. 
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand. 
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her. 
So, we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative: their over-competitiveness, their, you know, long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it. 
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring, which is a little organization we started to promote, to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics. 
So this is really exciting for us, because now we have a portal, a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation, so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand. 
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. 
And surgeons were tradesmen, rather than physicians. 
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. 
It would be unconscionable for us to, in an intentional and deliberate way, set about executing people." 
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. 
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news? 
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way. 
These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. 
And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist. 
This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along: "Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address. 
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing. 
So, in soap, fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent, but also for giving it a pearl-like effect. 
It's more difficult. 
Our drinking water safe we make. 
We've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years. 
(Sister: 16.) CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed. 
And I heard the same story again and again, a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. 
Because it is hard to make symmetry. 
50th percentile female frame. 
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. 
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined. 
"What should you not be? 
I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect, and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!" 
One's got to build a lot of technology. 
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people, called a human-powered computer. 
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. 
But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model. 
Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between. 
And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. 
We humans are inventing a new fire, not dug from below, but flowing from above; not scarce, but bountiful; not local, but everywhere; not transient, but permanent; not costly, but free. 
In short, what all of us do. 
I learned that our own inner worlds -- our ideas, emotions and imaginations -- were, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies. 
I see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away. 
That's called the Powell Doctrine. 
It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red. 
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon. 
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. 
One, two, three, four, five, six and seven. 
Shall we see?

So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario. 
I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? 
So a colleague of mine at Berkley, he and I were looking at Triceratops. 
(Laughter) It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed -- there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia, there are only so many families of children who are transgender, there are only so many families of prodigies -- who also face similar challenges in many ways -- there are only so many families in each of those categories -- but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing, then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon. 
It's not a system. 
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves? 
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio. 
What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. 
I'm a woman who loves getting texts who's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem. 
Something like Rule 30, for example, turns out to be a really good randomness generator. 
Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables. 
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives. 
It's what he's basically talking about in those 18 and a half minutes. 
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore. 
I don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age. 
But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the United States. 
And it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God. 
And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative -- and this is all played anonymously. 
Now what happened was, in February 2008, Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with saliva. 
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. 
If you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers, you dry it and then you freeze it. 
You're having to imagine it. 
You've gotta sell something. 
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon, but in life itself. 
It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article -- where, the time, the website. 
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things, while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. 
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"? 
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. 
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there. 
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use. 
We think of our future as anticipated memories. 
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community. 
Thank you. 
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. 
Gravity wins over all other known forces. 
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out, but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing. 
So we asked those guys to do it again. 
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking -- we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?" 
In fact, imagine something even worse. 
But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. 
This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally, thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation. 
It's waterproof. 
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary, it will already be well out of date. 
You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. 
But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs? 
Our generosity, our altruism, our compassion, are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. 
Thanks. 
It gives them structure. 
Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing, and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out. 
When you look at this orb web, you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. 
I don't know why I sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died. 
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it? 
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with, we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away? 
It's between buildings. 
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. 
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs. 
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. 
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart. 
For Africa to truly be sustainable, we have to move beyond to other industries. 
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically. 
This is the landscape of one medicine. 
The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars. 
I can see his hands reaching out, and I can see his face in terror, looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad." 
And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent, you might be interested to know that social mobility, one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States, is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets. 
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. 
So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels. 
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. 
If they equal your feelings, you don't even know you have a model. 
And when I sat down next to him, he was telling me about a company he formed, and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. 
But the reality is our users, our customers, they do different things. They sit cross-legged more. 
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin. 
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion, because -- a natural curiosity. 
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine. 
I think we see the war like a game -- like soccer, football. 
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology. 
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. 
Literature makes one sensitive, sensitive to people, to their dreams and to their ideas." 
But there is another world. 
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. 
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it. 
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low: 40 or 50 years in a lot of places. 
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time. 
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires? 
The converse is also true. 
And here's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained, I said, "Jim, it's time now. 
I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie, and I'd ship my film to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later, it would end up on my front door, which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood. (Music) I didn't have much money, but I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music) So I started shooting time-lapse photography. 
OK. 
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here; I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world. 
What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words. 
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along. 
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past. 
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits, we can have both. 
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. 
And how might that change their lives? 
Opportunities are unequally distributed. 
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter) And we were very, very happy. 
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance, I think. 
And I also was taught, coupled with that, that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job, apparently, to help. 
So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. 
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. 
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that. 
If you don't know it, it's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that, it's got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit. 
And if you know anything about rural India, you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do. 
And what I normally do is walk 'round a room -- (Laughter) -- trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope. 
Toilet facilities: very bad. 
So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up, that already have this effect. 
He was with our transportation team. 
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse. 
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel. 
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 
Let's look at it. Let's look into it. 
But what I've been doing -- when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house. 
Have you ever had any diseases? 
If you did this, more people would save more. 
But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements. 
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. 
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. 
Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. 
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion. 
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. 
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers. 
Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like, because it's preserved, and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size, because they can articulate speech, and then mix them? 
And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch. 
Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years, but only for organizations at the top of the economy. 
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. 
Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this. 
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom, and this is what it looks like in my classroom. 
Your country talks about democracy, but you support corrupt governments like my own. 
The results have been fantastic. 
It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs. 
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. 
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between. 
We really should clean that up. 
No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth. 
I heard him come in. 
Now importantly, these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells. 
And as these dark clouds were circling me, and I was finding it really, really difficult to think of anything good, I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. 
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale." 
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50. 
And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. 
Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures." 
And my heroine here -- like Satish's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. 
And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them, so I just did it anyway. 
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class. 
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception. 
Other designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa. 
I said that, "We are going to win. 
There's an opportunity here, and it's real. 
All of them interact with one another. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here, and I'm sure you all recognize the results. 
That's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. 
You've overestimated. 
(Laughter) What matters is what we mean by those symbols. 
Wealth piles up in the wrong places. 
But what are your fish eating? 
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye: bacteria and grains of sand. 
He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire. 
Even more so than George Orwell, the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley. 
(Applause) I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. 
Well, in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood, and look underneath and see what's going on. 
Animation and art has always been my first love. 
It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. 
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it. 
And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service, his system was called NLS for oN-Line System. 
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. 
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. 
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable, independent role in society. 
All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank, and no water is wasted. 
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea. 
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. 
I don't mean any criminal act. 
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture. 
Now we have three years to do something else. 
(Laughter) You try them all in order: Mmm...? 
This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian, and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. 
But I still think that this -- (Laughter) -- may be this year's version of this. 
And he pairs these up with paintings. 
In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. 
Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass. 
We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car. 
And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind. 
Twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. 
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton. 
In that clinic, even today, there are two social workers for 24,000 pediatric patients, which is better than a lot of the clinics out there. 
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. 
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business, value to the users also, but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. 
And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society, the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one. 
Consumer applications for genomics, they will flourish. 
With no elevators, the tower is like a 45-story walkup. 
For me, "Law and Order: SVU," Tine Fey and "30 Rock" and "Judge Judy" -- "The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final." 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) BF: No, come stay up with him. 
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient. 
So now we can breathe safely. 
And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because then, where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music? 
All this stuff that happens around. 
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast. 
And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here. 
Now there's often no right or wrong here. 
We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever. 
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing. 
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on. 
And these organizers, they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other. 
This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments, showing that children, in the right conditions, can learn on their own with the help of computers. 
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. 
Oh yeah. So, clever thing. 
This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need, the opportunity; they didn't have the incentive to innovate. 
When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily -- things like grades, SAT's, degrees, the number of years in schooling. 
And essentially, the story is this with right whales, that about a million years ago, there was one species of right whale on the planet, but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated, the species sort of separated, and today we have essentially two distinct stocks. 
Pain is something that can make your life miserable. 
Or Putin. Or any national leader. 
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. 
In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. 
So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity. 
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. 
And I remember the first letter. 
So, what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's -- maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera, which is cricket. 
Her text said, "Mom, you will rock." 
But there's a middle ground, too. 
Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork. 
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors. 
Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990s happened. 
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left. 
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we'll see that right there, it says, "Welcome to the dungeon." 
I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable. 
Cisco actually estimates that, within four years, more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video. 
And if we did that, then Google would back this. 
All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS. 
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books, and they're called A, B and C. 
But, using the language of Galois, we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. 
Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room, I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. 
So this great triumph -- it's so good, there's almost a religious experience in biology. 
So even though China's is a totally censored Internet, but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming. 
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now, what has happened? 
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -- so the scientists are telling us. 
But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping. 
In the United States, there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. 
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience. 
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't. 
I think that's probably right, although this is a controversial issue. 
There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood and trying to make it move. 
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen. 
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology for the control and deployment of power. 
In the blink of an eye, we nearly doubled the length of time that we're living. 
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets, and weary, frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines. 
So you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers. 
And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea. 
And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- I wanted that, but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year. 
Most of them were about resources. 
This is a small house somewhere. 
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly. 
He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies. 
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped. 
So now we had a hangar space to work in, and prototypes to demo with. 
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. 
That's interesting to cosmologists. 
By the time I get to Australia, if I get to Australia, I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all. 
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important. 
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. 
This one is a "third lung," a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment. 
Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue. 
(Applause) I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery and how we might do post-conflict recovery better. 
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons. 
And here's how news shapes what Americans see. 
And the animal comes back for a food reward. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience, this community, to help you on your way and to do something on this issue. 
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. 
It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul. 
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected, will always be unexpected. 
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body." 
Kids don’t play all the time, obviously. 
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. 
In other words: structure. 
Another thing I do is I invent stuff. 
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake, you have to use one of our prefab images -- only for professionals." 
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried. 
(Applause) In tribute and remembrance of 26/11 attacks over the last one year, we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO, Aman Foundation, to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund. 
He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri. 
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. 
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?" 
But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today. 
And you have to do that. 
That was post-War Europe. 
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects. 
It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology; it's a time for tears. 
Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. 
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is. 
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars, why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses, put them on a podium of cars. 
The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward, that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -- cellphones, laptops, all these things that I had never seen before. 
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?" 
Probably not. 
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. 
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. 
Of course, in the challenge there is a prize. 
Well, with the pig, at the baseline, before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal. 
The good time is over when you think, how good is it? 
This is Alexander Lebed, who was a general that worked with Yeltsin, who talked about, and presented to Congress, this idea that the Russians had developed -- these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield -- 0.1 to one kiloton, Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons -- but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. 
And what we have here -- I am not saying so, this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so. 
So that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence. 
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars, averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that, because they have competing needs. 
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories. 
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce, you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. 
So it was always the satirist, like Juvenal or Martial, represented the audience, and he was going to make fun of the outsider, the person who didn't share that subject status. 
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted, friendly, very socially skillful people, and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships, make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter, you've got to use your personal skills, and that's the way politics has always worked. 
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments, or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments. 
And we know what's happened in the past, so if we start now, and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term, we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old, I'll be able to say that it's been a success. 
And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming. 
A: Oh no, we're just staging, ROD: We're just staging it. 
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday. 
"We are going to win because we don't understand politics. 
It's kind of easy to patronize the past, to forego our responsibilities in the present. 
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us, but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature, keyboards that roll up, and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch. 
Now, if you were to go down to, say, 300 feet, you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs -- you've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs. 
Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world, and those gay people have to discover identity later on. 
Currently the leader is Germany. 
If it does represent language, then how do we read the symbols? 
DH: We will juggle seven. 
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. 
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically. 
Pretty straightforward really. 
(Laughter) It's fairly self-explanatory. 
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it. 
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world, just by a click of the button. 
You can make multiple subjects. 
They both have that kind of up-sweep. 
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy. 
That's why I became a doctor. 
What is she writing? 
(Applause) I'd like to start with a short story. 
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do. 
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom, and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here. 
The specter of mass starvation loomed. 
Well that's just a matter of mindset. 
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK? 
Over the past seven years, I've been following my fascination with the built environment, and for those of you who know me, you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase 365 days a year. 
Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, "Well actually, this is hard to grasp," because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. 
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them. 
We have eight engines in this vehicle. 
We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions. 
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. 
Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. 
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups. 
I think it was a tactic of survival. 
(Laughter) Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks. 
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s. 
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. 
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. 
(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden. 
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite. 
We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels -- you probably meet, too -- who want to join up, in some way, and reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked. 
The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders, clustering into a kind of a tan. 
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. 
I may be an [odd] student with unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you. 
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here, because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational. 
Or will the biosphere stabilize? 
I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. 
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall. 
And it turns out that as we discover these things, we human beings really like to change how we look, how we act, what our bodies do. 
And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these, because I'm setting up lights, and checking my lights, and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent. 
So for 2009, I'm training hard for my two new projects. 
Hey, we live in a very noxious world. 
So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. 
And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister." 
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. 
So that's where a headrest comes in. 
How do we take their contributions to their jobs, their communities and their families, and convert that value into reputation capital? 
If you look at the chart at the top here, you'll see that in 2025, these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. 
The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning. 
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night. 
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. 
She never raised her voice. 
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her. 
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface, we did a stem cell paste graft, which we designed in 1991, to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there. 
I was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. 
Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro. 
Now this is a plant. 
Seven nations are involved in building this. 
Right? 
Feasting? I was totally confused. 
After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing -- because, after all, that's really what this is about -- we moved to the second phase of our work, where we interviewed adult experts in academia, some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. 
Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly, like this one, the recent Icelandic volcano. 
And what do you do with this food? You cook it! 
So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry. 
It's become, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe." 
I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body. 
And the main players are over 35, and are female. 
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous. 
If we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision. 
All the fences at Green School are green. 
Today, when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric, we're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable Middle Eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself. 
So you've got an interface that has no interface. 
So, literally two weeks ago, I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life. 
Academia says no. 
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. 
It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide; the people did. 
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves. 
And it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. 
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer, and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that. 
Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself. 
Nerves are yellow, arteries are red, veins are blue. 
And when it became a landscape, it also became a destination, and altered, really, the course of my life. 
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. 
I started reading Popular Science magazine, and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis. 
There's lots of room, so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved. 
Oh, that's all my time? 
Let's look at art now. 
We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this." 
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water. 
It's really just been basic demographics. 
They are very important to how we communicate with each other. 
And we're going to do it. 
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California. 
So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories. 
He said, "Be happy. 
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. 
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. 
She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. 
So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts. 
Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, so we're talking about five percent, at most, of our time as a modern, distinct species. 
However, they return to baseline a lot sooner. 
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. 
And these systems are being tested right now, and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. 
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. 
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things, and my brain had taken the suggestion. 
So, he didn't really want to say anything. 
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them." 
This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002, and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa, think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent. 
This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients. 
We have been mountains and apples and pulsars and other people's knees. 
And it's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has, because it's so fundamental to our lives. 
This is what we know for certain. 
Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. 
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality. 
The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter) BR: But it's not all just edible pictures. 
He would have loved those! Oh yeah. 
It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next -- which is a very, very difficult problem. 
Now of course, development doesn't end at five. 
This one in particular sticks in my mind, because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. 
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough. 
The nuclear envelope breaks down. 
(Laughter) I was afraid to talk to my new boss, but decided to muster up my courage. 
So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes. 
They were key in our culture and our economy. 
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. 
When I first went in, I was scared, because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs. 
Well, there are three main reasons why we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves: The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do, and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area, even if it's small. 
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort, and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight, Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. 
What you can assist us, it's by building capacities. 
And it was a revelation. 
So, we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her. 
There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. 
The other is power diffusion, the way power is moving from all states West or East to non-state actors. 
In fact, they have hackers writing them. 
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on, and that we're not aware of them? 
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century, it started to take on this other kind of deception -- this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with, an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. 
I told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon, and we'll do it by the end of the decade. 
You really do have to go and see his latest film, "Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible. 
You know, just at the beginning of this year, at the turn of the new year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012. 
So, what can we synthesize out of all this? 
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. 
I'm doing something serious. 
One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here. 
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design, and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make -- you can always get three out of four of anything you want; the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality -- I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids, because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm. 
In fact, on all these discs there were documents. 
They are supposed to be locked up. 
And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body. 
♫ La li la la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ Oh, I want to thank you for so many gifts ♫ ♫ You gave in love with tenderness ♫ ♫ Thank you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you for your generosity ♫ ♫ the love and the honesty that you gave me ♫ ♫ I want to thank you show my gratitude, ♫ My love and my respect for you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you, thank you ♫ 
(Laughter) I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. 
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions. 
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. 
Later that year, an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee. 
Journalists, this is off the record; it's embargoed. 
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion -- priming God, making people think about God -- often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior. 
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it. 
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide, and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them -- but we can also detect their presence in the past. 
It's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there, and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that. 
For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. 
The reason for this is incentives. 
You put a little sticky tape. 
So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s -- slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas. 
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church. 
So I want you to look at the person beside you. 
Being human is an art form. 
But it was too late for Sergio. 
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim. 
They're storing it, they're processing it. 
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage. 
They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full-stop. 
They have more things going on in them. 
They do amazing stuff with silicon. 
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers. 
In 1975, Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University. 
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule." 
But we've worked through some of those, but we've still got real problems in Washington. 
They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness. 
You can also do this with solar cells. 
As a nation, no we're not. 
Obviously a very small community. 
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule. 
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. 
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry. 
So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands, we have combined these functions. 
And see now, we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings, but we often don't have so much material. 
Almost nothing has changed. 
The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. 
They have similar sound of eyes. 
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. 
Well, some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing. 
So T is F. 
Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality? 
Well, there's also another program, in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration. 
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. 
In truth, liberal arts education no longer exists -- at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country. 
And I'll tell you why. 
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere, the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal, perfect realm, where lives God, who is the ultimate judge of everything. 
That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. 
And this is actually a very brief clip -- only about 30 seconds -- of a patient who actually received an organ. 
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. 
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK? 
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like. 
All that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems. 
What's in that information? 
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever. 
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry. 
A German prison camp. 
They took the DNA from that ear, they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat, the pregnancy came to term, and a live baby bucardo was born. 
So, in a way, because the Chinese were attacked, chop suey was created as a defense mechanism. 
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on. 
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. 
(Applause) My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. 
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life, would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton. 
I went to prison -- difficult. 
And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life" from the bookstore here at TED. 
You can also interact with your X-ray, and also if you want, you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray, too. 
Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. 
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur. 
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska. 
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built, so they brought us in to intercede. 
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that. 
But what's interesting about that suggestion was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds; it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure; it would actually cost about 50 quid. 
By his own writing, this man was either asleep, at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase. 
And a lot of people can't even afford them. 
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas]. 
I envision a 36-story, 450-unit residential high-rise -- a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission. 
I was going to work with small farmers. 
On their way, they looted everything. 
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm. 
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization. 
So again, it's not just genes, it's multiple details -- our habits, our environmental exposure. 
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes. 
So, thank you. 
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson. 
And we need to be working with these students. 
And this is in Takaungu -- we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made. 
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. 
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. 
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive, opposed to conclusive when you are advertising. 
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater. 
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology. 
(Applause) PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think -- I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light. 
If you could please stand up, [unclear]. 
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding." 
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing. 
These are very, very small beginnings, and actually there's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they're not even on this map. 
They’re powerful tools for transformation, for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy, to be peaceful, to be joyful and to realize that it’s not something that you pursue and get, but rather it’s something that you have already until you disturb it. 
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school, and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks, and I decided to go traveling. 
But it paid the bills. 
Today, I see Kibera in a different way. 
(Laughter) And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know? 
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?" 
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome? 
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness But that's so unfair. 
And she put her head back and she said, "It feels like leaping into heaven." 
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. 
And you know, the amount of work -- yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris, and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. 
And then there's this guy, okay. 
50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy. 
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now. 
There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that. 
By 2008, Country A has surpassed Country B with $700 per capita GDP as compared with $650 per capita GDP. 
They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood. 
About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time. 
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida. 
'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you. 
Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure. 
But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction, and it's the Internet helping it along. 
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. 
So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems. 
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place. 
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels. 
And I forgot to bring one up with me. 
It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle. 
They never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan. 
We need it for our everyday life, in order to make the world a smaller place. 
I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives. 
Politicians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that certain things that voters want, certain things that voters have been promised, may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver. 
And in times of revolution or change like today, it is very important for independent media to have a voice. 
I could barely breathe. 
Which is why I'll show you a threat, and an architectural response. 
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly, we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. 
Peals of merry laughter! 
Keep that in mind. 
So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. 
We want to say, "This is just the way it is. 
In 2003, we published our first success. 
And my story, my personal story, is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here. 
I think that's very, very important. 
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be -- CA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron? 
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it. 
We are policing the world, and how are we doing that? 
But we’re not actually doing it by astrology. 
We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson, to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. 
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. 
(Applause) Four years ago today, exactly, actually, I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. 
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in. 
A: Cutting hair? Never, never. 
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. 
So thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. 
A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -- the cost of loss of topsoil, the cost of loss of waterways, the lost productivity, the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors, desertification and so on -- those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. 
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. 
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures, they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. 
But that ability to make progress remained almost unused, until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe. 
On another subject -- (Laughter) -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design." 
And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head -- not through headphones, in my own head -- of 65 songs. 
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. 
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit, but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the Creative Commons, which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. 
Yeah, this is she. 
And what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less. 
And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. 
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform, to totally rethink fundraising. 
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from. 
And it's all about international writing systems. 
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. 
(Applause) Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun. 
Six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured. 
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant, you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub-critical setting, basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. 
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. 
And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone. 
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future, and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. 
By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton. 
I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said, and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth. 
And so my house came down, I received my first patent against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants. 
So she says, "Absolutely not. 
Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. 
Cast it in bronze." 
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter) MM: I should leap in. 
Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in. 
And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature, it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment. 
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture, and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference? 
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. 
This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury, but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life. 
It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that. 
(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. 
These organisms can be totally desiccated; they can live in a vacuum. 
I know that we can, and as far as I'm concerned, that's something the world needs right now. 
You know the one. 
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. 
These countries have six children per woman. 
We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going. 
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX, high resolution, future generation spectrograph for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope. 
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this, and they tried to suppress it, but what they hadn't counted on was technology, and then they had the printing press, which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast, and people would come together in coffee houses, discuss the ideas, plot revolution. 
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies. 
So that's the focus on the construction sector. 
And Moi is 35 years old. 
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio, "There's never a wrong time to do the right thing." 
(Applause) I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender. 
It's more makers. 
All the others have been all those three. 
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion. 
I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me." 
They said, "You know, when do you want to come out?" 
And just by using cold water going through the water pipes, you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium, so you can create that comfort, and then by adding dry air instead of down-chilled air, the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs, to their individual energy balance. 
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. 
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. 
We're curious, and we just go out and get knowledge, you know? 
And in discovery phase, we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring. 
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist. 
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared. 
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water. 
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house. 
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. 
And they all treat learning, not as some sort of academic, analytical activity, but as that's something that's productive, something you make, something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from. 
I’d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. 
53 countries, and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. 
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment. 
The FAA, the controlling body above all, calls it a "powered lift aircraft." 
So I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan. 
One good thing did come out of it. 
The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning. 
And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used, but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing. 
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet. 
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. 
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together, as is Lithuania. When we start to see power over the core functions of government — spending, legislation, decision-making — then we're well on our way to an open government revolution. 
So in that case, I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away, or strip, those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. 
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. 
Two big things happened: First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe; and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language. 
Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it. 
(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 
Let's look at that ant. 
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. 
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes." 
(Laughter) So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles: "And the environment is so important, all we can do. 
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor. 
And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it, invited by politicians, invited in energy forums, in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies. 
And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world. 
I was sent straight away to my school principal, and my school principal, a sweet nun, looked at my book with disgust, flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes -- you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her -- and the nun slapped me on my face and said, "Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun." 
And just like that, you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. 
Design, the art of organizing the world of things. 
By then we had two grandchildren, Sophie and Connor. 
He wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there. 
If you look at the scene, Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill. 
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. 
It's not better public transportation. 
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said. 
But to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. 
(Laughter) It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. 
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine, one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death. 
So, what is the social result of this? 
Where's the line that marks that? 
Hopefully it won't stutter. 
All across the boreal, it's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples, and a rich and varied culture. 
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it: "progress." 
(Laughter) As soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away. 
He wanted a bigger band. 
And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator, the grandmother started crying. 
Do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it? 
And I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me. 
I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we're at and where we're going. 
And what I'm talking about is this. 
So when I say full, I mean really full -- well past any margin for error, well past any dispute about methodology. 
And the people thought for themselves, "Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario." 
And where were they heading? 
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too. 
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter) Now -- (Applause) -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. 
And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever? 
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. 
Some people would make apple pie out of it. 
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. 
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer." 
Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com. 
The act of observation changes it. 
And let's think about urban living, not today, and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years? 
They come with their own ideas and their own theories, and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them, right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates, either. 
The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals, but even when they do talk about important political issues, they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. 
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page, but not if you look at the monitor as a window. 
(Laughter) There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. 
So we put patients with these subjects under the UV, and their NO levels do go up, and their blood pressure goes down. 
So designers work on this particular malaise that we have, these kinds of discomforts that we have, and try to make life easier for us. 
And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list. 
Now, as mentioned before, one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case. 
They understood more than we did people's innate need to be connected. 
Thank you. 
Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer, and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor, who is a veteran of National Geographic, and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun." 
"Yes, I suffered." 
And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. 
These are two that I strongly recommend, and they list a whole bunch of reforms. 
Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire. 
First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket -- (Laughter) and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in. 
Well I don't think that. 
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment. 
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic, otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City. 
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m. 
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task. 
They come to us with a request for a loan. 
But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts, like cars and aerospace and so on. 
It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts. 
Journalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester. 
Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American. 
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation. 
That's very obvious, we all know that. 
Look in your heart, actually. 
In English, fear is something we conquer. 
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it. 
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. 
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. 
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it. 
These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. 
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science, what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs? 
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything? 
I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. 
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car. 
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. 
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk. 
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. 
And that's BumpTop. Thanks! 
Here's an example from Hong Kong, where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor, so the light sensor detects the hole in the board, so as they move the physical saw, the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. 
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff. 
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything? 
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey. 
It was never him. 
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be, I would've probably said, a couple of percent. 
And what it is -- it's a twist on health. 
Many people are Tweeting right now. 
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. 
So she took it. 
However, anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. 
So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder, a data tag, in the appliance plug. 
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets, you have to do this job. 
And that's all we seem to be caring about recently. 
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body. 
Hot air rises. 
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well. 
And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force. 
On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves, a good friend, a stakeholder, who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues, a stakeholder who refuses to compromise -- planet Earth. 
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here, and they were using the Internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims. 
We call this crustal magnetism. 
People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me. 
They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. 
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which, in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud -- these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system, but they are biologically very interesting indeed, because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals, which are just the right ones for developing life. 
She said, "Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world." 
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it, they were telling exactly the truth. 
They told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star. 
So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. 
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. 
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. 
It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man, one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. 
They had met the great man; they had been instructed by the great man; they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud, and it was something special. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. 
Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things. 
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong, but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit. 
"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds, but it was worth it." 
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people. 
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned? 
If those people had voted for Obama, even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely. 
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. 
So this was a debugging, problem-solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there. 
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s. 
I don't think Apophis is a problem. 
The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action. 
This process is a very calculated process. 
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. 
And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. 
So what happens when a person puts this thing on? 
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses. 
This? It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon, the falls, and that's what I love the most about it. 
But I'm doing it now, and I'm going to tell you about it. 
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. 
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. 
So, for example, most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. 
Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing. 
They were dressed to the nines. 
Who makes a great interview in this context? 
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look. 
This is the market leader in malware distribution, the Black Hole Exploit Pack, responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters. 
There's really no dispute about progress, if we discount the cost of that. 
(Laughter) The United States has been an idea leader. 
It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up, inflation is affected. 
A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came] tenrecs, accustomed to the dark. 
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold. 
That's what Europe and North America represented. 
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. 
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. 
Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side -- bringing peace to Northern Ireland. 
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way, and it's almost impossible to do it on computers. 
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. 
Now I want to take you into the caldera. 
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia. 
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes, and those microbes actually do us good much of the time, rather than killing us. 
Thanks, Chris. 
Until midnight, he'd be thinking. 
That's why, two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. 
But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset, which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience, acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole, and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. 
Every problem that's out there, somebody has the idea for. 
Saul has the same expectation. 
Instead of trying to purge these comments, they instead went and reached out to the bloggers. 
Thank you. 
And with that, he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases. 
And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas, to work with lemon shark pups. 
But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet, and the router card was down. 
One is that the aliens might be very far away. 
What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy, which is really quite important. 
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session, and from all the different presenters. 
But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology, called the alphabet, and writing, we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture. 
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference? 
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls, and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern, and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls, which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. 
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends. 
We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off. 
Now, not all of us have meadows, or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course, grow a meadow in a pot. 
(Laughter) Because we had different models based on our different experiences. 
That's all we're doing here. 
She herself was suffering from HIV; she was suffering from tuberculosis. 
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot, where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters, and we are tracking them. 
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. 
When we create the right kind of identity, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense. 
RS: I'm not. 
This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way. 
We're heading to the future of bits, where everything is speedy, it's weightless. 
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house." 
And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. 
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries, as have our preferences for them. 
What intrigues me most is how women are doing this, despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating. 
This was actually just taken last year. 
Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things, and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things, comparisons become important. 
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals, fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there's your pea soup. 
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder, I think this is a great way of doing it. 
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu -- some of you call it bird flu -- which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s, but we didn't know about it until 1997. 
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are. 
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. 
They were responding to immediate concerns. 
And so those tumors, those are symptoms of cancer. 
He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious. 
The cash for good grades has had very mixed results, for the most part has not resulted in higher grades. 
Across northern Europe, many governments now have innovation laboratories within them. 
The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note. 
But these are things that we can see. 
You know, I'd never lost anything, like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know, I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first. 
There were 3,500 people, the Veteran's Administration, U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event to help the families of all the kids -- some that have died, some that are like Brandon -- and they wanted me to speak. 
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality. 
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too. 
And that's just to start. 
The next is self-assembly, because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. 
And that's why he moved to Michigan. 
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring. 
The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer." 
back when it was the ARPANET, there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it. 
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. 
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion. 
One of the questions we've confronted is, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward? 
Audience: No. 
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. 
It says that, if it were linear, the steepest slope, then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy. 
(Music) (Applause) Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion, which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked, but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened. 
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. 
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. 
(Laughter) When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it, he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print. 
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing. 
So privatization is one of the things we've done. 
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. 
And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse; I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web, that have been extraordinarily innovative; I've gone back to the history of the first cities; I've even gone to biological environments, like coral reefs and rainforests, that involve unusual levels of biological innovation; and what I've been looking for is shared patterns, kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. 
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down. 
What we look for in firemen, in climbers, in policemen, and what we should look for in intervention, is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff, not people who jump into a burning room, but who weigh their risks, weigh their responsibilities. 
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst. 
My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have. 
And I am convinced. 
There are 146 top players in the core, and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the TNCs' value. 
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things, that you'll see a lot more of. 
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south. 
This is me being a rock star, even if it's in my own house. 
But beyond the staggering numbers, what's truly important from a global health point of view, what's truly worrying from a global health point of view, is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives, and remember, we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions, medicines, psychological interventions, and social interventions, can make a vast difference. 
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. 
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars, if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth. 
But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter) we've taken a very different approach. 
(Laughter) This trait also tells us a lot about politics. 
And none of those problems could I have dealt with, but I have a really bright research team. 
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively. 
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes. 
Well, Egypt is a good starting point. 
So, visualizing information, so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense, or it tells a story, or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. 
That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. 
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it. 
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine? 
Then I found out, post exposure, that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff, that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water. 
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. 
So that's one way of going about it. 
What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective. 
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control. 
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls. 
Asthma: large number, we could detect things like pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer, I'll show you an example of that real quickly. 
A kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent. 
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. 
Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. 
That's not timely. 
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. 
I'm putting the data together now, and at some point -- there will always be magic to love, but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background, your same general level of intelligence, your same general level of good looks, and you don't feel pulled towards all of them. 
My final story is about a young, beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga, who was another Acumen Fund fellow, who hails from Uganda, a farming community. 
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. 
And I thought it was worth a chance, he thought it was worth a chance, and so we got up on the stage, and we had an hour conversation about his life, and after that a woman rushed up to me, essentially did, and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?" 
In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood. 
And in some ways, the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly. 
And the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars, and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets, and the informed player's going to get the rest. 
And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that, in fact, we were losing natural capital -- the benefits that flow from nature to us. 
But you can create your own feedback loop. 
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. 
But it was true, and basically, of those 110 people, and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie. 
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. 
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it. 
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit. 
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely, but for the sake of the oceans, we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions as soon as possible. 
I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. 
And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. 
And it forms these towers, these chimneys that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall. 
So, back to Mars. 
But when I looked down, I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up, so I got going on it. 
And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life-regulation devices of the body. 
And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. 
So how do you move these people around? 
Last slide. 
From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war. 
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. 
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? 
Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint? 
Now we have to create the G20. 
He's dying. 
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s. 
I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet. 
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color. 
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water, and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree, sometimes even having to route around an obstacle, but to get that nutrition flowing. 
(Laughter) "China seems to have been long stationary, and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. 
And the framework is a memory framework, not a computation or behavior framework. It's a memory framework. 
Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing into what they can't do, helps them focus on finding their own voice. 
And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. 
But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see, at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly. 
We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self. 
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers. 
We have 30 species of reptiles. 
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. 
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents. 
(Music) Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. 
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot? 
An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana, and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach. 
That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. 
And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room. 
Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court himself the next day. He won the ruling, but later that very evening, he fell, and he died. 
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head. 
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding. 
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules are being developed, but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. 
This is why it matters to the military. 
(Laughter) There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. 
So can we have that second? 
And this explanation represents great progress. 
Rupal Patel: That was the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking. 
Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. 
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one. 
All of these things. 
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. 
Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface, I show what's within. 
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also. 
Now, the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. 
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars? 
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being. 
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. 
CP: That's a good question. 
So inertia versus momentum. 
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. 
And I think that is really the nature of architecture. 
Thanks a lot. 
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture. 
So I write software. And that's how I do it. 
And it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth. 
So let me show the wider picture. 
The more we keep on using the oil, particularly the imported oil, the more we face a very obvious array of problems. 
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators. 
Side street in Italy. 
And we continued. 
We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born. 
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. 
So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future. 
And so we should. 
It happened twice more on the honeymoon. 
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall. 
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging. 
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge" in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete. 
You go on to the next scan, but, in Beck's case, you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. 
Derek's going to L.A. soon, and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together, which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek? 
But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we? 
Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. 
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet. 
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your environment, and you print your own personal medicine. 
And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. 
We have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries. 
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that? 
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents. 
And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong. 
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it. 
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef? 
So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long, and I feel like I should stop here. 
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research, but they also encouraged thinking outside the box, rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question. 
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated. 
It's much like on a jet. 
What about the problem of picking up a chess piece, dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board? 
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used words like "limitation," "fear," "pity" and "restriction." 
They work through interaction -- they create a capability, and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage. 
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense, in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion. 
(Applause) Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time? 
So these are not particularly intelligent creatures, and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets. 
Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now, sharing their stories as data. 
(Laughter) Look -- (Laughter) These genomes, these 23 chromosomes, they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet. 
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry." 
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it." 
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers, I began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs. 
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. 
[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be, they're going to be selectively transparent. 
And a colleague of mine sent me this one from London. 
We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me. 
Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. 
The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice. 
These are rhetorical. 
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish. 
And I said, well, that's fine; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book, and he finally agreed to it. 
Second doctor: We're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.First doctor: Well, do you want to sit up? That's fine. 
Anybody? Nobody. 
And instead of sharing money, they become selfish. 
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. 
I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion. 
I was lost. 
By simply blocking all reuse, you'll miss out on new art forms, new audiences, new distribution channels and new revenue streams. 
Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know. 
So think about that. 
All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together. 
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out, because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. 
Thanks. 
Penguins are very vocal birds and really, really noisy. 
He said they were wrong. 
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health. 
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common. 
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle. 
That's a bad day at the office. 
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things? 
So it's a very different design. However, what's changing, what's really exciting -- and I'll show you some of that next -- is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. 
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. 
Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks recently and used the wireless network. 
On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. 
It's going to be much more complicated than that. 
What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. 
You dunk it in the river. 
And unbelievably, in 40 years, I was the first Indian to be honored. 
Now by noise, I do not mean sound. 
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars. 
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry. 
Know that China believes in the market and the state. 
Stay tuned for that. 
And at the time I didn't think much about it, but then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education. 
I had an awareness of being in my body, but also being out of my body, somewhere else, watching from above as if it was happening to someone else. 
And we need that relationship to reflect, to reclaim hope. 
But in fact, the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark, and then they sail empty back. 
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that. 
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads, shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks. 
Three trees together, we create the forest. 
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to. 
And this is my scariest. (Laughter) I don't have a good answer for this one. 
(Laughter) So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg. 
And then it was onto the saucer. 
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor. 
It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries, who were worried that revolution would spread. 
When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French, and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying. 
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. 
I have been changed with my children. 
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time, as they might confuse you or challenge you. 
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. 
MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat. 
(Applause) So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. 
It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. 
It is an easy answer. 
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair, and he's showing his machine. 
So, absolute figures, like the military budget, in a connected world, don't give you the whole picture. 
(Applause) (Applause) (Applause) I am a papercutter. 
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying. 
Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index, what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index." 
This is one of our engineers. 
Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum -- you know what I'm talking about -- not maybe full bipolar, but they're in the bipolar spectrum -- where on one side, maybe you think you're Jesus, and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money. 
So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power. 
But over a five- to 10-year period, we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. 
And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. 
If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy, and in our government policies. 
How much money can I save? 
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis, saying that, could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH? 
This is a stream. 
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. 
What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. 
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court. 
And their actions are fantastic. 
Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. 
I usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?" 
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source, pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production. 
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device. 
Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off. 
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly. 
We are going to merge with our technology. 
Why do we have this image? 
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate, and underneath that plate, there is a magnet. 
Very few things are very smooth. 
(Laughter) There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. 
And then somebody, I think it was BMW, introduced a light that went out slowly. 
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy. 
And I thought, "What am I thinking? 
Now, this is what I have described to you. 
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one, which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars. 
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes. 
How could you have a problem like this? 
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism, specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. 
Again, fairly more complex organs, but by far, the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized, a lot of blood vessel supply, organs such as the heart, the liver, the kidneys. 
White is the synthesis. 
Acting with intent. 
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years. 
(Applause) It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze. 
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again, and so no specimens have ever been collected. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And one of these principles is focus. 
It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex, and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. 
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time? 
It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things, including changing biology. 
The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer. 
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300. 
I am not a breast cancer survivor. 
So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow. 
(Laughter) But actually the power to re-brand things -- to understand that actually our experiences, costs, things don't actually much depend on what they really are, but on how we view them -- I genuinely think can't be overstated. 
He does the transportation and distribution, and she does the production and sourcing. 
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review. 
When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life, we think of compartmentalization, keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane, isolated from the rest of the environment, but yet, in an environment in which they actually could originate together. 
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous. 
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden: SEAL Team Six. 
Gorgeous assistant instructor. 
And when I think about that, first of all I think that government is a social contract between the people and the government, and if the government isn't transparent, then the people aren't going to be transparent either, but also that we're blaming the little guy who doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing that everyone's fudging things all over the world, including some extremely respected businesses, and I'll give you one example. 
They have an AIDS problem. I asked -- the U.S. State Department asked the government recently, What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems. 
(Laughter) That's the name of the show, they eat out, they -- that's on my tombstone when I die. 
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials. 
These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. 
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics. 
Mayors are where this is happening. 
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about. 
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name to say, "I exist." 
Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth, which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust, to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion. 
RSW: Why did you want that? 
Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. 
But I must say, the older I've gotten, the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man. 
But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing, the poor would always be with us. 
But in our land, in this land, in USA-land, there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there, many of them in this room here today, but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters, because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest. 
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up, you could make it interactive, zip code specific -- where people could join together, and through satellite imaging systems, through Virtual Earth or Google Earth, you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. 
And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. 
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy. 
I didn't make good grades in high school. 
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." 
(Applause) I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old. 
Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades? 
Many of them drown. 
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too. 
So since I tell stories, let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. 
Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds. 
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. 
They face a cruel situation of no choice. 
Not an easy project. 
And conversely, for every species or other entity or phenomenon, there exist important problems for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited. 
They are things that they have simply learned to do. 
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. 
And by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low. 
And he thought, "What if we do this?" 
The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. 
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. 
In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London, and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse, he had the idea for this. 
Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. 
Now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research. 
Unfortunately I couldn't go. 
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others, even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. 
Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities, but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it. 
When Connecticut adopted this system, in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only. 
That's a good number to go extinct, I think. 
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War." 
The public self, the beauty, the intellect, and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. 
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India." 
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question, and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this. 
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. 
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense, especially when the resources were free. 
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well. 
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect, and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh. 
Architects are actually really, really good at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking. 
When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say, "Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant? 
I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there. 
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. 
There's no other way to describe what's going on here. 
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer. 
You would literally hear the sound. 
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?" 
Ahhhh. 
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. 
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. 
And already today -- this is 25,000 images. 
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell. 
And this would be a hotel. 
So, it's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel. 
So this burden of knowledge drives me. 
(Laughter) And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols. 
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils. 
And many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they're never going to be able to afford the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built. 
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge. 
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center, and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. 
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them. 
That's not true at all. 
It was the young women, the health aids, who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. 
He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land. 
That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real-time image processing, and the device will say, "Up, down, left, right, ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor." 
More women's voices at the table? 
Now, it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. 
Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it: 1.2 million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod. 
For the sake of the planet we live on, for the sake of our children, for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us, we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats. 
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident? 
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be. 
I don't want to explain these things. 
Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. 
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors. 
And here is the most stunning number. 
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy. 
So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other, is if we can connect with each other. 
And four plus nine is 13, nine plus 25 is 34, and yes, the pattern continues. 
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui. 
And you can see how focused the surgeons are, how much concentration it takes. 
What is it that they're happy with? 
They understand what accountability and democracy is. 
1866: the beginning of the transcontinental railroad -- a new era. 
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. 
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. 
Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. 
And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up, so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers. 
In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same. 
What's in yours? 
I wish to go to school." 
(Applause) If you think about the phone -- and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you, over the last 10 years, in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland -- trying to understand: How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way? 
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?" 
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability. 
They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. 
Now that's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws, which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise. 
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off. 
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina, diseases like macular degeneration, and there's little that can be done for them. 
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. 
But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy. 
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. 
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing. 
The reason that it attracted so much attention, besides the fact that it's disgusting, is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die, and a farmer died of it, and you can imagine the scandal that happened. 
Now this is when something really bizarre happens. 
And I survive. 
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet, and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium. 
But there's a lot of technology going. 
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck." 
The people would become the defenders of that forest. 
(Applause). 
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard. 
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. 
Belief is natural; disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural. 
I can redeem this painting, just continuing on, doing layers upon layers. 
The shopkeepers are hiring more people. 
And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. 
So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. 
They did it by remote control. 
Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?) Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.) JN: Well this book has seven chapters, and the last chapter is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf." 
They travel down roads. 
So having seen this danger to the economy, I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem. 
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience. 
Camera. We have a picture right now. 
The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible. 
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks. They do. 
And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. 
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about. 
And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play. 
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination. 
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. 
Some abilities, of course, decrease with age. 
This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. 
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right. 
And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course, or very, very surprising. 
It was a lot of anger, insane humor, a lot of attention, outrage. 
Now go ahead and cut. 
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. 
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. 
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate. 
It was, remarkably, a pretty good sounding room. 
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos. 
It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation, or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty. 
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. 
(Applause) Very good! Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow? 
Now, this ability to put information into categories, I find a lot of people are not very good at this. 
We call it the Water Canary. 
(Applause) Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just -- Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky. 
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. 
I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it. 
Well, we know what they're like today. 
Some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure. 
And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be -- after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee, so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates, we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees, in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash, maybe by just a few hundred genes. 
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. 
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper. 
And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place. 
By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter) Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. 
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia, is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful, incredibly stark, and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. 
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do. 
Plus we have stem cells. 
Have fun. Thank you. 
In 2001, this building received an award. 
Now the largest aquifer in North America is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border, across eight states -- big aquifer: Ogallala, Triassic age. 
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns, no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are. 
In May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. 
It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics. 
I am an emotional creature. 
By the beginning of May, the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted. 
That's one actor, the Security Council. 
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. 
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well. 
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away. 
And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug. 
Why does this matter? Well first because, for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change. 
We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places, the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future? 
And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect. 
So I made one. 
Is there water on Mars? 
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense. 
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. 
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty? 
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event. 
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. 
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly -- again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly, and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life, in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics, and, yes, in the sphere of religion, which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. 
Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc. 
After a counseling session, a woman said to me, "Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again, and I want to participate again in my family life." 
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. 
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later. 
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. 
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it. 
People don't have voice. 
Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. 
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 
Of course, my work turned ugly, but another thing happened. 
Each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down. 
The kinds of systems that will be down there, the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor, consist of -- if you can read them there -- there's cameras, there's pressure sensors, fluorometers, there's seismometers. 
And so, from our perspective, we don't realize that that's how it began. 
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth, breastfeeding. 
They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong. 
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy, or McMafia, for short. 
So it's on legs, so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. 
When the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad, what did you do, what were you thinking?" 
This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago, and I recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices, different devices, but the same voice. 
"Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright. 
And third, they're all attracted to each other, but they try to keep a small distance apart. 
And one day, one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought. 
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side. 
This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. 
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season, and if it doesn't, the grassland and the soil begin to die. 
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. 
We had to age the teeth over time. 
I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain, but at the same time so frustrated. 
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. 
And dance has progressed. 
And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head. 
And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery. 
Because he's got an efficient enough factory. 
But it wasn't that simple. 
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!" 
The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way. 
The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution, and its graduates will form a powerful network, working together for peace and progress across the continent. 
Now, how do you create compassion? 
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me. 
So they took me. I was a message, they said. 
How did this happen? 
So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. 
Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb. 
So that was a normal working ship. 
This guy is a little more contemplative. 
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place. 
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter. 
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full. 
He's always on the road. 
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves. 
It's going to be simple to accomplish this. 
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test. 
He keeps mobilizing. 
We have a lot to learn. 
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge. 
And I got home and something happened. 
And this is just the same. 
Child: I think he is going to take that one. 
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me? 
I have a suggestion. 
So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. 
Nothing else. 
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night. 
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform. 
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. 
(Laughter) I kid you not. That's exactly what it said. 
Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn. 
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. 
We have this principal that we don't touch; that produces returns, social, economic and ecological. 
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity? 
So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap, or company A versus company B, or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius, you know what, let it go. 
And the big question, of course, is why? 
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand. 
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet. 
Social groups are taking to the streets. 
And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you. 
So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based; they could be decentralized, or centralized. 
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before. 
Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand. 
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago, markets did well. 
The machines would rise up against us. 
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks. 
I became bizarrely popular. 
"Um, Abed," I said, "I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash." 
Texting: I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting, a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see -- hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else -- or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL, LMAO, HMU. 
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about, but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said, there's a lot of humans evolving speaking, about 100 billion people in fact. 
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture, and it's 60 times larger than all the areas we complain about, our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live. 
Does that sound good? 
So to close, my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me that physics is cool, and hopefully, I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special. 
Here's a typical street view. 
Chef: Oh. 
It doesn't really matter what the statements are about, what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority. 
There's another reason as well. 
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's one in a thousand, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy. 
(Applause) So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? 
And we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on. 
Precipice running to and running from human beings. 
When you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that. 
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky? 
Now, I want you to put your data on the web. 
And we're going to look at their saving behavior. 
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up! 
We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you. 
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians. 
I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother. 
Nonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it. 
And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. 
It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome. 
That's the instructions for running -- this is actually the source code for one of those universes, with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems. 
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging, my colleague, Andrew Kung, grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic. 
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires. 
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. 
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing, what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. 
And then I said, "Goodbye." 
A few had good grades. 
The person said, "No, that's fine." 
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access, but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer, it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface. 
I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain. 
And here, what we found was completely unexpected. 
But while that competition is going on within the boat, this competition is going on across boats. 
As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. 
Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide to release the animal back into the river. 
You're not going to defy gravity. 
This is work from a number of years ago, but what I'll show you next is updated science, it's updated technology. 
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade. 
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself? 
There will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year, thousands losing their jobs everyday in America. 
And it's very, very hard to get information from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. 
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark from windmills, not from oil. 
And Baron-Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills, and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped. 
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. 
But who's doing even better? 
And then somebody complained. 
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi, which I think is a great name. 
And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization. 
Everyone has done something. 
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities. 
So that's just what we did. 
One can say that a bad thing sucks, but that this natural world still has many glories. 
But there is a curious asymmetry here. 
Also around this time, at home, this was the computer that people were buying. 
And it talked about how to build your own house, how to grow your own food, all kinds of things. 
If they're eating chemicals all the time, they're not going to be able to think. 
This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this. 
They're open, they're available to everyone within our application, and educators have really got on board with the classrooms. 
(Laughter) In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two. 
When we measured the forces, they were enormous. 
Marcus: The Panthers. 
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult. 
How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum. 
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. 
Not a challenging task. 
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance, and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. 
So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals -- pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo -- that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. 
(Laughter) And so what they're doing -- each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card, which they sell for 10 bucks, they drew original works of art. 
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact, so this is a type of neo-catastrophism, and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit; and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. 
Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. 
And so, I've spent the last three years on this. 
The first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here. 
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. 
But there were consequences. 
It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us, more moral than us, and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high. 
Let's bring the military back again." 
And as wondrous as it is, it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired. 
You've got to have vision. 
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. 
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you. 
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. 
Embrace the shake. 
And then my sister woke up. 
I started writing fiction in English. 
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims, jihad is an internal struggle for the faith. 
We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen. 
"First, say to yourself what you would be. 
And it's used for communication. 
Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance -- but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles in a particular sequence. 
I talk a lot about these issues. 
It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness, where there is 90 percent reduction of key species, like woodland caribou and grizzly bears, and it consumes even more energy, more water, and produces at least as much greenhouse gas. 
So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. 
Political, economic, psychological, whatever. 
And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. 
So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said, "Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together. 
So it sounds like a great story. 
Man: Just try both of them. 
With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica, you can, for example, make precise programs that call on real world data. 
And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. 
These people are tall. 
We use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers. 
One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home, and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. 
So once you have that in mind, how do you go about building this voice? 
And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale. 
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent. 
And -- (Laughter) -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. 
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups. 
This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood. 
When the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the EPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this, and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy. 
Nobody tells anybody what to do. 
Some people are doing that, many are not. What's going on? 
I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance. 
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that, because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways, will be solved by building walls. 
And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you -- what does this genetic information do? 
The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries, was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship. 
Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms: issue, position and architectural manifestation. 
These are hopping microbot swarms. 
In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it, changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor, changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating, at will. 
This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley, and when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who's a world-renowned professor of philosophy, and I talked with him about this, and he said, "This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics, and up through Descartes. 
We have online criminals. 
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age, through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience. 
Just recognizing your body, recognizing the body's motions, the tech, understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. 
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country. 
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. 
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact, that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists. 
It's an interaction between volunteers, passionate inventors and technology, and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. 
The dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent Google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. 
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world, putting up wires to get power from where it's created to where it's used. 
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. 
And, you know, we open it up and I read the music. 
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. 
And how did we do that? 
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective. 
So here is a daily activity of the studio. 
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews -- tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place. 
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming, photography; while the helicopter was still there, I did an interview on the satellite phone; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter, wham, the door closed, and I was alone. 
We give you white pages. Invent. 
Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia, and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival. 
"OK, so I stopped at a light and there's a guy, you know, in the back." 
Because we can't eliminate a single seat, the architecture is restricted to 18 inches. 
One day, my daughter Tybee, Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy, I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. 
Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care. 
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. 
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short. 
It typically reads CAD data, which is a product design data created on professional product design programs. 
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there. 
It's important that we build this platform, that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying, "Look, we must do something different." 
Market exchange, they assume, doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged. 
So here's to another day at the office. 
I cannot speak; I can only type so fast. 
It's three-quarters, roughly, which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear. 
Instead, it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own, but as the representative of something larger. 
I want to warn you about that. 
But we don't just experience them, we show them. 
I want you to take a trip with me. 
Because we don't want to move genes around? 
And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance, but ultimately we knock them down. 
And that's what happened there. 
But surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks, with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there, and now, because of that authentic experience, you can charge two, three, four, five dollars for a cup of coffee. 
And he described one of them as very "common." 
This needs to stop, and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems, and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it. 
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall, that cap is now widening and getting higher. 
(Laughter) And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought, like I'm speaking to you now, right, but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions, because the more I got to know him and his system, the more exciting this whole idea became. 
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication." 
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute-force assembly techniques. 
That's quantum mechanics. 
We often won't even notice them. 
And I said, "Of course it is." 
But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do. 
(Applause) The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good. 
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari, a longtime San Francisco educator -- she was teaching in Mexico City, she had all the experience necessary, knew everything about education, was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood -- I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching. 
This is a spider mite. 
So let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value. 
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. 
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. 
Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form. 
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. 
It's not a lot of money at the global level. 
Scissors are your clothes, glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles, and books are, after all, your education. 
So when they had a look at it afterward, there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation. 
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. 
It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly -- looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties -- they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment. 
What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid, open-ended discovery? 
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know. 
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. 
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all. 
Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All, we will need to involve all in that particular journey, and in the case of mental health, in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers. 
I started experimenting, making models, talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback, and refining, and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years. 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 
There were a couple of examples here. 
She was with me on my lifeboat. 
And they text back. 
They don't employ those workers. 
But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. 
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor, after the Latin word "volant," meaning, to fly in a light, nimble manner. 
A common thinking error of radiologists, for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. 
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. 
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling. 
So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes, but also, perhaps in the future, in a more clinical situation. 
So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. 
(Laughter) One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person. 
But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point. 
First time ever going out of her village. 
We still think it is pristine. 
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters. 
But it's self-evident assessment. 
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. 
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that. 
And we've accomplished close to zip. 
Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you. 
We know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies. 
But we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy. 
(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate. 
And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression. 
She said, "The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older." 
So we started the company. 
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space. 
Her mother died while giving birth to her, and no one had any idea who her father was." 
But on my left retina there is a bump, which is marked there by the red arrow. 
So I want you to think back a few months ago. 
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see; this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion, the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning, and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. 
"So you admit it's all interpretation. 
And keep an eye out for sharks. 
"This is my car, and I'm going to drive around and show off my car." 
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. 
In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies. 
It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do and it turns out that's really important, because how do you stop an asteroid like this? 
(Applause) Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick. 
A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables. 
Now she thinks the powder is sugar. 
"I" passes insensibly into a "we," "my" becomes "our" and individual faith loses its central importance. 
Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think. (Laughter) BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task like this -- this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for. But we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general, because these are ingredients, you know, plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with, and two, we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don't eat them. 
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. 
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness. 
(Applause) This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements." 
In short, they make cities better places to live. 
And this caused me to scratch my head, because as I went back through his several-hundred-page book, I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table, reference or footnote. 
And on my seventeenth birthday, I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence, as I always had all my life -- my visually impaired sister -- to go to see an eye specialist. 
And if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us. 
Now this is one of the images. 
And they tapped into the fact that, if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them, you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on. 
You’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it’s not emphysema. 
Please note that this is necrophilia. 
For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. 
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like, "Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!" 
This is not a question between privacy against security. 
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power. 
And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. 
And we then call that schizophrenia. 
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation. 
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him. 
Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. 
So what's the endgame? 
If version 10 is coming out next week, there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine. 
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story, or I find it beautiful. 
There's just silence and a cool temperature. 
(Laughter) She gave me an indulgent smile, and as punishment, she said, "Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history, and you are sitting in it, and I'm grading you." 
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof. 
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. 
What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes. 
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting." 
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know, that we counted all the child deaths, even if we didn't do anything about it. 
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. 
If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet, it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. 
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches -- access negotiators. 
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made, the EV1, out of -- and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart. 
Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. 
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. 
(Laughter) Oh, sorry. 
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to. 
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. 
And if we look at what we start with, a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns, perfect would be that red line. 
(Laughter) The lower level employees thought it was very funny. 
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial, and we all have infomercials about our lives. 
And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin, who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called "Ain't No Grave." 
They can disappear and escape bullets. 
Another three years. 
So if these ideas are correct, this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. 
Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry. 
And so he started clustering it by category, and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it. 
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things? 
Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. 
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing? 
They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV. 
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right? 
And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. 
And this is about a little over four billion years ago. 
To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. 
The building on the right at the top is now under construction. 
I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time, -- a little over 200 feet -- and, I had caught this little fish here. 
So, this is for the best humanoid, and we would like to bring this for the very first time, to the United States next year, so wish us luck. 
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. 
I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism, because I know that when evil men destroy, good men must build and bind. 
(Laughter) Didn't really work out that way, did it? 
While globalization has increased travel, it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere, all the time, all over the world. 
If you think about the world, and even just in this audience, most of us are involved with buildings. 
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. 
I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. 
But self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. 
I can look at the skull structure, and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman, and that's where they went in. 
And the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G. 
Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch. 
Country 1 has a systematic advantage over Country 2 in infrastructures. 
See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets -- (Portamento) -- and you can get it really low. 
What it means is that we have a layered control system. 
So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the -- I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article about something called "purine derivatives." 
And actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? 
You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best. 
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. 
About 300 of them were there. 
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. 
All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. 
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page. 
And the way that I'm going to do that is, I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria. 
Let me give you one example of this. 
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them, and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are, and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach, and this is where the best fish restaurant is." 
Thank you. 
Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot and said to the governors across the country, compete for it. 
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time. 
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him. 
Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba, with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there. 
They are going to be cued these three square words: "like," "not" and "head." 
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water. 
Why not? 
And then, because I'm looking for the upside here, I've got to have believable upside. 
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys. 
So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested. 
But as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone. 
So using that new twist, with the new criteria, we thought we could re-look at the Stirling engine, and also bring genetic algorithms in. 
More complex structures such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you, they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. 
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. 
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic, and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. 
Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response? 
You know, you can choose your list. 
First, we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition, and this allows us to temporally align all of the examples, and then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory, that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. 
SM: A decade ahead of her time. 
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. 
Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. 
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. 
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. 
I do. 
And we park. And we stay. 
So, in fact, my graduate students are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope, in Hawaii, making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage, where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars, and so few old stars. 
And with the known physics etc, it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake, many years ago, and Shklovsky. 
We have many intuitions in our life, and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong. 
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. 
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. 
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. 
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world, and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits, new habits of mind. 
Thank you very much. 
We're telling the germs out there how to fight us. 
Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad. 
First, don't become a cannibal. 
So there are two really remarkable things about this. 
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals. 
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst, but, in fact, 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners. 
(Laughter) BF: They're a good crew! Whoa! 
"Now what shall we do?" said the king. 
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. 
Almost all of my kids live below poverty. 
We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content. 
Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do. 
So from that perspective, maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. 
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. 
You don't choose the spoken word. 
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music. 
And that has all sorts of advantages. 
They take it for granted that, come what may, people have to follow them, while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people. 
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. 
So this is a huge practical problem. 
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze. 
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn, and that bothers me. 
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered. 
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and it's called "Floating Memories." 
The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking. 
So, many times when you try to do research on data, it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data. 
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta. 
And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. 
So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth. 
And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows? 
Take Meeker, Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there, and put that in space as well, and Mt. Everest, and K2, and the Indian peaks. 
Child: After all this time here, music is life. 
So, thank you very much. 
And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer. 
But for molecular programming, our question is, how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone? 
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you, "Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content. 
So we said, this looks bad. 
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. 
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year. 
It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy. 
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else? 
(Applause) Roy Gould: Less than a year from now, the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy, which marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope. 
But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist, and why she'd never tried to recruit me. 
They end up being very large pictures, and I photographed with a very large camera -- an 8x10 camera. 
But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special. 
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. 
Why have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now? 
We are being watched. 
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. 
(Laughter) I belong to an Internet discussion forum, an African Internet discussion forum, and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly 204 African heads of state, since 1960." 
Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet? 
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today. 
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. 
Is that you?" 
And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes. 
That's what Wired magazine spent on this. 
So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural. 
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. 
So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube, and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from YouTube, all the comments, all the views, who's watching it, where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments. 
When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census, we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands. 
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars. 
Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. 
(Music) For this delight and for this wonder, people rejoiced. 
Of course, you got it wrong. 
Recently we have just started a program, a sport program -- basketball for wheelchair users. 
Does your brain have to send little painters in there? 
So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe? 
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK? 
(Applause) As you can see, that's Charlton Heston brought down to size. 
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. 
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. 
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. 
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence. 
And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel? 
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. 
So thank you very much. 
Let's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else. 
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe, grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene -- he has other kinds of glamour. 
And these are studies commissioned by the Zionist organization for alternative areas for Jewish settlement. 
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. 
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice." 
We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it. 
And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North, actually near Afghanistan, and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past, Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. 
Thank you. 
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night. 
So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days, but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy, largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. 
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this. 
In the forensic case -- and this is something that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. 
It's like nothing you've ever done. 
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here. 
So, to explain this curious disorder, we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain. 
Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space. 
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it, not just with big businesses, but small businesses all over the country. 
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes. 
The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. 
We did that in most of the places. 
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water. 
You've heard about solar flares. 
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking, if you only visit porn sites, you're safer. 
The creator doesn't have any rights. 
It took place, once, in 326 B.C. 
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one. 
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. 
This is happening just south of the border. 
And there are nine other winners who get prizes. 
Well let me tell you, in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year, because the Arab Spring is still spreading, the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else? 
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument. 
So here it is. 
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter. 
(Applause) So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. 
I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons. 
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing -- because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time; you want to be feeling the music. 
This is what they go through. 
The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers. 
Thank you. 
Larry, you can explain this one. 
You're thinking, "That's just ridiculous. No way." 
What is morality and where does it come from? 
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer. 
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now. 
We are, should be, morally committed to being the healer of the world. 
"Oh beloved dentist: Your rubber fingers in my mouth ... 
And we struggled with the image. 
Remember, it's a question about JavaScript. 
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence, and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy. 
We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff. 
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that, at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. 
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data. 
First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. 
I'll give you one example. 
So the impact is very strong. 
Anyway, moving along. 
They serviced the loans. 
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. 
They were getting mutilated, and here, after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N., I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was in my face. 
Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon? 
And so, we can't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system. 
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment -- asked me to do these posters. 
And for me, the Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve, has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. 
And would we revert back to being more like animals, more primal modes of communication? 
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase, an energy protein. 
It's called momentum. 
They disappeared. 
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me. 
Of course, migration will become even more important. 
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient. 
He can read a novel or two a day. 
Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz. 
In cosmology, for example, there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures. 
And because we cannot do it on our own, we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author, any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education, can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming. 
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. 
He has a purpose in life. 
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists; it's about your freedoms. 
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they usually don't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author, and vice versa, connecting and empathizing with the narrator. 
This is Richard Muthama Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. 
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. 
We do need to really start trying. 
You can guess what happened next, right? (Laughter) The outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous, that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves the same day and said, "We would, we would never censor a nine-year-old." (Laughter) Except, of course, this morning. (Laughter) And this brings up the question, what made them think they could get away with something like that? (Laughter) And the answer is, all of human history prior to now. 
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. 
(Rattling) Another moment. 
We play musical instruments. 
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials. 
These are not dying peoples. 
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay? 
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open learning, imagination, creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children. 
A couple of years into the process, I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design. 
They might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show. 
Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. 
And this data can be used by investors. 
That's the history of foie gras. 
Let's see if we can actually make life. 
What they want are implements to increase their production: something to fertilize the soil, something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market. 
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy, rather than against democracy. 
Make yourself understood to the computer." 
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example. 
Now, the previous two examples I gave were to do with construction sector corruption, okay? 
And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures. 
And we imitate from almost the second we are born. 
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. 
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere. 
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones. 
Here is an innovation, a design innovation. 
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program, and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership, only to end up being tortured by their heroes. 
This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough. 
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.

This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water. 
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school." 
Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes." 
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter." 
And people oohed and ahhed, because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken. 
Why is this useful, or what does it tell us? 
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis. 
And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this. 
That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. 
Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is, so when these things come back, they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love. 
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. 
Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should. 
Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called "Cancer Alley," and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and, in the process, kills people. 
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. 
So that's obvious, right. 
(Laughter) But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. 
That is emotional correctness. 
Big, big problem. 
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. 
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see. 
I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. 
"What does it matter?" 
This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way. 
Well, to describe our profession otherwise, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. 
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. 
And my idea was to make the space tangible. 
Can you imagine tossing a coin successively? 
Anything that we do spreads ripples. 
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world. 
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart. 
What should you take home from all of this? 
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do. 
RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.) (Applause) On the 30th of May, 1832, a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris. 
Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane? 
But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. 
Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop, stop with this struggle of for and against? 
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. 
Our species are ocean-basin-wide. 
Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary. 
He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales. 
Well, we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together, but there are more ideas to try. 
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety." 
And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening." 
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to, again, raise awareness. 
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust, which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail, and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out. 
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions, both driven by modern efficiency, and you get the really big story: reinventing fire, where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050, saving 5 trillion dollars, growing the economy 2.6-fold, strengthening out national security, oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal, reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent. 
I'm coming out. 
So I was filming. 
The United States is the only superpower, and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. 
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant, while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison, the Chief of Urology at Harvard, actually harvesting the kidney. 
I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past. 
You know, they pick up their hives; they move their families once or twice in a year. 
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that? 
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept. 
RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add. 
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways. 
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material. 
(Laughter) And it walks away. So, this is DARwIn IV. 
But the more I talked about it, the more objectified and fragmented my body became. 
(Laughter) But predicting how nature works is a very risky game. 
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. 
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz" and all the movies we watch today. 
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. 
So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. 
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies, they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. 
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru? 
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts. 
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame? 
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed. 
For the water system, the trees are essential. 
We have babies. 
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. 
So we celebrated. 
(Laughter) And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations. 
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers, armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor. 
There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site. 
♫ Oh, ah, ah, ah ♫ ♫ Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh ♫ ♫ If you'd ever been out walking you would know ♫ (Applause) Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much. The show's not over. 
Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff, but you have to wait quite a long time. 
And of course, we have fashion. 
It's not that simple. 
On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer. 
Now that last mile, last foot, in a sense, is the first step of the infrastructure. 
A deer freezes very, very still, poised to run away. 
He said, "It's a what?" 
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. 
You would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that? 
Everybody, of course, drinks exactly the same wine. 
When the participants arrived for their interview, I offered them a set of drinks: Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite -- seven, to be exact. 
And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today. 
And the dragons that arose are still among us today. 
The water is completely black. 
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. 
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. 
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. 
And that sugar dough? 
Guns and bombs are nothing new. 
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement. 
You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another, and they support weight. 
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?" 
I played a lot of chess. 
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. 
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives, until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef. 
There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side. 
You make a blood flow movie, you have an independent proxy of brain activity. 
Heparin -- a blood thinner, a pharmaceutical product -- starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China, because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. 
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace. 
Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. 
Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago -- the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 130,000 years. 
It cannot hide behind the black hole. 
And this is when it really gets interesting. 
How many children will you get? 
But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock." 
(Laughter) This is by Z. Zhou, and he's interested in stasis. 
We are only happy when things are in order. 
And yet, on the front porch of that man's cabin, I saw four fish. He had to feed his family to survive. 
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer. 
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up, and they use their teenage years to practice social skills, and at about the age of nine, the females become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant, and the males mature quite a bit later, at around 15 years of age. 
Here what I call "the spinal brain" cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk, to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving. 
And so as the quake was happening the news was reported. 
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. 
And it led us to the project, the courthouse, which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse. 
For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family. 
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls. 
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. 
Now BRD4 is an interesting protein. 
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland. 
There's great feedback. 
Every time a new technology is being introduced, criminals are there to exploit it. 
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid. 
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it? 
Leslie Chang: One minute? 
In reality, many choices are between things that are not that much different. 
So the question is, which camps are at risk, how many people are in these camps, what's the timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation? 
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit. 
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. 
I think you've already heard the figures. 
There is what Doctor Oz tells us. 
And you know, for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer, and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. 
Not something you'd envy or want to do. 
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in. 
Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa, faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos. 
Well, it's pretty simple. 
And here it is with the abstract surrounding. 
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this. 
JC: Thank you, Thomas. 
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it. 
"Connected" is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. 
It's just happening. 
And a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin, which enables the building to be ventilated, to consume dramatically less energy, and where it's really working with the forces of nature. 
That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they're trying to solve. 
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope, and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick. 
So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object. 
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. 
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound. 
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. 
I believe we can and I hope we will. 
The bees like it in the city. (Laughter) Furthermore, they also produce more honey. 
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?" 
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed. 
So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants, want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government, they want the emperor to settle the problem. 
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes? 
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us. 
But then, after World War I, things dropped, and we get this historically low level of polarization. 
The strange one looks likes this: that we live in a three-dimensional world. 
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion. 
So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged, don't kick yourself. 
I had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids. 
And it's a tremendous problem for us. 
And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it. 
And here I've taken away the robots, but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. 
That would be very boring. 
That's what we're after. 
Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies. 
And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. 
That is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older. 
So many more people would have been affected. 
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. 
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips. 
(Music) (Laughter) (Music) Hey. 
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. 
And the question is, how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value? 
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. 
When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down. 
And I thought it was so fantastic. 
They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love. 
We created public health care. 
You overcompensate. 
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. 
And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team, and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. 
(Laughter) Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... 
This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much, using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money, to make the world a better place, to fight -- to fight wrongs, to solve problems. 
(Laughter) That's the Green System. It all folds in half on the Green System, right between 18 and 19. 
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode, grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. 
Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor, but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules that do specific things for us. 
Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. 
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines, have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse. 
We've got what's rational for public health. 
So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se. 
A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them, and it's difficult, because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. 
Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. 
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education. 
Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe. 
And how many would be opposed? How many would -- So the majority here are opposed, but a sizable minority are in favor. 
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free. 
And she came back, I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site. 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment. 
So if he's successful, she won't be the last. 
So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk, and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world. 
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes." 
Their calculations are different. 
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call "crowd-accelerated innovation." 
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin. 
You get one of these ballot forms at random, and then you go into the voting booth, and you mark your choices, and you tear along a perforation. 
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp. 
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? 
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. 
So, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest, he absolutely did. 
This came in, like, six different colors. 
Has it been tried before? 
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. 
And here, you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. 
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. 
Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. 
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds. 
They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work. 
Besides the known Higgs state, there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today, and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. 
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you. 
So your sofa, your plastic chair, your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. 
So, I think it's as low-cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things. 
Hyun-Sook was 11 years old. 
Thank you very much. 
So, another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will. 
(Applause) You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen: HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night. 
HIV-positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV-negative babies. 
BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. 
So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub. 
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired, if now catastrophic, change for human development? 
Now if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do? 
Those are not Fibonacci numbers, but if you look at them closely, you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them. 
You need to see what to do. 
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution, so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment. 
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited, unfished, pristine islands and a few inhabited islands. 
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay? 
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer. 
It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. 
It improves our ability to learn. 
They vary between cultures, between nations, between individuals, between social classes, between education levels. 
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. 
(Audience: Ten of diamonds.) LG: Pardon? 
Then we were victims of the French. 
As a fish nerd, I have to laugh, because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing -- we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy. 
I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of poverty is justice. 
How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. 
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ... 
We can do it with proven technology. 
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process, and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins. 
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal. 
And early in the morning, I went into the ward. 
Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster? 
We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity. 
But those are dots on a screen for you; what exactly does that mean? 
I said, "Something's wrong here." 
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is. 
So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Here in America, 90 percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil. 
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK? 
Everybody has an opinion. 
But I'd worry about that later, because right now I had a dream. 
But they weren't given that choice, because their own citizens beat them to the punch. 
And third, can China do without killer app number three? 
They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. 
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story, because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. 
And these are examples of some of the kids' work. 
The developing world, mostly left out of the current response, sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they're leapfrogging the West. 
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to. 
They called me. 
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women, educating them, educating the children, so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society. 
And two magical things happened after he was born. 
And then I said, "Close your eyes." 
Imaginative play. 
So I don't know how much this is helping me, but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off. 
And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. 
If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift, it will be the same good. 
So we need something to be able to explain that. 
So here's a little fractal model for it. 
Hardly anyone in South America did. 
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' — Davis 2009, TEDx Women"] I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world. 
Why or why not? 
Goldfish swam. 
That means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel, forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art. 
And I told the author, after they did my interview, that I cheated in that same course. 
The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places. 
and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them: there are just new ones every year. 
Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995, and he was rescued after a week. 
But it's taken all stakeholders, working together -- teachers and principals on one-year contracts, working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation. 
But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently. 
I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line. 
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology, biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species, to bring the current total to 5,400, and more continue to pour in. 
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. 
It's manifestations of a disease. 
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking. 
Even the cowboys are pit crews now. 
And it did happen this way. 
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. 
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint, it pauses, it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment, and then it turns around. 
It's very, very interesting that men, more than women, tend to be more competitive here. 
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. 
Imagine that you're going to the theater. 
You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s under a climate of political distress, and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way -- in a sort of a semiotic black market. 
And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this, and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk, and when they got back to their car, they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months. 
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal. 
Now it had a sense of place. 
But according to a really great science historian you might know, Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard -- what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest, this real passion for design. 
And this is why I use the analogy to coral. 
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual. 
It has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. 
And these are the neighborhoods, for example, in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up; they were decimated. 
The Indian family said, no way! 
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?" 
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year. 
The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. 
My balloon will expand to 500 times and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top. 
And so it was, our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom, looking forward to settling into his new life. 
Last question, then: how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons, and in particular, if great apes are larger than we are, why don't they have a larger brain than we do, with more neurons? 
I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even. 
(Laughter) She should not go into banking, for example, or work at a cash register. 
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. 
Very, very sadly, our foreign services, the United Nations, the military in these countries have very little idea of what's going on. 
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market. 
Second, China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. 
That brain system -- the reward system for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus -- becomes more active when you can't get what you want. 
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause) Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images. 
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington, I couldn't help but say, "You know, you look a lot like an old friend of mine." 
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face. 
And the minute you tell me that -- boom! You know, I discount half of what you're saying from then on. 
Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen, which was that, "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta." 
So, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. 
So the first commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly. 
But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37. 
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test. 
So, I began to do a research project of my own. 
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside. 
But I ask you today, what would you do if you had to choose? 
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space. 
Big businesses have recognized this, and what's fascinating about this slide, it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off. 
The sporting goods industry, in particular, stepped up to the plate and have done it. 
And at heart, both reformations, I think were asking the questions: who's entitled to practice? 
There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: That was remarkable. 
I don't think that's the case though. 
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. 
They extend long and delicate branches, and in short, they look like trees. 
And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups, because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains, the tools they made, are always made from local materials. 
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. 
I think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. 
Liver, lungs, heads, tails, kidneys, testicles, delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last 30 years. 
And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control. 
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach, and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this." 
The walls are this thick. 
And that was a real gift you gave this audience. 
And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign, this is what we need to do now with heart. 
I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right, but I've done this now for 30 years, and it has stayed on this exponential progression. 
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. 
23 -- 24, sorry, 24. 
Since then, the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions, publishing books. 
One year later, the next declarations of impossibilities began. 
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. 
"Strange," he agreed. 
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs, and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away. 
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world, is, I think, only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor. 
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body, an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees. 
And that tells me this: that Africa is going to go from a $2 trillion economy today to a $29 trillion economy by 2050. 
We've made it about changing the world. 
But it is increasingly possible. 
As long as our books are written in English -- because people are rewriting them and recopying them -- it's going to be there. 
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid. 
And this is absolutely key. 
First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling. 
And unfortunately, the local junior high was not going to offer that. 
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success. 
And these await our discovery. 
They learned to start with cell phones. 
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. 
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself, who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5. 
To say I wonder is to say I question, I ask. 
(Laughter) Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly. 
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations. 
Worse, some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. 
On the competitiveness front, we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. 
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
And we save some of those for the next generation. 
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. 
It could be NBC. It could be ABC. 
And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. 
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a letter, because they're forgetful. 
I was working to transform these internalized responses, to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair, by creating unexpected images. 
All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident. 
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers. 
And I was so disappointed, and I was like, "Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?" 
Why is it hard to treat? 
So I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout, the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. 
This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution. 
And not all conductors do just that. 
Got a couple questions for you. 
The tool styles don't change that much. 
We did move the comet a little tiny bit, not very much, but that wasn't the point. 
And the garden, it was beautiful. 
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have. 
(Laughter) So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately consumed by Americans. 
Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value. 
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. 
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring. 
It's in his book "The Four Loves." 
There's no hot water. 
They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature. 
Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is. 
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister, I met the commander of ISAF, the international troops. 
So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. 
Come here. 
But with the pendulum, it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. 
Of course, they covered that with make-up, because Lara Croft did all those same stunts -- but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura. 
Now we need to have a bit more engagement, and again, what we can do is we can look at the body. 
If we all do our part, I think we'll be in a much better space. 
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief. 
We have to go for a global truce. 
And you need to put some new incisions in there. 
So Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference. 
That's what they see every day. 
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. 
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes. 
(Laughter) And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. 
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College, an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. 
People outside that circle are treated as sub-human, and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history, the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record, it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe, to the nation, to other races, to both sexes, and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend to other sentient species. The question is, if this has happened, what has powered that expansion? 
Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated. 
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure. 
The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing. 
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks. 
That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot? 
Home electronics. 
Two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance. 
It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. 
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches, through all our digital photographs and cameras. 
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability. 
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve. 
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. 
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse. 
The magazines started to cover it. 
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. 
It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active. 
And then a few days later I sent her this. 
I had more than 50 surgeries. 
We did about 325 shots. 
That's the world people actually want. 
Oh, it's actually a really, really, important set of concepts. 
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase, and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again, and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies. 
This is a disaster. 
I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck, heavy with four tons of floor tiles, had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where I sat. 
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. 
Take-out sandwich shops, film processing drop-offs, peep-shows and necktie stores. 
These are the blue bars. 
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism. 
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. 
You're talking about inclusive innovation. 
They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends, thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium. 
It can break sometimes. 
(Laughter) And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet. 
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality. 
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade, and that was a transition for me to go to high school. 
We're not doing that at any scale on governance. 
Went through design, some architecture. 
And I want to thank her today. 
For me, the issue about aid -- I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid. 
And to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers, there's a bale of hay there and some crab apples. 
(Music) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. 
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. 
Good bye." 
When earthquakes take place, massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. 
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was. 
So you take the next step, or use the next tool available in what we are putting together, and then he relents. 
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. 
The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks, killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. 
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers. 
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. 
I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. 
It doesn't really matter. 
It looks like we're getting somewhere. 
And that's the power of social movements. 
And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light. 
Let's do some mathy thing, and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math. 
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero, or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net, costing the public sector another six dollars a net, give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system that might, over time, start sustaining itself. 
I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country, but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to. 
And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there, we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s. 
If the space I'm sending it in is not effective, that communication can't happen. 
Let me say that again: playing. 
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly, Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object, which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list. 
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. 
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible. 
And they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it. 
It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, "Hey, would you mind?" 
Not based upon the quality of your work, how long you've been there, if you stink, just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered. 
My answer was no, they don't add up. 
They are quite useful for educational purposes. 
(Applause) So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. 
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors in a large developmental study we did, this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood, in the adult group in both conditions, so the gray is the director condition, and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors when there's no director present, when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background. 
From just an idea that sounded crazy, you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. 
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. 
And he was there, Tito Puente. 
And you put a little fan here. 
So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup, and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup. 
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds, that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment. 
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle. 
So, the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology. 
Interestingly, it seemed to correspond more or less to Jung's four subdivisions of human thought. 
In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are." 
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do. 
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light. 
But I need a metabolism, I need some energy. 
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast. 
And here the income per person in comparable dollars. 
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying, but it didn't work. 
(Laughter) So I do these valentines. 
I know, I could barely utter them. 
So, social production is a real fact, not a fad. 
And it brings me to the crux of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on, in the world today, which is that last century was top-down power. 
It's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers. 
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth. 
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500. 
I wanted to do something that was working directly with the world, directly with place. 
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright, and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring." 
Let's put Nigeria in perspective. 
So, why is that? 
But the conditions for compassion to be activated, to be aroused, are particular conditions. 
It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally, across teachers, parents, people involved in education. 
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen. 
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go. 
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside. 
And again, that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space. 
They were holding something like 700 people hostage. 
Imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery, imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. 
(Applause) Take a bow. Take a bow. 
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident. 
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage, we move from a time where our economic success, our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume, to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability. 
And what we did, over the last few months -- well, a few months ago, Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous. 
What matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other, the two explanations are. 
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. 
This is a serval cat. 
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium. 
And we said, "Well, there's another option. 
I mean, the joke "One, Two, Three, Many" is kind of right. 
Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed. 
But drinking 60 great wines over three days, they all just blurred together, and it became almost a grueling experience. 
I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards, but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. 
The Buick's parked outside, and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys. 
In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. 
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. 
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this. 
My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear. 
At age 31 -- that's my age now -- in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming, and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming. 
That every person here, every decision that you've made today, every decision you've made in your life, you've not really made that decision, but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions is made, each one going off into a new universe. 
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles, and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down, and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too, how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building. 
The reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor. (Laughter) He actually moved across the street from us, and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott. 
Okay. So this is my next project. 
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world, like Scandinavia, you already have that. 
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are. 
I remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde. 
And this wasn't a pretty thing. 
You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of. 
(Laughter) But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. 
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. 
(Laughter) Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons, of the toxins of our world. 
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation, the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke -- is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson? 
So "Iron Man" zips right out, and "Waiting for Superman" can wait for a really long time. 
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent. 
And I have a collection, probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. 
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? 
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. 
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?" 
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred. 
And how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that? 
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. 
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. 
♫ You would have seen my face on the telly ♫ ♫ Fat hungry belly ♫ ♫ Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size ♫ ♫ Just another little starving child ♫ ♫ Running around in Africa, born to be wild ♫ ♫ Praise God, praise the Almighty ♫ ♫ for sending an angel to rescue me ♫ ♫ I got a reason for being on this Earth ♫ ♫ 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth ♫ ♫ Now that I got a chance to stand my ground ♫ ♫ I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds ♫ 
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. 
(Applause) We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology. 
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ... 
You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity. 
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test. 
How can the nervous system get this so wrong? 
But you can actually perversely tell people to come, convince them that they have to come. 
That's somehow unprofessional and bad. 
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress. 
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy, who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone. 
Now some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate? 
There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect." 
with no employees. 
And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years, and looked to see what the relationship is. 
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing, not just dying, but they're gone. 
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse. 
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons. 
So what kind of a contributor was I? 
What they were doing was returning the favor, by giving us a hypothesis to test, in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of. 
For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [for television]. 
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food. 
And for example, the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. 
I don't believe we should. 
Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals, and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head. 
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul. 
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case, were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends. 
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places. 
OK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right? 
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side, but in terms of the system itself? 
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?" 
This is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV, but smarter, faster, stronger. 
(Laughter) And what this data represents for our family at a personal level, the impact has already been immense, and we're still learning its value. 
And I can try steering the car here by ... 
Or when you understood something you had never done before. 
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room. 
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize. 
Now, you can carry this in your wallet, so ... 
There is one key difference with the airplane patent pool. 
In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases. 
Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies, the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. 
And we can question these values. 
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else. 
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto. 
Why does everyone get rid of me? 
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured by number of books sold, mentions in media, or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization, is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore, cross-border integration is close to complete, and we live in one world. 
And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. 
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid. 
Please note it's a museum specimen, but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. 
And we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long. 
Time for development, not 10 years. 
Already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. 
(Laughter) What is this all about? 
But the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb isn't the inventory or the money. 
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing, it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code. 
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days, and people feel that, for whatever reason, it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. 
There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. 
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this. 
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping. 
The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices, economic choices. 
Had I heard right? 
One, two, one, two, three, four. 
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis, it turns black, and then it falls off. 
(Music) See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. 
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld. 
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. 
This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) So, the first robot to talk about is called STriDER. 
Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail. 
The twins started producing milk. 
And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks -- I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks, as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation. 
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device, that I also kind of have a nervous tic. 
That's Euler, his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool. 
But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern. 
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop. 
We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure." 
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel, often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot, to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. 
(Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. 
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details. 
So that part of it took a long time to work out. 
What I would like to offer here is a challenge. 
But there's still a lot of work to do. 
You think, well it's been up, it's been down, its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down. 
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values. 
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. 
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level. 
So, from there to the world of real work. 
Everybody points and laughs, and they say, "He tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work. 
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. 
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up. 
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. 
And I love them because they pay the rent on time. 
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. 
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are. 
And what's more, I'm really lucky, because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide. 
Who is a professional? 
I was a sign from God, they said. 
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism. 
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. 
Now, I could make a game called Piecraft, where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies. 
And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie "The Matrix." 
Now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves, and what their peers think of them. 
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels. 
One out of 10 are saving enough. 
Rather, he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm, and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important. 
They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid. 
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now? 
(Applause) Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign every year. 
But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. 
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found. 
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. 
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing. 
He's at a technology conference in Florida. 
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe -- and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK -- and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. 
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. 
My son, soon after his first birthday, would say "gaga" to mean water. 
We'd been working in health and wellness, and K through 12, and the Developing World. 
And then, abandoning all our gear, we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night, in a quite dramatic scene. 
Stand up, my friends. 
If you tell to people, we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world, people will laugh at you, except here, where crazy people are invited to speak. 
He said, well, entropy increases because there are many, many more ways for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy. 
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. 
So we just started making a list. 
The volume of surgery had spread around the world, but the safety of surgery had not. 
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria. 
And now we can go to the library." 
You see it there? There? Watch it come down. 
And you can also see the way that it was drawn. 
An object devoid of intent -- it's random, it's imitative, it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away. 
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't. 
Because architecture is also the asking of questions. 
It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play. 
They want their shape to persist. 
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. 
I compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum. 
Thank you. (Applause) Well, it's great to be here. 
And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. 
Well, you know precisely what it is. 
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped, and there was a 15 percent survival rate. 
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. 
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets, we need to think about that. 
He ran and worked in a factory. 
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. 
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority. 
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is. 
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. 
It takes eight seconds to do this, and now that that's done, we can choose a movement-based action. 
That's about three times the recorded music industry. 
I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. 
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030, because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. 
So I converted this into an interactive app, so I can now generate this application online -- this is the visualization online -- and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant." 
In fact, that's progress. 
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today, not consciously, of course, but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. 
This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. 
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures, as a result of which he now can walk. 
I put photography as my life. 
So then you realize there are these conventions. 
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye. 
There's some sand that's really much more colorful. 
Cabinet ministers would admit this. 
You can see this is a major shipping airport, and there's all kinds of activity there. 
It's like mushrooms coming through concrete. 
I have another experience: In my writing class, I give students a special assignment. 
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is. 
They have parochial interests. 
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. 
I think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?" 
It's a little mechanical pen that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen. 
Their business trajectory would change. 
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century. 
He is an actor playing the part of a magician. 
AK: Can't clap with this one. 
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. 
Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life. 
We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study, and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. 
The year is 1993 and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this. 
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. 
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users, but it shouldn't be. 
They had to suspend functions at 8:30. 
Every top adds up to 37. 
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab, requires a long-term perspective. 
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are. 
The ability to -- it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification, perhaps. 
If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money. 
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect." 
But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss." 
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, and it heats up after these volcanoes. 
And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places. 
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven. 
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. 
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. 
After eight years of rejection, I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City. 
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library, if you could find the library, right? 
Two -- and it was two of spades, right? 
But that alone doesn't give us the road map. 
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't, and where it was in the phase. 
You learn bamboo building. 
When did that last happen? 
Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior, and they are disorders of the mind. 
I want you to be happy." 
They didn't say money. 
Thank you. 
I think this is mostly what we do. 
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan. 
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. 
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. 
And perhaps most important of all, two years later when the exam results came through, the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top -- in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of GCSE's, which is the British marking system. 
The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive, dark green-gray, striated aluminum siding. 
This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. 
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know. 
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. 
So we organized a screening. 
The ocean representation would have a depth to it. 
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind. 
There was lots of money and reputations at stake. 
Military power is important. 
The deeper you go, the loopier you get. 
And what I then found out about what's called the e-Patient movement -- I'll explain what that term means. 
Video: [Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down. 
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year. 
Because there is a basic paradox: no one can have an inauthentic experience, but no business can supply one. 
(Laughter) But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48. 
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator. 
An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex, will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time, if they've lost control of their arm. 
But that doesn't really make you fluent. 
Even this problem, too complicated. 
The white here are countries which cannot be classified, because one religion does not reach 50 percent or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason. 
CSP produces a lot of waste heat. 
Some people would say that Islam means submission. 
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different. 
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. 
And I said, no, you really ought to study brains. They said, oh, you know, you're wrong. And I said, no, you're wrong, and I didn't get in. 
He wrote down a simple thing. 
And of that stuff, what do you actually use? 
You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help. 
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt. 
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties, so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made, let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. 
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. 
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth that's prevalent in business now. 
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future, and perhaps the world's future overall. 
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old, no one really knows, but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now. 
(Laughter) "It was the clearest I could find. 
We looked at their desire to cooperate. 
About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, "My life sucks." 
And in many other countries this is happening. 
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is. 
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers. 
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. 
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. 
People like Mahmoud are agents of change. 
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month? 
Governments are not changing it. Why? 
There's one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad, and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs. 
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about. 
And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. 
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to. 
It's so unpredictable and so fragile. 
So, take a look. 
Oh, well, your earrings, I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. 
We need a radically different approach. 
And so that's why I think, personally, that toys can change the world. 
That reminds me, I must post that letter." 
Now this was being broadcast live. 
The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further, it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor. 
It was a really extraordinary moment. 
And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected. 
Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. 
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this. 
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits, or Germans, or South Africans, but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic, and more, you know, enjoyable. 
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. 
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine, blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day. 
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails. 
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable. 
So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet -- you, me, everybody -- would be really good at making these trade-offs. 
It looks like I've paused the program. 
So, they did their work with kittens, with different kinds of deprivation regiments, and those studies, which date back to the '60s, are now being applied to human children. 
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. 
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. 
Mark Riccobono: Yes. 
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose. 
So, this is frozen water. 
So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues. Right? 
It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much, and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience, still found it in himself to try to protect me. 
We were hungry. 
But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother. 
In India in 1960, there was a 24 percent child mortality rate, lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate. 
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there. 
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you. 
The rain occurs, these are summer rains. 
So, we have to work out who influences problems. 
We are in excellent company. 
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available. 
And then finally you're able to get that structure out. 
In the last Olympics, this gentleman, who had several world records in the Special Olympics, tried to run in the normal Olympics. 
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls, and as I approached her, she looked at me, and I sat down. 
I could accept that. 
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them. 
This particular Moai, these five ladies have been together for 97 years. 
Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using. 
When I got there, we had zero happy customers. 
So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier. 
Of course, the left wants to take action, but the right denies that there's any problem. 
When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. 
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer, who is someone who pretends to be a real magician. (Laughter) Now, how do we go about that sort of thing? 
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere, so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off, that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. 
I can actually visualize my future approaching. 
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. 
That won't do. 
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. 
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology. 
(Laughter) Yeah, good. 
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. 
Testing in humans is around the corner. 
People tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets," and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood. 
It's a great place to start if you have questions. 
SW: Very good. 
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. 
(Laughter) And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip. 
It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet. 
You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people, you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically. 
So we looked at this engine, and this had some potential. 
There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. 
Hope is here. Yes we can. 
If you raise questions about that formulation, you really are considered a bit of an antique. 
(Laughter) "I love how I feel today." 
And then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found. 
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough, the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. 
(Laughter) I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one. 
Crowd: Whoa! 
So here's how it looks. Look at the region there. 
How did this happen? 
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions? 
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs. 
"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi, and his colleagues had no answer. 
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know. 
For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:" "The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours, till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself." 
We're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years. 
And I'm going to name one more revolution, and this is the revolution in brain sciences, which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions. 
It's true. 
But before I get to that, I want to address something that you may be wondering about. 
Because we've answered the question we started out with. 
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening, she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. 
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change. 
So, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. 
And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate, and actually have three or four days' warning. 
Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses, so that it could be used for storm water management, for example, by using surface lakes and retention ponds, that created neighborhood amenities, places of recreation, and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. 
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true. 
But, how far away is it? 
This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede. 
as evidence of how low our behavior can sink, rather than how high our standards have risen. 
Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please. 
Think about those oldest living things on Earth, but in a cosmic proportion. 
So about a hundred years ago, some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells. 
So, for my daughter's sake, I thank you for your ideas worth spreading. 
Usually -- one hopes -- innocently, but misrepresented evidence. 
And that's what he saw. (Laughter) You'll notice, which was also in my test report, all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side, which means that the shooter's face would have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit. 
We will observe this day. 
What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs. 
The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps — the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling. 
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice. 
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. 
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land, but my head was down there, underwater. 
But in the second session, they admitted already that they would never do this, what they are doing in these other countries, here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on. 
It's funded by foundations. 
All the movements stopped at falsifying. 
Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. 
So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math, and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world, a more quantitative world than we ever have had. 
There is a problem with community meetings. 
You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems. 
It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. 
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. 
In fact," he says, "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme. 
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation." 
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course. 
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night, the phone rings and it's The New York Times. 
A player in a game called "Project Entropia" actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars. 
So, starting in the mid-'70s when conservation was at the fore, we were actually able to start projects which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release 5,000 baby gharial back to the wild. 
In my theory, language evolves in such a way that sounds match, correspond with, the subjective, with the personal, intuitive experience of the listener. 
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right. 
(Laughter) I heard a wide variety of tones. 
The careful testing, retesting, design, are going to open up vistas of understanding, complexities, difficult things. 
Interestingly, it's happened almost entirely without media coverage. 
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill. 
It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle. 
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower, and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. 
Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera. 
But could you go a little further? 
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. 
So a very, very small program designed to get people in front of computers, publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media, ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country. 
There is only one circumstance in which they always, all of them, walk on two legs, and that is when they are wading through water. 
He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way, so we created this shot. 
I've been studying robots ever since. 
So agile is great for stimulating progress, but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core. 
For reversing disease, that’s what it takes, but if you’re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices. 
So what's the meaning of the controls? 
If we can put our anger inside an engine, it can drive us forward, it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power. 
So before I talk about what is, I think, the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi, I want to talk about their shared source. 
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience, spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator? 
Then you've also lied. (Laughter) We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way. 
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books. 
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. 
What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis, what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. 
Seconds after this video was taken, people in Beijing, people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam, people in Washington D.C. were watching this. 
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make, he ever had any regrets. 
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded. 
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it. 
We thought of people as a liability. 
It climbs up to the top, and it falls, and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. 
This meant everything from perfecting the sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush, to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new, revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch: 6,000 calories a day. 
They have strange names: UCLG, United Cities and Local Governments; ICLEI, the International Council for Local Environmental Issues. 
That's another great idea. 
That's because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. 
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships is all I think about, but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies. 
After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years. 
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen. 
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D. 
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it. 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. 
(Applause) PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper. 
So, what is this stuff that we're all consumed by, and bothered by? 
Let me make three important predictions -- you can check this out, time will tell. 
We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time. 
They did it on a scrub board. 
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible. 
(Laughter) I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely. 
So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here. 
So, I'm either really good at faking it, or this particular model seems to work. 
And bring out this graph. 
Can you come back next year and remind us again?" 
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can. 
This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone. 
They'd already picked out a name for her, Barbara, after her grandmother. 
Recording: ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really. 
They could not imagine turning that choice over to another, even though having made that choice made them feel trapped, guilty, angry. 
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what -- well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it. 
And then your cousin says, "Hey cuz, check out this website. 
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses. 
You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned. 
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall. 
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. 
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness," because it works for us each time. 
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you. 
There will be wars; there will be depressions; there will be natural disasters. 
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble. 
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do. 
(Applause) And the one that I did not submit, which I still like, I wanted to use the same phrase. 
But it should be be perfect enough, because nature doesn't do perfect either. 
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom. 
I mean -- and this is funny, it looks funny here. 
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins? 
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin, but they do so in a very particular way. 
We're not even slowing down. 
Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. 
Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box. 
And somehow, from there, I got interested in design. 
Imagine then just two other little changes. 
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable. 
Experience. 
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk. 
It's a norm. It's a social norm. 
But culturally, we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic, and we expect that. 
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. 
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do. 
It feeds the English requirement. 
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that. 
Didn't know I had one." 
And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. 
But the question is, is it good for us? 
It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums. 
Because if we can, maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids." 
He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. 
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us. 
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die, compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again, this is millions of people, happening every day -- women, in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery, so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode, men explode. 
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. 
This is a man who would risk his life on theory. 
And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities. 
Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is. 
You know, these economists, they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow. 
I fell in love with that. 
And we looked around and somebody else said, "Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter) And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh, and we said, "There's a point to that. 
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms. 
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on, but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing. 
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel. 
So we built big models. 
And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. 
And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders. 
I'm going off to build Google Glass. 
The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. 
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters. 
This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn. 
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people. 
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD. 
It was all just gone. 
Maybe the machinery is broken. 
64 becomes 6,400. 
Like Philip Roth, who said, "And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people? 
Well, what's the source of this? 
And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. 
And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute. 
There I was in high school, meeting dancers and acting. 
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago? 
So, you give people lots and lots of different tasks. 
And I believe that's for four reasons. 
And connecting also with the previous talk here, this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working, how the brain is working, and we can do this with very, very high visual quality and very fast resolution. 
But I'm not going to talk about that. 
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful. 
They were all tired of the fighting. 
That's one thing to remember. 
So if I can make an analogy, let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant, and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. 
But he gave me a cup of tea. 
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go to the restaurant. 
The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that's related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line: The brain abhors a vacuum. 
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think, ever attempted on the planet. 
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants, in domestic servitude, and the list can go on. 
And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months. 
And then, the most important thing is, it gives us large math for low cost. 
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. 
And for a moment I was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes? 
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. 
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types, or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here. 
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard, in that it has become, it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the 20th century. 
We were attacking the wrong driver. 
One last example is that recently we, like last summer, we won the competition to design a Nordic national bank. 
NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew. 
There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. 
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands? 
So we put the patient on the MR table. 
Let's start with this. 
It's information. 
You're eating at least 500 grams per year. 
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud, and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist. 
So that's how it all started. 
Next best thing to a video game. 
And there's actually a huge amount of truth here. 
So, to understand this -- and I'm going to stress this -- it's not about the consumer being in retreat. 
Now I'm her competitor for the audience. 
Thank you. 
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things." 
The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. 
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true. 
My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. 
And hope, of course, is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about, which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived. 
So it can't turn the genes on. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly. 
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. 
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you," is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway." 
Same with furniture, it's too utilitarian. 
And that's why what I'm excited about, and what I think is under-reported, is the significance of the rise of online video. 
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?" 
Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please. 
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license. 
We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. 
Their bodies are chopped up with machetes and are supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money -- or so many, many stories people would tell about it. 
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. 
That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children. 
Because they help people share news. 
And you know the reason why, of course. 
Soon after my training, I found myself working first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted by an altogether new reality. 
He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. 
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense and still hold onto their cars, but the reality is that, by and large, what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect, where people simply stop driving as much, and increasingly, more and more people, if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home, give up their cars altogether. 
LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land. 
I said, "Okay, Mama." 
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science -- this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter) And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. 
Now over and over again, people have said, "Let's build bridges," and frankly, I want to do more than that. 
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi, who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. 
But it's one thing to have a concept; it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work. 
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford, of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are, in fact, many? 
The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple: a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. 
Is it worth it to you? 
What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response. 
RB: I should have. 
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984 has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building. 
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg. 
But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. 
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal. 
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference. 
And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. 
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. 
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk. 
But I had this question. 
My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone, which is an underwater microphone, and this is so I can correlate sound and behavior. 
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. 
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us. 
And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. 
When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important -- and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now. 
So this is how it looks, you know, the operating room of the future today. 
This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced. 
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg. 
Now there's no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. 
His name is Norman." (Laughter) Norman! (Laughter) Norman! 
And if you look in that red oval, that shadow was not supposed to be there. 
What possessed me to say this thing? 
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting. 
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave. 
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen. 
It's in the eye of the beholder. 
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation? 
Yeah. 
The same principles, the same dynamics, the same organization is at work in all of these, including us, and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size. 
School dropout rate is up to 70 percent. 
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. 
They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun, and they will be able to spread out in space, because gravity on these objects is weak. 
So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful. 
And what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution. 
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago, and then you created all the stars, and all the planets, and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways. 
This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the '30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it's all going to happen, it's all going to be wonderful. 
And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble, and we make a decision. 
And I want you to help me do that in this next clip. 
This might look familiar. 
I grew up there. I raised my sons there. 
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product, and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do. 
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away. 
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know, I was a biology major before I went into architecture, the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing. 
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas. 
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in." 
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look; and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. 
"Please get FISA right." 
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones. 
Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? 
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. 
Big events in my life, a strange child. 
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store, and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. 
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world. 
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt," how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford, involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3, with an excitement level of high? 
And so, you know, I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs. 
My father worked at this factory," he said. 
It's what we ought to be doing. 
This represents an eight-year time span. 
I'd love to measure the speed of light here. 
I wanted to support them. 
(Music) Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her. 
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. 
The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation? 
We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. 
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand, three-inch diameter, with a single difference. 
We should record it." 
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well. 
Because I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near." 
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center ... 
Broken, fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in 2000, typical Irish weather on a Wednesday -- gray, snot, tears everywhere, ridiculously self-pitying. 
Very few people become professional writers. 
Now this region's very diverse, and every country is unique. 
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED, I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older, on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree. Is that correct? 
And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle. 
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. 
In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face, of which both sides are beautiful. 
Babies flop out, they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. 
It's titled "The Culture of Organs." 
And we've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics. 
SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good. 
Someone's put a brick through the window. 
And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids, driven by algae or by the leaves at the end, by the most, most powerful parts of the plants, by the roots. 
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do. 
Is London a great big whale? 
This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old. 
Basically, we get it out of mines. 
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime, but I don't want to focus on my shows. 
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off." 
But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker. 
We wanted something that was really affordable. 
The first building I built was 20 years ago. 
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century. 
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money. 
I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe, which you are all of course invited to visit. 
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers, guerrilla historians, etc. 
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other." 
This is a three-dimensional machine. 
No water, rocky soil." 
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on. 
So where's the link between these two things? 
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time. 
Illuminating the city was only the beginning. 
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay. 
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up? 
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. 
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. 
In order to have the car seat approved, you need to pass certain federal standards, all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash. 
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I'm delighted to be here. 
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer. 
You have to be kind of smart, and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid, because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. 
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100. 
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere." 
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA. 
It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging. 
In fact, they invite the honey bees through their colors, and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves. 
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. 
These elephant seals cover half an ocean, take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data. 
It's all just soda. That's just one choice." 
The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. 
They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border. 
Think of diversity as giving us options. 
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and, crucially, to respond, completing the cycle. 
Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. 
And then the other thing about this project is, we bring intellectual property, we bring a marketing approach, we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day, what we bring is these values, and these values create a soul for the companies we work with. 
And the robot is moving these instruments around, and powering them, down inside the body. 
You see, this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell, New Mexico. 
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. 
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. 
While we try to manage declining marine populations, the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. 
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. 
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing, and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal, over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs. 
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36, trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. 
Fifteen minutes later -- next question: where is Calcutta? 
Mice are a very good representation. 
Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality. 
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing. 
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney. 
(Laughter) Another, different kind of poem of youth and age. 
But these are people who have been radicalized, because, thanks to the one child policy, they have lost everyone in their next generation. 
The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. 
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. 
And, as you can see, there -- something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses. 
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model. 
In the Veterans' Court -- this was the first of its kind in the United States. 
They can be intercepted, and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions. 
Well one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005. 
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9/11. 
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other. 
And so that’s the message that I had. 
In fact, one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code. 
Let me show you how we do that. 
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street, and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it. 
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases, very, very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects, and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers, can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all. 
And then so, one had to constantly innovate. 
They're called Millennium Development Goals. 
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known. 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. 
They don't have them. 
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers. 
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again. 
She had phenomenal strength. 
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. 
Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man. 
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder, which I try not to let the security people see at airports. 
It's a serious gene. 
I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro-Turkish superpower. 
For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five, it's down by 2.65 million a year. 
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification. 
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster. 
Let's look at neurons. 
It places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers. 
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year. 
It lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise. 
Be prepared to be good neighbors. 
But we're excited in our company; we're motivated. 
And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream. 
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. 
Only 60 years later, it travels at 80 percent of the speed of sound, and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust. 
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share, and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value, his animated, empathetic action in every moment. 
in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas. 
When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity. 
(Laughter) DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020? 
And he had nine days to make it. 
That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people, or that women should be subordinate to men, or that the Church was the official word of God. 
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. 
and queen of hearts. Yes! 
Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined. 
You express yourself because you have compassion. 
Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend? 
I mean, if there's stuff on Google, why would you need to stuff it into your head? 
And people could never get their bags up it. 
And hold onto this. Good luck to you. 
And literally with only those two inputs -- so, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error, from minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder. 
The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what. 
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land. 
RSW: No. What did he say? 
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. 
These are the people I want to talk about to you today. 
(Laughter) It's unpredictable -- (Music) (Laughter) like this odd country road. 
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. 
They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II. 
You get a mouth. 
So we described these as cool boots. 
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. 
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. 
Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. 
There are eight children in the family. 
And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment, and she called out to me, and she was in bed. 
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training, art history training, because he feared that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just classified things rather than looking at them, and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary, and he wanted us to use our eyes, and he was especially evangelical about this message, because he was losing his sight. 
You can do it with threats of coercion, "sticks," you can do it with payments, "carrots," or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. 
This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram. 
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years, why don't we know about them? 
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine. 
The city actually approached us. 
What would we find out about them? About us? 
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories: active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair, transparent economic development and provisioning of services. 
And so I decided to put him in a depression. 
And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs, the action should in some sense be optimal. 
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. 
Unlike fins and blues, which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans, the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds, so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency, broader-band and more complicated. 
It gives you the kick out of taking risks. 
DR: I like that word. 
All of those are gone. 
Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. 
Some part of you is cold, and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm, or even to be cold. 
You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision. 
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound. 
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof, peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced, come back and pay the five dollars admission. 
That percentage, by the way, is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France. 
And let me take you back 100 years to 1912. 
This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon, this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery. 
Here you can see that knife went through the heart. 
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time. 
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. 
The animal's clearly in the nursing home. 
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury, and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much. 
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. 
For example, they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. 
And so I had this T.V. show. 
Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization, and you receive résumés, and you decide to find more information about the candidates. 
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. 
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox, and we find that this toolbox is very extensive. 
Now, I want to tell you a quick story. 
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK? 
We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments. 
But I will do a trial. 
You saw the spray going in. 
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture. 
You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it. 
That's worse than not having him here at all." 
But when I got there, I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. 
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. 
Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes, you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. 
Second, the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque, with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved. 
Now we're at 1.3. 
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA. 
As we try to build this view, and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture, the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers: numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions, in the billions and now in the trillions. 
The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere. 
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?" 
Thank you. 
So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly. 
Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. 
It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk, because it just came from an early pregnant mouse. 
And in exchange, women have offered fidelity, or at least a promise of fidelity. 
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. 
And you could look at this art and you could, of course, see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being. 
Now we've talked about augmenting the patient, to some degree. 
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing, fin lights. 
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie. 
And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels. 
And we're getting there. 
I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. 
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy. 
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this. 
You are a very, very, very bad person. 
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly. 
And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and, in fact, I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns, and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda, and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday, this one isn't quite so good. 
And very, very difficult times. 
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for. 
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. 
That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of Europe's energy supply. 
What do investors get? 
It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. 
Now why are people using it? 
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder, it's going to be with me. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, this is exactly what I did. 
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. 
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago. 
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy. 
1996: less than one million new university students in China per year; 2006: over five million. 
Because -- notice the porch here. 
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company, right when it launched, and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. 
She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. 
You're not just going to have that, So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell, so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it, there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter) And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!" 
Yes, you totally reversed your security policy. 
He's moved from London to New England, over in America. 
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps. 
And of course, that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime, so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal, because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits, because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand. 
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself. 
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent. 
That was like, we considered that super cool. 
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone, in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a coincidence. 
You can kind of do anything. 
It's a self-induced poison. 
In 2030, we’ll reach the peak. 
But consider the following: if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone, which are shared by everyone. 
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster, comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same. 
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded in a network of relationships. 
There was the local grocer there -- a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. 
So, the bladder is one such organ. 
And we are last place in so many things -- for example, social factors. 
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either, because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about, or even wish to. 
(Laughter) And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall, or when the audience had to hush up, because you can now hear every single detail. 
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu. 
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. 
So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. 
They need your empathy. 
So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world. 
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery. 
And if we remove the mystery of life, then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live, and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are. 
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property." 
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong. 
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. 
He had a pretty low-wage job. 
The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us. 
For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite what you might see on TV, these adaptations, and the detection of them, are fundamentally human. 
And my father was a soldier, and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher. 
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure. 
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data. 
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing? 
And I can tell you two great stories. 
And when we come together and work as one, we can achieve extraordinary things. 
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. 
I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart. 
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities? 
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends, and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl. 
And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation: that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done, they wouldn't have really understood it. 
Up there is the skeleton, which is actually what it's trying to do. 
(Laughter) This woman -- during the Biafran war, we were caught in the war. 
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense. 
In Meteor Crater it was made of metal, and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground. 
But all they had were big dinosaurs. 
We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1 is a prime number. 
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life? 
It even did that in the European empires. 
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy? 
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them. 
Now here's what does work: personalized information works. 
And this is an example of this paradigm shift. 
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought, "He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people." 
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty. 
Have they got something hidden under their clothing? What's going to happen?" 
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. 
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. 
I think novelists put this best. 
The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop. 
This disease was terrifying. 
The book about it comes out in April. 
This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life. 
And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us, and we started. We started to plant, and this first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less, and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again. 
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. 
And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. 
And, in fact, I started painting on anything, and started sending them around town. 
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do: that of rebuilding a life. 
And it faces into a park. 
So ill equipped are we all, to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims." 
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society, our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide, thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal, longwall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shale, deep ocean Arctic drilling. 
Her former name was Fay Wray, and so that was -- I didn't have the wit to say, "Take the painting." 
Me being me, I put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet. 
It's got a built-in flashlight. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time. 
It will say a lot of things. 
And remember, my first patient who came in -- (Applause) -- thank you. (Applause) My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror, and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom." 
This picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning. 
So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over, but which now is rapidly unfreezing. 
We had some court cases. 
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries? 
So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell, if the surgeon could really tell, whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field? 
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx. 
And, once again, I got an extraordinary education, and it was the first time, really, that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries, and these human rights stories became very physical, and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably. 
Because we can imagine, in essence, continuing on. 
And what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician." 
So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people. 
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department. 
This disease appears first as tumors, usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. 
We'd like to know these things. 
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. 
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. 
And I'll show you the last picture. 
(Laughter) "Don't use big words." 
And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. 
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us. 
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. 
Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;M. 
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing. 
Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events. 
On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet. 
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement. 
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up, because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer, and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well, in the beginning. 
So that was what happened when we had a couple of -- that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK -- (Laughter) -- they don't like each other. So there's a different robot. 
And those Post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains. 
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons. 
This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed. 
(Laughter) Here's another really bad one. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
We're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses. 
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. 
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are, I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. 
The second thing is tools for collaboration, be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right? 
(Laughter) So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines. 
The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the 12th of January in 2010. 
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. 
Some pay the price for it. 
He just started to create that dance himself. 
And if I had my druthers, we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards. 
You can say some of this is education. 
There is a particular way of knowing. 
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality. 
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house. 
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens. 
Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities, unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients, and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google. 
All of these things could conceivably be done, and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done. 
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is, but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it, and it maps it and it makes it public. 
PH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits. 
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. 
And that's where they do their experiments, and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down. 
But this was transformative. Really transformative. 
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered. 
They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology. 
And it's because of what we feed them. 
If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. 
Wars persist. Power persists. 
Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a "lifestyle choice." 
Now, the one time I was in the shed, and my mother suspected something, thinking I was at school. 
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you spend all that time imagining that conception, you're not going to listen to me. 
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity. 
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices, and you really have to get above that. 
But the current rovers cannot get there. 
The goal is to control cancer. 
This is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert." 
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety. 
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease. 
And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says "Boardwalk." 
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and, it would seem, common sense, and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. 
Suddenly, they started fighting. 
Only months later, I discover who he really was. 
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one. 
So, we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. 
And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon, that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust. 
And so some really nice things came together. 
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong. 
Video: Goodbye. 
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what's outside. 
We need to see beyond the surface. 
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground. 
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. 
It's way more energetic. 
Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so -- (Laughter) -- Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. 
And there on the smaller scale, the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument, was a materiality and a soulfulness. 
The first one is the Engels coefficient, which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade, in terms of family income, to about 37-some percent. 
That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals." 
It includes 330 compasses. 
Pretty good. And at school? 
And this is very difficult to do because of our structures. 
People want to customize their lives. 
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed. 
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey: a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place, to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet, and we, living on it, came to be. 
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. 
And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. 
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body, it would connect two little pieces of copper tape, and it would make a sound, and the next sound, and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. 
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates 29 cents in health care costs." 
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach. 
And this is what it is. 
Always, all the data shows it's the same, despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently. 
(Laughter) AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. 
So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing, to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready. 
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip. 
Here is an M.S. patient. 
And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says, "You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. 
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass. 
And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway, and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles, going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word. 
And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. 
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant. 
And, kind of as a way of surviving, I would go into my own very personal space, and I would make things. 
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
But I'm 52 years old, and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol. 
I pull myself up into the branches, and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder. 
At the species level, it's been estimated that insect-based pollination, bees pollinating fruit and so on, is something like 190 billion dollars-worth. 
Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated, as we have seen at Copenhagen. 
So for example, if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand, you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. 
Third, they are often creating markets. 
No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years, but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men's circle for 18 years. 
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me." 
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life. 
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. 
Transport, we don't need oil anymore." 
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. 
Thank you. 
And part of that activity is honesty. 
And now, using a series of three cameras, we can detect if a driver is looking forward, looking away, looking down, on the phone, or having a cup of coffee. 
Why? Because they will not reject. 
Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. 
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. 
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. 
So we took a look at another idea. 
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated. 
And most security decisions have a variety of people involved. 
I looked at it. I was really surprised. 
So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost, one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio. 
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book. 
So this led full circle, in a strange way, to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface: the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it. 
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to. 
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm, but also with very much the feeling realm. 
It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. 
I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology, and this inspired a shift in my mindset, from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. 
So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. 
It's everywhere. 
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. 
And with this science, we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts. 
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.

I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne. 
But this one's kind of cool. 
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars. 
And the difference in the two is 16 days.

You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?" 
And what is the impact? 
Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. 
So we need a plan that adds up, and I've described for you six big levers, and we need big action because we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels, and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers. 
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale. 
Our idea for the bid was 100 percent solar cooling, based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia, we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems. 
And it's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end, it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other. 
Take any African economy.

Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received, the more their brain produced oxytocin, and the more oxytocin on board, the more money they returned. 
However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts, there will be some drawbacks. 
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows? 
Okay, you simply wouldn't. 
DR: Ma, he's walking. 
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums. 
I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around. 
And they climb up for their work. 
By understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. 
We respond to stories more than data. 
Both countries are in Asia. 
Through constant experimentation with materials, they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today, eventually resulting in, of course, the legendary lounge chair. 
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly. 
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. 
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one. 
Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in. 
(Applause) We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains, because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers." 
They do it to make a profit. 
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days. 
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.

I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it, the malleability of it, and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself. 
That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly. 
We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier. 
Well, there are other ways of making a flap. 
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar. 
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people. 
We need to put this better market feedback. 
Can you say "raw"? 
In this vein, we can increase economic growth. 
So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. 
Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in 2010? 
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms -- that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer -- but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel. 
And it's everywhere. 
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest. 
This shape is of an extraordinary complication. 
I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer. 
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong -- our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect -- this is the reason. 
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. 
You understand the full scope of the project. 
But anyway, the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was -- there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. 
This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste, what ends up in the garbage, what ends up in supermarket bins, what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two, and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. 
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid, very little prospect of getting a job -- what economic activity could she theoretically engage in? 
And in mine, I hope. 
This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments. 
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting? 
And so, if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too, but we can reject all that. 
It's very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people, you split them in half, you treat one group one way, you treat the other group the other way, and a little while later, you follow them up and see what happened to each of them. 
Now, what do I mean by well motivated? 
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her, "Of Mice and Men" style. 
I would go into these private places, and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects -- and sort of learning how to speak with my hands. 
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth, and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously, is completely constructed. 
But he told me that after 9/11, he began to have second thoughts. 
And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there. 
The reason they went on studying was this. 
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. 
(Applause) I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. 
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics, which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music. 
Recording: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ I'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ It can't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ I can't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ But you'll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ AK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds, that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. 
So if you dig below the headlines, though, you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press, far ahead of the politicians. 
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. 
(Laughter) For even in my own life, there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird, that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. 
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc. 
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution, of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton. 
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Video: Woof! 
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine. 
They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. 
And if we don't pay attention to it, it could be a real problem. 
And why is he building a thing like this? 
But there's another problem which goes along with this -- that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. 
(Applause) So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. 
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion. 
There are things that are intrinsically wrong -- like lying is wrong, like torturing innocent children is wrong. 
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. 
But before we go through that process of divergence, there is actually quite an important first step. 
Anticipation made them happy. 
The answer is yes, and for the first time, it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples. 
We're working on also simpler technology, not that complex, with younger people and also older people, like this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter) So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape-shifting hull. 
I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and, I believe, cause a revolution in manufacturing. 
Take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message. 
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex." 
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels, who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before. 
(Laughter) So the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade. 
The song is just a given. 
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. 
So, he decided to give it a try, to start this artificial biology going in the machines. 
So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim, who wanted to teach us about this. 
But of course we're not done yet. 
It's a simple formula: eat food. 
So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem. 
In 1994, when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum, I made an exhibition called Black Male. 
And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning, let's say one or two people are infected, or affected by the thing and then they affect, or infect, two people, who in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth, and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve. 
At InteraXon, intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates. 
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it. 
And when I had this thought, I was imagining that I would make -- I would have a whole machine theater evening, where I would -- you would have an audience, the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. 
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster, more convenient way to get information in the real world, but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible. 
Personally, I really didn't know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task. 
Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. 
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. 
They trust their ears. 
As you get further and further away from the pump, the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. 
So we live in the boonies. 
But if you can do it any time, that means you can do it tomorrow, and if you can do it tomorrow, well, you may not ever get around to it. (Laughter) So we brought back the innovation of having due dates. (Laughter) You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week, but at the end of the week, you had to get the homework done. 
They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive. 
She was in her grandmother's backyard, and she saw something that made her break down in tears. 
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. 
And they both laughed. 
There's none of what is called the "chemo head." 
They want to figure out how things work, and they want to do it in groups, like this hackers club in Washington, D.C., that uses our materials to offer community courses. 
Germans occupied Russia. 
You know, the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. 
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk, and tell their story. 
And also, the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. 
And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story. 
That's what we all need to do. 
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard. 
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is, and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much, I think we have a real risk of instability. 
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates, because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial. 
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. 
And then it's time to do it again. Last year. 
You heard about neuromodulators earlier. 
Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps. 
(Laughter) It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one. 
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died, she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel. 
So if you think of a map of your country, I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth, you could draw little circles to say, "These are places where good teachers won't go." 
And that includes our own bodies. 
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical. 
Booted up in a cell, the program would execute, and it could result in this person; or with a small change, it could result in this person; or another small change, this person; or with a larger change, this dog, or this tree, or this whale. 
And recently, I was in Easter Island, which is an incredibly beautiful place, and an incredibly mysterious place, because no matter where you go in Easter Island, you're struck by these statues, called the moai. 
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. 
You should get points for doing this on time. 
Something you find is, freedom is weird. 
All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed. 
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time. 
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult. 
And I still feel I'm running, it's just the training to become a long-distance papercutter. 
We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics. 
Which one of these guys am I actually related to? 
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that. 
And there's the fountain. 
It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you. 
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." 
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. 
I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer. 
And the fact is that millions of people do it. 
(Laughter) It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel. 
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. 
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium. 
And the problem with that is that people freak out. 
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down, and then we say, "Perform." 
These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth, and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms. 
I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. 
This little guy has no visible means of self-support. 
So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process, which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. 
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this." 
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold. 
This isn't information. 
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards, even if another person shuffles. 
While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal. 
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring. 
And with this one campaign as our umbrella, my organization, DATA, and other groups, have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. 
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail, with a robot. 
I want to try to combine them all, because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. 
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. 
So, what technology brought, through the very simple tools like these stone tools here -- even something as small as this -- the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived 10,000 years ago. 
PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover, 300 million dollars of profits, 200 million dollars after tax, 94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business. 
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this? 
Many of you may know it by the term tartar. 
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems. 
I actually jumped in and photographed this, and with the fisherman's permission, I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free. 
You re-grow a set of teeth. 
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A. 
One of them told me, "Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea. 
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle, peace, justice and equality, but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. 
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child. 
So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store. 
That's not very good for doctors' business. 
So again, that was a real good match. 
These red dots, these red areas, basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. 
This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients, and especially those with retinal diseases. 
It was a study to specifically ask, what's going on with women? 
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles. 
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. 
You have to have physical structure. 
He was very popular. 
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. 
Because if you really care about income inequality, you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage. 
That's what I do. 
One exception is in Massachusetts. 
As variable as flu is, HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar. 
And the aurochs was like the bison. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's pretty simple stuff. 
Ha. He's ready. 
Now even though we're combining the translations, the site actually can translate pretty fast. 
But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily. 
It just becomes intolerable. 
And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other, it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter. 
Thank you very much. 
Many people, I think, on our planet right now despair, and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. 
While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. 
This sent shivers up my spine. 
We will continue to work within JCC. 
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people -- we might as well get it right. 
So of course, this is a very crude machine, but we're working on a micro-scale version of these, and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. 
Of course, the verdict is not definitive. 
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx. 
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com, what you'll see is the video playing above. 
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat. 
It can only be Jehovah. 
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care, the hire of toys, farm work, hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door, services for tourists, home care. 
In this case, you actually can. 
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem. 
You don't have enough gaming experience. 
I have 13 minutes with each patient. 
And here, I had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry. 
5:10. 
He started a landscaping and design floral company. 
So what's that about? 
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. 
That's very nice about them. 
It's a Necker cube. 
Very often at school, I'd be taking pictures, and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears, and then look at me and say, "Stop." 
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. 
These invisible links that allure, these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us. 
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties, because it carries with it the power of state. 
Countries do not agree, which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective. 
The positive perspective, I think, of all of this is that, if we do understand when we go wrong, if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail, we can actually hope to fix things. 
RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone, the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ... 
Very useful word. So, look at that. 
He really popped their balloon. 
That same sound traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda, and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey -- the same sound. 
There is a dearth of old stars. 
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may. 
So, some very talented people. 
And this is happening in every city around the world. 
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. 
You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human. 
So, doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-living and living systems. 
And I want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now, and your grandchild, or great-grandchild, or niece or nephew or god-child, is looking at this photograph of you. 
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world. 
He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground I wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings," which I thought was quite lovely. 
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative. 
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints. 
(Laughter) But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. 
Why are statisticians not measuring these? 
We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life. 
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States, and it was getting great hits on YouTube. 
Four years ago, 23 African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. 
People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. 
We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives. 
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making. 
A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. 
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active. 
As a result, if you are very, very smart and very, very lucky, you can get very, very rich very, very quickly. 
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement, (Laughter) that is, what distinguishes games from productive activity, (Laughter) it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential." 
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them, how did they transport them? 
Prick a finger, you get some blood, about 50 microliters. 
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. 
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade. 
This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London, who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. 
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down, where the large animals are gone, the corals have not recovered. 
Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile, and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing. 
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. 
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference, you could buy me a Chagall. 
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer. 
So, in science, two false approaches blight progress. 
They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. 
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour. 
Well it turns out that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss, was very enamored of German engineers. 
(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah. 
Now, let me ask you another question. 
It could be tomato sauce, or anything could be dispensed -- sand, powders or anything like that. 
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side. 
Oh, when I was buying the clubs, somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others. 
Went in, paid my ten pesos, walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio. 
So I grab the dove, and for the second time I send her in the air. 
And then you get crazy. 
And she said, "I think you're special." 
The subway was against, of course. 
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one. 
And consider treating psychotic disorders -- and I want this involved with the TED group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans. 
But in my world, it's called reduced obesity and diabetes. 
Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. 
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. 
I knew this, but I was expecting something. 
(Laughter) And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?" 
He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. 
This is me: 60-plus. 
So when my mother used to take me to school, she thought I was at school, and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned, and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. 
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends. 
Momentum has been building. 
It could depend on the nature of the pathogen -- different pathogens, using this technique, you'd get different warning -- or other phenomena that are spreading, or frankly, on the structure of the human network. 
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this. 
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff. 
It's a very slow process. 
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark. 
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, and that was great, and we don't need them anymore, and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially? 
And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you, and teaches you that you're very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in. 
It takes opening your arms, both, wide, and expecting very little love in return, but demanding accountability, and bringing the accountability to the table as well. 
Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there, either you have to fly and land on water, or go by canoe for several days. 
And because we no longer need to use sunlight, we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room. 
What does this world look like? 
SS: You got to pick your height? 
Is television literally functioning as our conscience, tempting us and rewarding us at the same time? 
Now we do the same with drills and machines. 
It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m. 
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years. 
And so even at a young age, that really resonated with me, and the whole notion of environmental preservation, at a very basic level, sunk in with me. 
CA: Janine, thank you so much. 
It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid. 
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement, and hauling poles around. 
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket. 
The first drug for HIV/AIDS was not developed for HIV/AIDS. 
Primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all. 
Here. 
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic. 
That doesn't seem terribly shocking -- although it's controversial for a lot of people -- that we are self-interested. 
We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy, and at the same time protest those who would take our freedom, take place. 
I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future: to these anonymous farmers, that first bred the first wheat varieties; and to the farmers of today, who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are. 
I grew up with family, friends, reading to me, and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading. 
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do -- adjust the world to match their expectation. 
It wasn't this arm-wrestle, but it was a little surprising for the person involved. 
Three thousand years ago, civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile, some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance, smelling of sheep shit, I guess, proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne, "We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you." 
So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean, but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. 
So, if we are -- if we have five person, and I will do a five-handed poker game. 
(Laughter) "Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after." 
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable. 
When we were ancient man — (Laughter) — millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) — we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed, we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel, and we'd go back to normal. Okay. 
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it, but I really wanted to take this issue on. 
And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money. 
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India. 
Quite radical. 
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film. 
18 years ago, I saw a photograph in the paper. 
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after. 
This is what radicals can do with openness. 
We transmit with our technology, not only a single data stream, we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel, at even higher speeds. 
And it frees us all up to do other things -- to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food. 
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. 
I'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time, which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out. 
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again. 
And you might think, well, "Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?" 
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. 
Sylvia's interested in art training. 
Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968. 
So we turn it into flour. 
If dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos. 
And he wrote a story basically saying, well, this is all well and good, but you know what, we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. 
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter. 
You can see: there's the plant. 
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages, using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. 
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great." 
We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem. 
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. 
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're production and marketing. 
It's great, but I was in love. 
Never has this number been so high, but actually this is good news, because what it means is people stop dying. 
It is so important when we're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life. 
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you. 
You can actually see it in surface waters. 
Good news: Chariot's coming. 
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives.

You stand up, and you skim the stone. 
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched, and we're in Laurel Maryland, at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. 
One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant. 
I saw photographs of her, and I thought I wanted to go. 
No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood. 
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool, right, because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue. 
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. 
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot." 
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China. 
All that white coral. 
To me, this is not an information age, it's an age of networked intelligence. 
You know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way. 
And after that -- there's nothing much to say about that. 
We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. 
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next. 
Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch, just consuming -- not producing, not sharing -- and we should say, "No." 
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. 
Well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming -- but that's another discussion. 
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends, and that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact. 
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey, they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. 
And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story. 
Nobody wants to do this. 
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job. 
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. 
And we all look forward to those things. 
We are talking about an accountable society, a society that is fair and just, and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market. 
There's still going to be no audio, but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen. 
(Laughter) But what about this day, this one particular Friday? 
So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. 
10 years ago there, were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard &amp; Poors, Moody's and Fitch's. 
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south, that much I knew, but I was surprised to learn this little fact: Those are not cartographers' lines, like latitude or the borders between nations, they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt, and they change. 
"Shush, watch this." 
(Laughter) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience, say. 
And the nurse takes you into a room, and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby, and you hear none of it. 
Now, a bit of economic history, I think, may be helpful here. 
And if you ask him what he wants to do, he will say, "I want to horsing." 
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors, and finally integrated circuits. 
And my little idea that will do that is sleep. 
So right now, the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains, and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. 
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems. 
I expect that producing ingredients, preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. 
The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life. 
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now. 
It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation; just something that happens, naturally, Things with rules as simple as these can do it. 
Probably not. So, why do I call this a biologically inspired robot? How would it work? 
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake. 
But the picture is changing, coming onto the scene. 
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly. 
The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. 
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have. 
And this is what it looks like. 
So we find some investors, and they pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes, and with those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money, and with those savings, they can pay outcomes. 
We would like it to become a large, collectively generated database of do-it-yourself information on smart materials. 
So get on your knees and repeat it." 
BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. 
They're the other big generation. 
So focusing on outcomes, not motives, can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.

Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top. 
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set. 
Those are the things to be provided by the business community. 
We choose our own profession, and we choose our own partners. 
Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle; it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. 
Don't I wish. 
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. 
And as an inorganic chemist, my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic, living world and the inorganic, dead world. 
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars. 
She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 
How do you know? 
Central among them are three. 
While you're thinking about that, this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore, a psychologist in England, who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test: How much did they believe in the paranormal, supernatural, angels and so forth. 
Let me conclude with this picture. 
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue, believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. 
(Laughter) Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s, comes back every summer. 
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car. 
In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. 
And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. 
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building, you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces. 
Scientists like to name things. 
And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems. 
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again. 
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. 
Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. 
So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms. 
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this. 
As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls?

I, for one, was steeped in these. 
So we've got that incredible ramp-up. 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. 
But through this sort of modality, crochet, other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract, high-powered, theoretical ideas, the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics, which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space. 
So they're looking at me really odd. 
It's true. 
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" 
We said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."

I made another game called Train. 
Never having been confronted with this type of situation before, we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource, how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology. 
And the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities. 
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like? 
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved. 
(Applause) I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old. 
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents." 
You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale. 
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series. 
But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there. 
I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic. 
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. 
Both my brother and sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.

Two seconds is like the present. 
It's an Arabic-medium school.

Capital, Malé, where I live. 
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades. 
This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. 
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature, only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on. 
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous. 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. 
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work; it's totally inappropriate. 
But parents tell them, "It will all be washed away by the waves." 
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research, and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops, and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood, and instead, the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s. 
Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus. 
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience. 
Lots of lives are being saved by those. 
He says, "The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. 
They would have been deeply dismayed by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture. 
But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources, we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan. 
Is it who we really are? 
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. 
And those moms bought and prepared food. 
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. 
And the third string is pretty innovative. 
And I personally am obsessed with morality. 
Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food, but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there's human feces on the floor. 
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. 
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years. 
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school, which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. 
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries. 
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place, we think education; that's where we put a lot of money. 
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom. 
So, if you sort of compare that, like this, you'll see that computer versus human -- I've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed. 
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. 
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it? 
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out." 
For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 
We'll then go to the next paradigm. 
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries. 
Maybe it's the ick factor. 
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. 
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. 
And third, through intense reflection, he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure, and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life. 
(Laughter) I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes. 
Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process, but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. 
And we'll wind in the target. 
Texting has a 100 percent open rate. 
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth -- is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know? 
So on the left is the encoder alone, and on the right is from an actual blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer. 
Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these, and if all goes well, 14 years after you started, you will get one approval. 
The last example are solar cells. 
Are you serious about it, and not just, you know, when the consumers want it, when the regulators force us to do it we will go there? 
In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over. 
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look if you -- first, you can't travel this fast, everything would be distorted, but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff. 
(Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing. 
Maybe we're not the right people to do it. 
Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's 2 x 3. 
And just one last thing. 
"You're doing worse." Frown. 
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. 
So what you’re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air, hitting your nose. 
It cannot just be technology, we recognize that. 
Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13? 
He was a middle-class guy. 
This has got to go tomorrow. 
And so there's no way that this is going to work." 
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here. 
(Laughter) I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA. 
Suppose you're the cosmic designer. 
We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men. 
Don't freak out. 
Doing things like I'm doing right now -- traveling to Cannes. 
Most bees don't perceive red. 
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior. 
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. 
Look at these 10 movies. What do they have in common? 
So they're less likely to be randomly false positives, randomly false negatives. 
And indeed, there are now three academic articles in which they've looked at this attraction, which may only last for a second, but it's a definite attraction, and either this same brain region, this reward system, or the chemicals of that reward system are involved. 
(Applause) Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go. 
And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. 
How many Americans? 11. 
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people in Europe and in China. 
This stuff is getting serious enough that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit, we're going to end up losing the dollar. 
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry. 
So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. 
And so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit, ultimately, the ability of individuals to have access, essentially, to pandemic power. 
(Laughter) And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something -- (Laughter) -- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it. 
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website. 
Other than writing a check, what could we do? 
Unlike the smashed glass of my car, plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility, with treatment, to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness. 
And he's standing on the deck of his ship, he's talking to his first mate, and he's saying, "Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks, and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens. 
DK: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. 
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. 
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America. 
It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring. 
But what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010, Movember became a truly global movement. 
The report finished and Abed spoke. 
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. 
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses, that -- it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries, or millennia, in the 20th century were discarded. 
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. 
I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead. 
If you did, it would be because people had carved them. 
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. 
I'll give them one if they want it. 
We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like. 
And that's exactly what he did. 
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics. 
The competition of grasses, right? 
(Spanish) "You don't speak English?" 
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates. 
They usually have about a one degree acceptance angle, meaning once they're more than about a degree off, none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus. 
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. 
So he changed Kaesava's spelling. 
Apartments, etc. 
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion. 
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do. 
But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures, you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures. 
The average American is nearly 20 times richer than the average Chinese by the 1970s. 
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too. 
Then we had some of the world's top economists, eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates, meet in Copenhagen in May 2004. 
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish." 
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean, the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole. 
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery: the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results. 
So he got over to the runway, and he applied the power. 
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big." 
That culprit is business and industry, which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956. 
I imagine an old man crying here, out of the sight of the overseer. 
Now these are controversial questions, and so we tend to shrink from them. 
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too. 
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like. 
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. 
And then of course, as we reached our final destination, a place called Mamancana, we were in for a surprise, because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us. 
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s, 10 years after the Second World War, showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s. 
I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough -- things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there. 
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic. 
(Music) See? He is there 100 percent, but not commanding, not telling what to do. 
If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. 
500 years ago, it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. 
I was not an activist. 
It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen. 
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. 
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion. 
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give, especially if the problem was never going away. 
But think again. Why should that be always the case? 
And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that. 
They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that. 
But that's not the case with real networks. 
In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle. 
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals." 
And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- And you feel it; you see it every day. 
So I went onto Twitter, and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao." 
We have New Year's Eve. 
I propose to explore this idea further, to examine the potential of creating kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. 
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine or some derivative of it. 
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break." 
All around us, still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator. 
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota. 
They give us our identity and a sense of community. 
Oh, and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech, will acquire a human language, whereas the house pet won't, presumably because of some innate different between them. 
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. 
And I realize this is a global forum, but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history, in some places, not all, of American ideas being appropriated, being emulated, for better or for worse, around the world. 
So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis, what can you do? 
But I don't think that we were that way initially. 
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday, the phone rang in the penguin office. 
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times. 
(Applause) What you have here is an electronic cigarette. 
We are always chasing storms. 
It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong, because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. 
We live and work and shop and play in different places. 
(Laughter) (Applause) "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong. 
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. 
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball. 
Growing your own food is like printing your own money. 
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered. 
I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. 
We care what happens in that opera. 
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

(Laughter) They acted silly. 
It's, like, this website. 
You must have gotten your education here." 
And they weren't even being monarchical there, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. 
So why are vultures important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. 
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there. 
So every time you think about moving these people around, you think about high-capacity transportation. 
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. 
The nurse was there. 
We asked the Russians for 40,000. 
We've driven 140,000 miles. 
Now, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children. 
And this was another thing that I felt, while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant, nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation, aesthetic performance into a product. 
This long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change, but without any central coordination. 
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything, but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology, and that is: why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed? 
As I've researched what's going on in the United States, a few interesting little insights have come up. 
If you have a ticket, and you get a ticket for the shade, you pay more, because you're in a more comfortable environment. 
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs and tenacity alone. 
(Laughter) So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it." 
JH: So many forces there. 
After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. 
This is my version of Indian history. 
I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life. 
Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. 
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing. 
I work at a university. 
The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. 
So most of my work, I don't use glue. 
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power. 
I beat out all the Ph.D.'s because I figured that if you treat children like human beings, it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way. 
So if you have the opportunity, please try it out. 
We studied the biota, the ancient biota, the current farming and the protocols. 
You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages. 
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. 
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation, even though these are pretty exciting times because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet, which is great, we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike, which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon. 
In a human being, down in here it could be: make blood cells, start cancer. 
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one. 
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real. 
To get a sense of this, and it's been a theme we've talked about all week, I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners. 
And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. 
They're microbes. They're tiny. 
And you can see the cartoon here. 
(Music) ♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ (Applause) All right. 
So there was always going to be a tension within that. 
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage, only one child had been adopted. 
And this stuff is moving very quickly, and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight. 
So after a while, we could take that out, use it as a lightweight building block. 
My father, who had fought in three wars, could not save his own sister from this suffering. 
The second point I want to make about the favelas is, you've got to open spaces in the favela. 
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world, citizens have self-organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS. 
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features. 
Tigers haven't fared any better -- 45,000 down to maybe 3,000. 
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into is that, if you double the size of the organism, you actually only need 75 percent more energy. 
There's no exchange of ideas between them. 
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ (Applause) The next poem is by E.E. Cummings, "Maggie and Milly and Molly and May." 
Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy, though I think it probably is, it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually. 
Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had? 
You take these particles. You slam them together. 
So, huge tragedy. 
Now today, many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. 
Because people don't have tools to cope with it, to get over it. 
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception. 
This explains most contemporary political debates. 
You know, is it worth trying to get there? 
And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality. 
But finally, the great day arrived. 
There are flash points in India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, in North Korea, other places where the use of nuclear weapons, while initially locally, could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war. 
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right. 
This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves. 
And on land, this cannot work. 
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. 
We failed. 
They are a kind of social capital. 
These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. 
So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet, people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. 
I feel her. 
SW: I think so. 
The means consist of noting something a little technical, ST segment elevation of the electrogram -- translated into English, that means that if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG -- which we call the ST segment -- elevates, that is a sure sign of a heart attack. 
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals. 
And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine -- you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much -- that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball. 
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets. 
Just a few days ago, right across the street from here, there was hundreds of people gathered together. 
We know it takes a lot to make it happen, and we know the direction the world is going in. 
You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. 
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. 
Heart disease, cancer, a car accident? 
We call this the orbiting mode. 
And, I love this story so much. 
And that is what Nick did, up to a point. 
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on. 
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun. 
And this is a perfect square, and it's divided into 14 bits. 
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations, which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism, and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism. 
And on the other hand, it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool. 
Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers, but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations, and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices. 
It's creating electrical patterns. 
We all live in the same planet, but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world. 
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in." 
In 2000, he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2. 
What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see? 
But that's not actually what's happening right now. 
I've tried this in many, many schools. 
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs that their children belong to. 
So what kind of science can we have? 
And even light could not escape this current. 
Victoria? Yes, correct. 
I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties -- not because they were physically unfit. 
When you run very short wavelengths, like a tuning fork the antenna resonates, and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing." 
I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process. 
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around. 
And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on. 
So these are some of the pictures that, in fact, I used when I testified, but more importantly were, to me as a scientist, are those readings, the photometer readings, which I can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye under those circumstances, and from my readings that I recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time, so on and so forth, right, I could predict that there would be no reliable color perception, which is crucial for face recognition, and that there would be only scotopic vision, 
And I'm just going to talk through this animation. 
And the camera is looking down at her. 
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head. 
We've got to change that. 
And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations, what are the externalities? 
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist? 
And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family. 
And then we've gone out into the big outdoors, always with local community consent, always with the necessary permits. 
I mean, they were changing lives. 
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 -- as well as flu B viruses. 
She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. 
And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure -- the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats. 
There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. 
It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. 
But it's not just about people; it's about lifestyles. 
At this moment, I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. 
Language seems to be really important here. 
Let's do the reflection in X first, followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. 
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes. 
They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. 
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. 
For the producers, if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way, that's what brings them to the table. 
Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago, my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said, "Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels -- you gotta get 'em!" 
Let me say that again. 
And in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up, but later in the recording, this kid shows up, and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail. 
The next thing is sodium chloride. 
It's a story about beyond biomimetics, to something I'm calling biomutualism. 
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. 
My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. 
This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night. (Laughter) So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. 
I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. 
And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods, so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them, contain names of merchants. 
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. 
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. 
That won't do at all. 
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves -- as architects, or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings. 
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change. 
And I couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point, even though I'd done a lot of airplane work, on the interiors. 
India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities. 
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks, and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. 
My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. 
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? 
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression. 
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus. 
That little list there would change. 
All problems come back to transportation for me. 
And their love [for studying] was so big that I cried. 
AAA: Thank you. 
(Laughter) But he made this statement. 
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. 
Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that I was never supposed to have. 
Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't, except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. 
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. 
It's what we're going to use in the future. 
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. 
And on top of that, now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps, mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. 
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. 
This is Samantha. 
We have a hard time talking about race, and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation. 
Fantastic, glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. 
And we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing. 
So that is it. 
And also they reference how the uvula -- everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit. 
This is new; this is traditional. 
I looked like a refrigerator. 
I mean, how big is the group overall? 
You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams. 
And we all need to be invested in it. 
We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue, we can get consent to take the tissue within 24 hours of time of death. 
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. 
And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined, even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands, just hiding them in the pockets. 
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. 
Leibniz, the German mathematician, talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria." 
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy, a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere. 
And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her. 
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. 
A student, a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee, perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes; a teacher passes and chides her, "Be careful, you might fall," almost banteringly chides her, "You might fall," and the young woman, 18, a girl really, though she wouldn't think that, as brilliant as she is, first in her class, and "Beautiful, too," she's often told, smiles back, and leans into the open window, which wouldn't even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") -- 
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from. 
They have professional videographers on staff. 
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black, save for a small lightbulb or a fire. 
It was fantastic. 
In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. 
Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other, we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine. 
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule, not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule. 
The climbers got on the southeast ridge. 
That's not true. 
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces. 
We went to Cambridge University, the other university, and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there, a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour. 
The science is clear. 
Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. 
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time, we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence. 
English has a lot of Rs and Ls. 
You all know this story. 
(Laughter) So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age, I didn't make these. 
So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive. 
And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists, did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated. 
So the large baleen whales will produce long, beautiful songs, which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females, both to find one another and to select a mate. 
And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better. 
HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation, and let's actually make some cool stuff. 
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program, tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things. 
And in the process, none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems. 
But through it all, look for a way to break out, to find a field and subject not yet popular. 
And that was what I did. 
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. 
I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge. 
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. 
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link, between one organization and another one. 
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself. 
He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down. 
But all that was about to change. 
It's all government research dollars, and very few of those. 
Where there is no trust, the music quite simply withers away. 
The Q&amp;A session after a post-op presents data is often a blood bath. 
And this hasn't just happened. 
The orange slice is what's discretionary. 
They're very well taken care of. 
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that. 
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons. 
And the question is: are going to look like in 2050, or is it going to be this? 
I work with children all over the world, and that's an entirely different talk, but I want to leave you with one story that really, really inspired me. 
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension. 
Here's this resource that we're looking to save, and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. 
One thing that I've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my little talk, and that is other people. 
Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek, but they should have the chance to do it. 
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. 
And, as a scientist, I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings -- too much information, professor. 
It happens when I dance, when I'm acting. 
I sometimes push too hard. 
Who were these people who came before? 
So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories save oil and coal, and also natural gas that can displace both of them. 
And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore. 
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it, as it's now the most represented language on the internet. 
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. 
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown. 
Here, the animal gets its food reward. 
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. 
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions, are universal phenomena, it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others. 
But what about if we just change that story? 
It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. 
It attracted 42,000 people, and we showcased 51 films. 
(Laughter) So the best editing gives us a bit of both. 
But that sounds really techie. 
That's what it's about. 
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration, it could be a hospital. 
He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him. 
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. 
And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he'd written the letter. 
What about bigger numbers? 
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 70 percent of the people are illiterate. 
It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us. 
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that." 
For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism. 
Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression." 
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. 
So I really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression. 
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. 
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world. 
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey. 
And now I love languages. 
And that connection is change. 
"Kermit means nothing to me." 
You know, one is: just working without pressure. 
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. 
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games. 
Remember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line? 
Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is, and you can see that these signatures are distinct. 
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it. 
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong. 
The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well-designed chair, where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this, and where there is something as conspicuous consumption, where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. 
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. 
We could align ourselves with it. 
(Applause) So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. 
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. 
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits. 
People have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near, so stock up. 
For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. 
For example, you can't post the name of the president, Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name, and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders. 
Well, being different is not that difficult. 
What were these artifacts for? 
And I give you my word, here and now, that we will not cut your sisters either." 
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae. 
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon. 
And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. 
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable. 
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. 
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus. 
Fair enough. 
They snap together like a kid's toy. 
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. 
The architecture is telling a story. 
Therefore, if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing. 
Now, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind? 
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do. 
But we'd also see something very, very surprising. 
That is all aid can be. 
However, I trust that by that day, we shall have passed this present financial calamity. 
The last image we don't have. 
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market, and so they buy it from the Internet. 
Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other, how we care for ourselves -- but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. 
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. 
An identity was defined primarily by religion. 
And then you could decide: "Is this an insect I want to kill, or an insect I don't want to kill?" 
(Laughter) No, they were really big geeks, and they didn't know much about art. 
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive. 
Everything we've described, every artifact or place, will be a specific representation, will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. 
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven. 
(Laughter) (Applause) The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. 
Or if we analyzed our data by sex. 
(Laughter) The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection" A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway, serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. 
The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish. 
Are they saving enough? 
(Laughter) Just a thought. 
So in the 20th century, you had this vicious cycle in the Arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the Islamic-pious, and they're reacting in reactionary ways. 
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object, because they are generally rather nasty. 
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel. 
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest, so too might our subtlest fears be the truest. 
So we have two prototypes. 
Ohhhh. 
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto. 
There is a lot more work we need to do with this. 
What else do we know about the heart? 
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before, since records began. 
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. 
You get a high-level description of the computer program, a high-level description of the origami. 
So in my village now, kids there, they normally listen to BBC, or any radio, and they are waiting to know, the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school. 
Let's face it, we're all on a one-way street, aren't we, and what are we going to do? 
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. 
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small, like this, and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it, kids who didn't want to be outside could do it, and everyone could have access. 
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters. 
And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising, but with a cloud. 
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. 
And I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow." 
It's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old-fashioned style before, and with no golden oldies stations. 
So I was bracing myself for the moment. 
What you do about something which requires quantitative analysis? 
We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. 
I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas. 
An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions. 
In a nutshell that's what happened? 
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. 
In fact, those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent, will note that this is a semi-log plot. 
(Laughter) "Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting." 
And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird. 
Why is it glamorous? 
Lord Curzon once said he saw people bathing in the North Sea, and he said, "Why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have?" 
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. 
I'm telling you this one. 
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West. 
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight? 
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree, it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it. 
It's a cat that lives in trees, and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. 
She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me, and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing. 
And I got home, and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban. 
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater, drinking water, rain water. 
It's called the Great Western Railway. 
And I love to dig a hole. 
We want to make sure that we condition this muscle, so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. 
And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. 
Well, look at Michael Hawley, or look at Dean Kamen, or look at my grandmother. 
So, I'd like to talk about why that is, why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it and, to close with, why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher. 
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince, entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations. 
She's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John's brain as he races around the track. 
We're running out of fossil fuels. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) Imagine, if you will -- a gift. 
So this is a case of actually adapting something, or maybe stealing something, and then turning it into a musical notation. 
What is all this telling us? 
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it? 
Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. 
On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet, the largest carpet company in the world. 
It changed my life. 
But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase. 
Because I was from the United Kingdom, they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children, so they decided to call it hero instead. 
As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. 
They're wrong. 
Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature. 
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom. 
I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as. 
And the fourth and most important, of course, was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart, but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty. 
Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents' full attention. 
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy." 
Well, I tried this device. 
And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them, and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom. 
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then, to run their life processes. 
I propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive, and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. 
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others. 
There's not enough young, healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. 
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime, especially around election time, but the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people, many of whom will lack basic resources. 
And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing. 
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing. 
So here I was in 2008 wondering where I was in my life. 
And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet, but they gradually learn how to move forward, and they do this autonomously. 
But we, actually, back in the early '70s, did surveys, and found that gharial were extremely rare. 
So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love, that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful? 
(Laughter) Til then, I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing. 
In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. 
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. 
It has to totally surrender. 
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop, where instead of bringing in food, we provide digital food, a card. 
And my mum said, "Darling, remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page." 
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?" 
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember. 
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. 
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience. 
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise, but we do it in the lab all the time. 
This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. 
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm. 
The birth is almost complete. 
We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
"You didn't shave.""But sir —" "No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. 
So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin. 
Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. 
I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking. 
There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that there are so many people, so many governments, so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa. 
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there." 
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community. 
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. 
DW: So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake. 
So the trendiest schools in the world, High Tech High and others, they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity. 
So maybe, you know, there's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. 
I think that's the bigger change. 
This is actually in Los Angeles, and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets. 
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands. 
Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. 
Now, why do I say that this is a big problem? 
OK? Stop. All right, now. 
So that was the idea behind this. 
The brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure. 
So now, the thing is that this is a different kind of spell. 
(Applause) So this is actually a new generation. 
And perhaps they knew the future also. 
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain. 
In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded and over 172 men, women and children lost their lives that day. 
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern. 
Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives: the idea is the cause that one believes in; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause -- the propaganda, if you like, of the cause. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, even by the police's admission, this makes not a dent in the profits, really, of the major exporters. 
It basically means to be human and to do the right thing. 
And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us. 
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. 
No vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm, and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter's vehicle. 
And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation -- sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books. 
But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. 
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind, you're a loser. 
What happens is, you take pictures as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky. 
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving? 
When you want the taste that won't weigh you down, the only way to go is up. 
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic. 
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes, proteomics is the study of all the proteins. 
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. 
But I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can. 
Now, where is it? 
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David, and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong. 
This has never been done before. 
Took me six years at MIT, and about that many pages to describe what I was doing, and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker. 
This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case, feels the force and tries to protect its head. 
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. 
So what you’re smelling now is the top note. 
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. 
Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side. 
The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups. 
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected. 
So one day near the end of my journey, I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge." 
And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art. 
They are very hardworking people. 
And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. 
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak, we let him in and he comes in here. 
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough. 
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas? 
So you can click on things and remove it. 
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. 
And they need to have access to all of the trial data. 
And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers. 
But there's not a lot of science behind that number. 
He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used -- Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base. 
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. 
He said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. 
I'm a performer. 
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me: I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask: 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide. 
You can go back all the way to the stone age: technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing, a lot of transportation and communication technologies -- has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non-zero-sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. 
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process, which was incredibly important to them. 
When you come to my website, I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. 
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye. 
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet. 
So we must be good at killing mosquitos. 
We are doing the same with the insurance sector. 
That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power. 
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, "As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world." 
And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific, it's slavery. 
I had somebody count the number of books with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. 
Well it means growing an actual heart, let's say, or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body. 
And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is. 
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line. 
(Applause) Whatever your reason for wanting to do this, whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility -- (Laughter) -- or jobs, or the planet, or your grand-kids, it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win. 
Us. 
When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays. 
In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, and in blue is this area that was deactivated. 
So this building became a permanent building. 
So to unload that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can recline. 
If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream, it's actually buttermilk. 
It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. 
I don't know. As a simple example, we could run a test here. 
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. 
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica. 
But when you start to read the article by Cliff, who himself is a cancer survivor, who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for -- at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life, he makes remarkable points here. 
All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring, and then you can fire at me. 
And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. 
♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫ ♫ Sobule: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫ ♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫ ♫ Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫ ♫ Statue in the park has lost his crown. ♫ ♫ William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Mmm. 
But the goal is to go much further and, very broadly, to democratize all of this knowledge, and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas. 
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay. 
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. 
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall. 
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. 
"Poor countries need aid." 
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. 
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. 
But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money? 
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know, "Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain," so I made this amber waves image. 
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as 2,000 meters deep. 
You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. 
But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel. 
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful. 
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. 
So congratulations. 
But it's a famous picture, not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings, but actually because of a tiny, faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. 
So, while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone. 
(Laughter) Justice. Truth. Communism. 
Or are you more of a down attribute? 
I had the fortune of going to something called a library, and in the library I came upon this very book. 
We will lose to the French, we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese." 
And, using those rules, he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. 
What are you going to contribute? 
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them. 
Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest, or what activities brought you joy. 
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities. 
Capacity: We have 10,000 times more spectrum, 10,000 times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there. 
Why aren't you? 
(Laughter) And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. 
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? 
LG: I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative. 
Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. 
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. 
So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. 
But even more importantly, he created a language, a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows. 
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens. 
Any place you see a differential, there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying exactly the same technology. 
A: What's the next one you want to talk about? 
And when my ritual began, this very voluble patient began to quiet down. 
So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. 
And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. 
We worked from dental molds of Brad. 
Pigs are quite like us. 
(Music) (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody. 
Now, we thought that those data were so powerful in a way, that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life, because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older, you'd be surprised by how social those babies are. 
And when the Web came along, that changed everything, because not only could we find information, we could find other people like ourselves who could gather, who could bring us information. 
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. 
As a nation we have been crippled. 
How do we construct something like this? 
They had put in underground sewer pipes, and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century, waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear. 
They're today's Iranian Jews, still 25,000 of them living in Iran, making them the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. 
Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate. 
This is considered the Five Blessings. 
But within that group, a tiny, smaller group, a minority within a minority within a minority, were coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad, and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden, and he refined the idea. 
We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet. 
I wasn't a citizen of that country. 
Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. 
And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian. 
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye, his nose, the skull bones, the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. 
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market -- my previous book was only for the U.K. market -- that I suppose it could be called humorous. 
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field," the key phrase is "Come to me." 
Now I don't just believe in non-violence. 
And all I can really do is hope, not to policymakers or politicians, because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something, I don't delude myself. 
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right? 
These different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family, so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is. 
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. 
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky. 
I finished my quest, I got the girl. 
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups. 
But here is the sweetener in the deal. 
And the technology is at hand. 
What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important, he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really, really unusual. 
You know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now. 
We'll have spatial computing. 
You say, what's the probability of being caught? 
The protests, the marches, the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights, full stop. 
(Laughter) "Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy! 
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase. 
So, he was like a kid in a candy store. 
(Applause) Nine years ago, I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure. 
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow. 
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time. 
(Laughter) So the first one, it's a very simple game dynamic. 
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact. 
(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that. 
And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint. 
Suppose you like to square numbers, and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter) Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. 
That's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition, which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. 
During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo. 
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them, and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see. 
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow. 
Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them. 
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them, occupy them, invade them and kill them, because they are only obstacles now to your security. 
"Is there a sense of wonder?" 
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school. 
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. 
♫ Should I now stop singing of love, ♫ ♫ now that my memory’s surrounded by blood? ♫ ♫ Sister, why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer? ♫ ♫ So who are they who says, no more love poems now? ♫ ♫ I want to sing a song of love ♫ ♫ for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant ♫ ♫ and still gave birth to a healthy child. ♫ ♫ Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile ♫ ♫ that will ignite my love song, my song of life, ♫ 
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition. 
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government, we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." 
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces. 
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials. 
And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out. 
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick, so he really couldn't tell me what to do next. 
That's not the way to solve problems. 
No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution, One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward. 
He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood, and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community. 
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. 
(Applause) If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?" 
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause. 
But you can see that it's extremely faint. 
It's twilight. 
This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together, pre-going into the textile mills. 
We call this Mission Zero. 
That is the core of who we are and what we do, and we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech, all the things we treasure in our societies. 
And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world where we're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity. 
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in. 
And we call them active galactic nuclei. 
Once they're fully deployed, there's a mechanical lock that goes into place, again, from inside the cockpit. 
And because they're made of natural materials, they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard. 
Getting it over there? 
on a Sunday night. 
And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits, you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. 
We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards. 
And if we are interested, for example, in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth, why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings? 
You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary. 
So we didn't do it. 
He said, "Be you." 
They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. 
Here's the go-kart that we built together. 
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging. 
The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful: 32 meters. 
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal. 
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father. 
Governments aren't very good at telling stories. 
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent. 
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.

It took some diplomacy. 
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance, pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems. 
(Applause) It's not about genes. 
And one month ago we have unveiled it. 
The continental landmasses drifted around. 
This is a typical insulin injection. 
Does that sound improbable to you? 
A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe. 
Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans, each individual frame, it's got a very powerful feeling to it. 
And we learn amity. 
Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual. 
So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did. 
What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds, but that's enough for us to extract her source characteristics. 
It was a beautiful day. 
If it's all puppies, porn and piracy, we're doomed. 
And from there we climb up to Camp Two, which is sort of the foreground. 
There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions. 
This gift came to me about five months ago. 
(Laughter) So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? 
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. 
We intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power, passion and boldness of our students, faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time. 
Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands. 
It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture, and then putting it into a communication system. 
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. 
This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy insecurity, energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe. 
I'm going to build towards complexity now. 
I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. 
And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution. 
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish. 
What's next? 
The color coordination is very important. 
But the visual complexity is still very high. 
And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it, but I had to do it. 
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health. 
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars, there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you one of these SPECT scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems. 
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense -- ideas would get together there. 
It's delicious, it's nutritious, and as I learned when I went to Kashgar, it symbolizes their taboo against food waste. 
All of us are refugees. 
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches just lying around the house, because the mice might get into them and start a fire. 
When it comes to being dexterous, it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous. 
It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's really fast. 
The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that commonality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. 
We'd seen that users had actually modified it. 
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago. 
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by? 
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. 
This looks like a dis-org chart, and yet, out of this community, but using these tools, they can now create something together. 
And we're encouraging others to do it as well. 
The whites could farm, graze and hunt as they wished, but we black, we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife. 
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this, he's not reaching in front and catching the water. 
You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer, and it actually works. 
I'm telling you where I need your help. 
This was a perfect introduction. 
"She took up a more threatening position in her bed." 
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. 
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there. 
Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well. 
Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device. 
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade, he gave me comfort. 
Well I'm trying to take a different approach. 
What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software, and then test them for a few hours. 
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man! 
So I'm a social scientist by training, so why am I here today talking about smart materials? 
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. 
And they fly into the erupting volcano. 
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting. 
Okay. Pretty much everybody. 
We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest, easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. 
That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. 
As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I had an early fascination with first principles, and over the years, as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated, this early awe with the basics has only intensified. 
Boring. It's just not interesting neurally. 
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever, we have plenty of natural gas. 
How many people gave of their time and their expertise, and their patience, to deal with me? 
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. 
And we have new tools. 
We always had hope. 
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time, by using technology in a constructive fashion, you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian -- on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators. 
In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. 
The minute he stops, we have neither. 
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise, are pervasive, and so are the misleading mental images. 
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally, the power is it's done every week for a lifetime. 
And so forth. 
PM: Okay, and let's have the next. 
So actually, check this out. 
(Laughter) It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt, so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them through the treadmill belt, to see how they move. 
And again, we were in for a surprise. 
And he coined this term e-Patients -- equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled. 
It's photophilic. 
You were all over the place. 
Let's see. 
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. 
Our children go to different schools. 
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. 
For this so-called "battle," 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. 
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, "Hey, what about my roof?" 
There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona, there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. 
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way, pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in, you can pull back out. 
That's how the system's supposed to work. 
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue. 
That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. 
These are the manageable problems, so you ignore — (Laughter) (Applause) — so you ignore this corruption. 
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. 
I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it. 
He actually coined the term cymatics. 
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office, I heard other words: "cancer," "stage," "grade." 
Every culture is trying to understand itself: "Why do we exist?" 
He talked about doing it with marbles, having gates and what we now call shift registers, where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks. 
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind. 
When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good. 
We can put in all the meanings. 
And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times, I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now, no matter where I am, even where I know none of the oil has gone, I sort of see slicks, and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. 
OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers, as teachers often think, but actually from common sense, from experience of the world around them, from all the things that go on between them and their peers, and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience. 
There are many people who have helped me in my life, and many that I haven't met. 
So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. 
We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask. 
It's quite free of commercial clutter: you don't see our logos and brands and names, and therefore you're alert to things physically. 
She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before? 
So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. 
You know, incubators for infants, for example. 
Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s, and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in, but these two were the ones that differentiated me. 
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy, and of industrial revolution. 
What shall I talk to her about?" 
After all, what constitutes a world leader? 
And it's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website. 
They then move out to the next one, and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth. 
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else. 
Help WITNESS give cameras to the world. 
And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments. 
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System." 
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. 
It's Africa that already is affected. 
It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves, which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. 
This is known as transitivity in networks. 
It is possible and it is not difficult. 
And we've taken this title of leader, and we treat it as if it's something that one day we're going to deserve, but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with. 
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything. 
And it works in a very particular way. 
And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations, that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster -- emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years. 
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles. 
So that's where Health Leads began. 
And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately, is not very reliable. (Laughter) Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, let me add. Take this example: 
For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway. 
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon. 
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center. 
And I think I was 14. 
(Laughter) The idea is that we can just type this in, this kind of question in, however we think of it. 
While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you, something horrible's going on down here. 
And hope actually is at the heart of this. 
They are shaping the way we consume. 
This is an area of about 50 million hectares. 
(Laughter) And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause. 
Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. 
It permeates their entire life. 
It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. 
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope. 
And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure, and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels. 
Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers. 
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. 
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. 
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. 
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that. 
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties, I would not have liked somebody to say, "This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want." 
You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? 
"We have no freedom," they said. 
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy. 
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E, why can't Keshava be K-A-E? 
In terms of dollars per what's stored, it's simply the best. 
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off, click click, when you closed the door in a car? 
All I need now is to flip on another beam, and the bottom beam is me talking, right? 
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right? 
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children. 
But here and there and that. You know what to do. 
(Applause) Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point, but that's actually more in Switzerland. 
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media. 
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located or distant and distinct, is always important. 
(Laughter) What happened there? 
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals. 
They haven't got them. 
I mean, there's no paper on the desk. 
And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. 
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask. 
It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they've had. 
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact, and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence. 
We cannot expand anymore, because it erodes the planetary boundaries. 
We have all these regions. 
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away, lost in their own reverie. 
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay, heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. 
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. 
Where is that? 
It's not even unique to poor people in India. 
They meet Neanderthals, mix with them, continue to spread over the world, and somewhere in Southeast Asia, they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific. 
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. 
Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons. 
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly. 
And, of course, there's signal processing and digital cameras. 
You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments. 
He began to tap on the chests of his patients, on their abdomens. 
Stretching over a million years, the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history. 
Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. 
They have to, in 2005, have a distinct identity for all their models of cars. 
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing. 
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear. 
You think that social media is about hooking up online? 
Where and how can we draw the line? 
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have, and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are. 
Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years. 
It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure. 
What's the population of the Earth? 
We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense, and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. 
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?" 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. 
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. 
And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes. 
And how many say, no, he doesn't? 
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts, and I had wonderful teachers there, most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch. 
But they answered and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story. 
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together, and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition. 
That's going to spray cells over that area. 
Now, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath, 54 percent had headaches – this is not a healthy way to eat. 
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants. 
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. 
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead." 
They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. 
This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work. 
The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. 
Right now, phones don't go through the Web, but they are beginning to, and they will. 
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable. 
Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. 
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific: "Well, we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing. 
Take a look at these. 
Okay? So this is my point. 
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. 
And there'd also be an extinction event -- like fossils would suddenly disappear. 
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs. 
Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about. 
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen, and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition: he got a cat. 
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right? 
And then this brother -- look at this diagram. 
Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years, and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data. 
It was made in tobacco plants. 
That's one billion media hits. 
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally. 
And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. 
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know. 
Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished, and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim. 
We went back out for the final tour of the farm, and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity. 
(Laughter) So, how do you restore trust? 
Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating. 
So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future, and this is chosen as an example. 
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching. 
You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes. I had all that stuff, and it's gone. 
(Laughter) Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. 
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania, and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it. 
And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now, and some really interesting lessons here. 
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread. 
Her name is Zumra. 
So where do we go now? 
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you. 
So the question is, why is that? 
People are going to be hurt. 
And all over India, at the end of about two years, children were beginning to Google their homework. 
(Laughter) And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings, dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs. 
So this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy, Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay? 
And in fact, if you could do that, what you would see is something like this. 
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV. 
These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live, and their vehicle-miles traveled per day, the amount that each person drives, actually peaked in 1996, has been dropping ever since, and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country. 
And then we have intentions. 
And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about. 
We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. 
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun. 
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. 
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was "Powers of Ten," Charles and Ray Eames' film. 
There's the traditional crafts, We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. 
So he's just explaining something. 
You either use it, or lose it. 
(Laughter) "We're going to find you." 
And there are a lot of other problems with that. It's very hard to do. 
This is a river. 
These people are deceived, forced. 
It's been successful beyond our dreams. 
The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration. 
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them. 
The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd-sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world, and, in a more dramatic case, we've seen in Mexico, a country that has been racked by 50,000 narcotics-related murders in the past six years. 
The first ingredient is materials and geometry, and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source. 
We also have articles called "How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes." 
And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. 
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you. 
So in these two examples, we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation, and also machines that learned how to walk in reality. 
And I think the best way to achieve that, and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out. 
So what does all this mean in practice? 
And you can just imagine them. 
Programmers take this capability for granted. 
I was devastated by this, and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. 
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now. 
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. 
Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense -- (Laughter) -- Revolts at the idea. Common sense. 
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns. 
I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe seamlessly, accurately and in a cost-effective fashion using technology. 
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass. 
If you put their foot under water, they grab on. 
You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive. 
I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture. 
(Laughter) The reality is, in Western countries, quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects. 
And here are the statistics. 
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller. 
In my life, when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition, they eluded me. 
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure. 
We've started in our region. 
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict. 
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. 
Social learning really is visual theft. 
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there. 
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. 
So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. 
I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge. 
And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America." 
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. 
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan. 
Well, you should measure what you care about. 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. 
We're losing a ritual. 
But it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life. 
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond. 
And you hear other people doing the same thing. 
They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else. 
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case. 
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels, one paper towel per person per day, 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used. 
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one. 
And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain. 
They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws, but then they want to beat Milo, where women, they're more nurturing about this. 
We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work, and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better. 
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels. 
And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto, when, in my inbox, 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. 
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology. 
We know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body. 
Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the Atlantic, and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. 
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary. 
In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved, most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production. 
He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. 
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. 
All right. How many of you have told that person they did it? 
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector. 
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. 
So that's what we set out to do. 
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. 
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy? 
Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44. 
So where does that leave us? 
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist, but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. 
So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. 
And well, yeah. 
You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel -- that is, until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism. 
Thank you. (Applause) I want to talk to you about something kind of big. 
But talking can be done in different ways. 
Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium, there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs. 
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? 
And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan. 
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. 
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that? 
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price. 
Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself. 
(Applause) I love the Internet. 
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone, and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. 
(Laughter) "And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment." 
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals. 
One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. 
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. 
There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications, which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works. 
And remember, 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night. 
No -- low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. 
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more. 
It's actually a little bit more precise than that. 
And this is City Hall Park. 
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible. 
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret? 
(Beatboxing) (Laughter) (Applause) But as far as being a performer, I'm also diagnosed bipolar. 
You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail. 
So that's what this figure shows you. 
People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing. 
Well, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment, and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning. 
You've got full attention. 
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. 
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here. 
Now how could that be? 
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. 
So if I have a sense of the space, if I feel that the space is tangible, if I feel there is time, if there is a dimension I could call time, I also feel that I can change the space. 
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet, this is how much land you would need. 
We need to do research. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Okay. 
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff. 
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy. 
I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. 
It's not virginity; it's fecundity. 
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. 
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom. 
There is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be. 
(Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. 
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly, you certainly never will. 
Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. 
That was news to me, and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. 
But if you don't have money, what happens? 
So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain, when you're really designing for generosity. 
In fact, in the United States, whatever you may think of Julian Assange, even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks. 
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil -- and scale it infinity. 
If you wanted to read in 1875 at night, you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp. 
We clearly can. 
So here in this situation, if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye, which is shown in green, and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer, normal tissue can't cut it. 
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,' hidden in the word 'whatever.' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined: as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing, and the shape of the thing. 
They said culture. 
Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. 
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. 
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. 
You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back. 
Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper, which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years. 
These were our own people. 
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks, they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. 
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants. 
But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice? 
But here's what we can say: what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. 
So a crystal that will ring if that happens. 
on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking. 
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks, their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place, and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure. 
And I'd like to share some experience over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability. 
And that's what these brands did. 
They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna -- as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days. 
What pathways through pain, what junctures of vulnerability, what crossings and counterings? 
It still ends up at half a turn. 
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer. 
And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why, she told me that, best she could tell, her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong, but vulnerable too. 
We try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat. 
Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring. 
It's carcinogenic." 
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. 
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time. 
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry. 
At that time, I noticed that corruption, that grand corruption, that systematic corruption, was undermining everything we were trying to do. 
(Laughter) And that's followed by these lines about gay adoption: What is the problem with gay adoption? 
Well, some people say there are oil plumes. 
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum. 
Well, she was shocked. 
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras. 
In infrastructure, let's just take one example. 
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. 
And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night. 
How can you tell? 
But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society. 
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world. 
There can be different ways doing this. 
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris. 
The fear is no longer fear. 
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664. 
So, I look forward to working with the TED community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish, and in collaborating with you, hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality. 
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless, but as a poison, it was the best money could buy, so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands. 
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. 
There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck. 
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle. 
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?" 
One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, "Wow, that looks really cool. 
And it's maturing up to the present time. 
And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals love this country. 
"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?" 
Everybody would like to make people happier. 
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh." 
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets. 
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime. 
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html. 
And the doctor has her sit down, and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate -- which is essentially her exhalation rate, or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. 
(Applause) Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world. 
But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. 
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on, that is actually us? 
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. 
I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. 
You're loved for just being you. 
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction; there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years. 
Our modern Western societies are more complex than before, in this time of migration. 
And I would try to reason with them and say, "Why don't we try something else? 
Part of me is just waiting to let go. 
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications, tomatoes in Tenerife, oranges in Florida, bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year, all being discarded. This is one day's waste from one banana plantation in Ecuador. 
But this is different. 
And for that same amount of time, I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers. 
Others overcome their self at raves. 
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy. 
In the real world, we have people who collaborate; we have people who have to work together, and we have many different displays. 
None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it, but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together, people that work in the entertainment software industry, 
They are not luxuries. 
He thought nature would protect us from their formation. 
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. 
(Laughter) Which isn't a great idea. 
But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli. 
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations. 
And then it gives you an output in 3D space. 
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. 
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. 
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska. 
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages; these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com, can be placed into any kind of media. 
Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road. 
In essence, dancers were challenging each other online to get better; incredible new dance skills were being invented; even the six-year-olds were joining in. 
You see the scar form. 
Art. Just doing art. 
It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level-up. 
Another person walks into the lot, and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon, fully loaded, luxury. 
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this. 
There has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth. 
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. 
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life. 
It's about carving out a space for trees. 
Grab that thumb! 
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it. 
And I thought, there it is again: A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary. 
You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you, because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet. 
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. 
All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. 
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we." 
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities. 
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for. 
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. 
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was. 
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. 
They eventually decided -- not unanimously by any means -- not to include his real name, despite the fact that nearly all media reports did. 
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. 
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age, and we are in its golden summer age right now. 
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves, is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time. 
We're going to have all kinds of implants, drugs that force us to stay awake all the time. 
Mars comes to mind. 
All of the great Disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them, or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them, to celebrate this add-on remix creativity. 
I also planted the bibliotree. 
This actually shows the scaffold. 
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum, I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given. 
You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach. 
I asked about his son. 
And then some yells, "Stop!" 
(Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. 
The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow, and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century. 
At some point something clicked. 
This has been done by an incredible, principled effort by the international community, and, of course, above all, by Bosnians themselves. 
One example is sanitation. 
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. 
He was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools. 
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at -- and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today -- is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming. 
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality. 
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less. 
And what I'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject. 
Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. 
And so he's assembled a group of people. 
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas. 
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred, that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. 
(Laughter) And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method. 
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. 
And then, at night, about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel. 
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce, with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria, and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers. 
And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. 
Thank you very much. 
And the watchmaker turned around and said, "God can see it." 
So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children, provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help? 
Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want, be they momentous occasions or mundane ones. 
In this case it was oilseed. 
But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader, because of this increase in speed. 
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay. 
He used a toaster oven, and he even made his own vortex mixer, based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker. 
Population growth's important, but it's also about how much each person consumes. 
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. 
In 1978, I was working for Time magazine, and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children, children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia, and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over Asia. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus. 
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. 
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. 
And that doesn't seem entirely fair. 
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves, so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots. 
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government. 
(Laughter) I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is, "There is a time when panic is the appropriate response." 
It's kind of like genomics. 
So that was a discovery. 
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves. 
And the question I asked myself is, if I couldn't do that, then who was I? 
There are some very light people, some extremely heavy people, maybe people with a lot of bulk up top. 
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software, and it will go through and it will scan the system, have a look at what its popping up here. 
(Laughter) "We've duplicated errors before." 
And cholera was really the great killer of this period. 
There are also some children who are born without arms, called congenital limb deficiency. 
So once you have gravity, here's this -- increase the speed by something, increase the ship's speed. 
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. 
It's not pleasant. 
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in? 
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. 
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria? 
Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se. 
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold. 
And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce, or in this case, ketchup. 
What that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value. 
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings. 
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli? 
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that. 
Thank you. 
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out. 
They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health, again, free resources, don't waste them. 
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. 
The simple thing, the easy thing, is this: if you're an American citizen, call your representative, call your senator. 
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. 
We need to make the best mathematical models we can, the most consistent ones. 
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you. 
I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. 
I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are, how you need to move, and where you need to go. 
But here's the thing: The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. 
And this is one of the ways we do it, by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there, in order to help protect trees, animals and of course the water sources. 
If you use wind, you guarantee ice will last. 
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. 
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. 
And let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab. 
As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers. 
In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters. 
And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses. 
by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. 
My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten. 
I thought I must tell you this. 
The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers, and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself. 
Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. 
And how are we responsible for this? 
(Music) Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy; if I don't see her, I go crazy. 
Yeah, to actually do this thing -- the actual chariot is made of gold. 
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. 
They're not going to get rid of us. 
I mean, is there something wrong with you?" 
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s? 
The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. 
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem. 
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store. 
He's actually taking his own picture, shot with what's called a camera trap. 
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. 
And Yellowstone National Park, there's more "do not feed the animals" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. 
Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair. 
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. 
They're not very animated. (Laughter) This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter) Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge, let's now move on to technical advancements, because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago, the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate, and that means that I can now take cinema-quality 3D models and place them in the world around me, so I have one over here. 
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply, the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy which, of course, reflects the growth of the economy. 
Now, six and a half years later, over seven million people are using it, contributing over 700,000 posts per day. 
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star, and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion. 
Democracy does not require perfect equality, but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life. 
I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. 
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability. 
And what we've discovered is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen -- analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium -- we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. 
These machines would think they -- these organisms, if they came back to life now -- whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe. 
But, to cut a long story short, I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. 
And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe, and they're very much connected with the history of the universe. 
That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing. 
Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives. 
The small number of simple principles were very, very simple. 
I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss. 
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes, and specifically by hormones. 
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine. 
(Laughter) But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 
And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing. 
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building: every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood. 
Lab Partner: Who was that? 
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. 
We grew up playing— Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally. 
Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. 
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity, which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED: it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. 
We bring the power of a corporation to individuals who add their cars to the network. 
And she turned that audience around on a pin. 
That's its great claim to fame, and I wanted to show it to you, not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England, but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years, what we now call the Enlightenment. 
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh. 
Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling this quick, hot fear, and in that instant, I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell. 
These have been private meetings so far. 
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago, and plants followed several hundred million years later. 
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. 
So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology, to us. 
It's a long way. 
You're also running a civil society. 
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter. 
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting. 
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed, with very large teeth or very large eyes. 
So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. 
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine. 
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. 
Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information. 
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. 
This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one. 
And many of these different genes, we've shown, actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant. 
And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich. 
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies. 
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device. 
I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants! 
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. 
An environmental psychologist told me, "If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface, you'll be more rigid. 
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. 
And everybody's a narrator, because everybody has a story to tell. 
What is this? 
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right. 
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history. 
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering. 
This little girl was interesting; she ate the inside of the marshmallow. 
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. 
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore. 
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, "The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me." 
So this is China, a civilization-state, rather than a nation-state. 
She then, last year, painted this diagram. 
Now I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. 
They saw this actually solving a problem: this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic. 
But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. 
DP: G minor. 
And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray, and he's a preacher -- (Laughter) among other things. 
They're mining blood density levels. 
So think about your pitch as a timeline. 
As you can see, there's me in my early, pre-marriage days with a brown beard, and little Derek concentrating there. 
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation. 
And then we looked at the brain activity. 
Now, if it does not decay biologically, it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process, and this smothers and kills grasses, leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil, releasing carbon. 
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. 
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. 
(Laughter) Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived. 
(Applause) Climate change is already a heavy topic, and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are. 
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. 
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her. 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. 
We landed with 40 kilos. 
That's where his strength lies. 
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. 
The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages. 
But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor, do you trust your mayor?" 
(Laughter) So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you, when you get your passport, it still says what country you were born in. 
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. 
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. 
Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause) But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy." 
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin, the business school professor at the University of Toronto, calls integrative thinking. 
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. 
CA: Thank you. (Applause) In the ocean, what is the common point between oil, plastic and radioactivity? 
This is the sort of 3D data that a machine will read. 
(Laughter) I apologize to the men in the audience. 
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back. 
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys. 
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation. 
My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. 
When you deal with a concept like area -- well, we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn. 
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile, that he has non-genetic ALS. 
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on. 
And I wondered if I could update that game, not just for modern methods, but for the modern me. 
Who doesn't want healthier children? 
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling and character-building experience. 
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight, and it fills the middle portion of the fly, so when a fly hits your windshield, it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at. 
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain. 
Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?" 
But more than a symptom, constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves. 
And a lot of us -- and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers. 
♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫ ♫ They're all the same. ♫ ♫ Nor mouth had nor no mind expressed ♫ ♫ What heart heard of, ghost had guessed: ♫ ♫ It's the blight man was born for, ♫ ♫ It is Margaret that you mourn for ♫ Thank you so much. 
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights, gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. 
We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained. 
And you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees, feels, touches, remembers, loves. 
One day a NASA manager comes into my office, sits down and says, "Can you please tell us, how do we look for life outside Earth?" 
In some it is hot. 
And so the trick is -- unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. 
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. 
(Laughter) And, you know, "Excuse me!" 
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. 
(Laughter) And now we're being penetrated. 
By working together, we can create peace one day. 
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution, and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story, and perhaps SETI will help as well. 
So this is what they were going to do in their trial. 
It solves the same problem, but instead of spending several million pounds, you spend several hundred pounds. 
It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. 
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities, in tiny little hotels, and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. 
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things where the content is actually important for me. 
You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people. 
So one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit. 
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada. 
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning. 
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- (Laughter) -- that turned black? 
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi. 
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. 
Do you cook it? Do you have it served to you? 
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was, and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity, we can move aid, we can vaccinate children. 
They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. 
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think. 
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception, and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. 
From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. 
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. 
It's not just new species: it's new behavior, it's new ecology it's all kind of new things. 
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed. 
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up. 
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. 
Nonetheless, in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago, I decided I would try and do that. 
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display, it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object, a real world object in that. 
I didn't think he knew what he was doing, and he pulled it off. 
And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here, he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep, because there's so many great technologies out there, we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know. 
Sticks? David only has one stick. 
He's another young designer from France who's working -- and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients, especially children, in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty. 
(Laughter) Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence. 
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes. 
Which, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed. 
But there's this shift in how information is flowing online, and it's invisible. 
It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science. 
That's my son, Darius. 
So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said, "Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. 
They were part of the bad guys. 
(Laughter) Now this says, "Note to the viewer: I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history. 
They aren't the same. 
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. 
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. 
So what equations are for physics, complex networks are for the study of complex systems. 
He won by a margin. 
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations. 
And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil. 
So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear] This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube. 
We somehow got to proteins and DNA. 
Now, what happened? 
When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth. 
There are very, very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the Arctic. 
Without needles and radioactivity, without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated." 
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. 
It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed. 
Only 10 minutes off the men's world record, Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. 
The Kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence, and now is their chance to finally have it. 
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
I just thought, and I thought long and hard. 
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. 
What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession. 
This is that rocket going up. 
(Applause) (Laughter) (Music) (Applause) Good evening. 
And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure. 
Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently, absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe. 
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. 
We were up in the mountains, and Feynman said to me, he said, "Leonardo." 
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
Now, there may be some truth to this, because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego. 
So in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said, "Please, you have to make more." 
(Laughter) This is for a book by "Metropolis." 
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage. 
You can tell it's mature bone. 
And what we really found was that alpha, if we think about it, is the organizational structure of the insurgency. 
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep. 
It sounds silly, but I thought, okay, the way the world works can be changed, and it can be changed by me in these small ways. 
It threatens the flow of love. 
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?" 
They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad, and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention. 
The first one is very simple: experience bars measuring progress -- something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. 
And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. 
So no matter how lazy you feel, you're not really intrinsically doing nothing. 
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter, without fundamental learning. 
The service which grew out of this, Dial 1298 for Ambulance, with one ambulance in 2004, now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states, and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception. 
A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density. 
(Laughter) RB: We couldn't find any customers. 
And we see here a photograph with a head. 
I couldn't prove it. 
Turns out that's not cool. 
Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. 
(Applause) All right. 
Thank you. 
This photo was taken two weeks ago. 
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists. 
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. 
They destroy everything. 
And I found myself in front of an HR manager in 1999, saying something I never imagined that I would say. 
The Luminous Room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co-located. 
So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative. 
Because if we can make a profit, we can do it for 10, 100, a million, 100 million, a billion. 
And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem, because it only super-empowers people more. 
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world, throughout the ocean. 
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. 
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else, has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. 
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. 
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. 
The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens, big broadband connections, but in groups. 
Think about that. 
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship -- that are gentle, that are egalitarian. 
We're wired for dangers that are immediate, that are physical, that are imminent, and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in. 
The problem is, there are many, many feet. 
So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle. 
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. 
(Laughter) I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland, and you have to go on talking like this all the time. 
It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code. 
Now, compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa. 
So you put these together. It's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production. 
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. 
Her mother was often told by other women, "You and your child will die poor." 
In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program. 
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center -- on social issues, we're talking about, primarily -- or conservative, and I'll give a third option, because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. 
It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. 
Women are 51 percent of humankind. 
If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero. 
Thank you. 
And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans. 
And finally, to real life-changing applications, such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. 
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. 
And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable. 
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies. 
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. 
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. 
(Laughter) But here's the deal. 
That's Rio. 
Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right. 
You're really a driver or a passenger -- to use a Volkswagen phrase. 
Actually, the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web. 
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening. 
What you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages. 
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. 
Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now, that enables me to find the sources of intimacy, of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now. 
And he's five years old. 
And this is Battista. 
So, you've got a choice: We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck." 
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down. 
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. 
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this: We need to learn to love the flawed, imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them. 
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign, reinvent the airport. 
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. 
And so what we did was, actually, we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. 
So a lot of the pieces that I've made, they involve found objects. 
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional. 
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output. 
And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos, and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. 
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it. 
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. 
Here's one such frustrated scientist, Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove. 
The key that we see, though, is training and then early access. 
Guess where those places are? 
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically, animals sleep and dream, and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams. 
And he said, "Of course I will. 
So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging. 
And the beauty of skateboarding is that, no one guy is the best. In fact, I know this is rotten to say, they're my friends, but a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board. 
In Britain, 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year. 
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes. 
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here. 
This is quite comforting for people like me -- I'm a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation. 
All right. Very significant mark. 
So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies. 
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? 
that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. 
The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive it must be a successful business, but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility. 
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that's associated with language. 
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently. 
And so, I have here what we call the "paradigms." 
The pattern of Main Street USA -- in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal. 
You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful. 
It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report. 
Global warming is a great example. 
But here's how the experiment will go. 
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid, but that's what, you know, science is really good at. 
That's the whole idea. 
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite. 
Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin. 
Without them, humanity cannot survive." 
Things where, you know, a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome. 
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time, you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. 
Look for that kind of stuff. 
It's your birthday present." 
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. 
It's 1964, and we're back at Bell Labs. 
I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs. 
This is the same way we've been producing electricity, the steam turbine idea, for 100 years, and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water, but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. 
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. 
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on. 
I felt empty and full, hot and cold, euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer; it can occupy multiple states at the same time. 
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass. 
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times. 
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks, knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. 
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster. 
But if there is someone here who has an autistic child, or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them, what advice would you give them? 
Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur. 
That sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same, but they're not at all. 
They just don't do that in that industry. 
So, you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. 
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey. 
They've wired them like patients in an ICU. 
This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving, whatever gives us a new way to see, cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language. 
In the setting of prostate cancer, up to 60 percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction. 
ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring, but I've got it, I think, and I'll save that image and send it to you. 
In order to have that machine running, you need lots and lots of people. 
And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things, where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything, and then, at the last minute, they landed. 
He really wants that sargassum. 
But I have a message for the men here. 
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots. 
Thanks very much. 
The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. 
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere. 
We find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on. 
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. 
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers. 
Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing. 
And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. 
That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. 
You find the same thing in Buddhism. 
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106. 
Let me introduce you to my brand new project, "Baroque in Rock," which became a golden disc most recently. 
There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones. 
So you're now about 14 billion years into this. 
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age, and you want to get as high as you possibly can. 
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet. 
And so we can feel unfinished. 
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together. 
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random. 
So forget about retirements if you're young. 
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer. 
But she pauses occasionally and says, "How do you spell that? What year? OK." 
And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor. 
So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world. 
I mean, in America, people buy cars, and they put very little money down. 
And they tried everything they had. 
Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia? 
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get! 
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening. 
Because think of the picture -- not the word, the picture. 
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. 
So very simple things like that, we're trying to learn about basking sharks. 
So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could, and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare. 
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids. 
And I could spend hours talking about them, because they're all kind of heroes. 
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works. 
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy, and at every moment, different partisans saying, "Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse," and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. 
So, we try to test this. 
Woman: They insisted that I was lying. 
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in; yeast puts them together automatically. 
That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert, engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home. 
Thank you. 
It is out in the cold, but it still could have come. 
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. 
Thank you. 
If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the U.S. would look like today. 
But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character? 
But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has. 
The date was February 2000. 
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money. 
(Applause) This is Revolution 2.0. 
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted. 
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity, explaining gravity. 
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape. 
Why are bees doing better in the city? 
Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community, linking and mapping this new social capital market. 
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. 
Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing, or it's only because I'm a girl. 
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty, I was always loved and cared for first, because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. 
Before the war, America had been highly protectionist. 
How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new? 
(Laughter) So he starts to tell them, and he's like, "No, this is very important here. You know, when you're needing these knots, it's going to be, you know, everything's going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be -- you're going to have all this information coming at you, there's going to be organs getting in the way, it's going to be slippery, and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand, you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers." 
And I want to change the story a little bit. 
Zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use, by the hour and by the day, instead of owning their own cars. 
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed, because something horrible has happened to them, then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation, and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones, because they do not want to burden them. 
And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play, but I didn't really understand what it was. 
When compared with the unmarinated chicken, which is what I used as my control, I found that lemon juice worked by far the best, which decreased the carcinogens by about 98 percent. 
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. 
And I says, "Well, try me." 
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over? 
Or, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products. 
This is a drug called reboxetine. 
There's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality, and it's this: with some social goods and practices, when market thinking and market values enter, they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about. 
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this. 
This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero. 
And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this, and you get a little bit downhearted. 
I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to. 
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea. 
I wasn't really a rocket scientist, but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm; whereas now I'm in the mid-West, and it's cold. 
We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic. 
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to, but there’s another place for us to go. 
So we can take these liver structures, which are not going to be used, and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. 
What is the average difference here? 
Two rows from this table of two billion entries. 
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility. 
And it goes all the way over to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons, and they have thousands of hydrogens, and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. 
So, as the climbers came by me, I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. 
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. 
Neither of those approaches is sensible. 
It's extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary. 
You type in your code, but you first test your mic. 
By the time he wrote his third report, he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers. 
Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today? 
And ultimately that adds to their values. 
I was burned very badly. 
Now here's eight centuries of economic growth. 
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data. 
(Applause) I'm a designer and an educator. 
We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting, and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again, and send them home, and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. 
And as you're thinking about this, you might also ask the question: So why a single human species? 
The second, more honest way is to actually fix the model. 
A little over a hundred years ago, people were unaware of viruses, the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. 
A little bit like on this picture here. 
The gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it. 
These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them. 
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. 
So what happens during the Second World War? 
And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands. 
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it. 
It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration. 
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed." 
MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943. 
Doctor: What are their shapes? 
And so concern is where all of this comes from. 
So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing, which is basically, you know, tugging on one end of the fiber, very amenable. 
Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn. 
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. 
And the answer is zilch, exactly zero. 
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar. 
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village. 
And rightly so, in many cases. 
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool. 
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy. 
And she said, "He says he knows who you are, what do you want?" 
And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about 50,000, so we can see this work at big scale. 
IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk. 
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: "intentional evolution," "evolution by design" -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. 
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice. 
These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law. 
Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust. 
It's a lot harder than you might think. 
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual. 
The United Nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments; it's called the language of compact. 
(Applause) What I am always thinking about is what this session is about, which is called simplicity. 
I mean they have much larger vocabulary. 
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye. 
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. 
The nodes in the network are the system's components and the links are given by the interactions. 
It has generated considerable insight in physics, in biology and economics, but not that much in the humanities and in history. 
There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. 
As you can see here on this graph, in blue, these are all other mammals, but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really, really high metabolic rate, and the question is, how can they do that? 
Recently "The Economist" recognized this, but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago, and that's what I've been working on. 
And when she dies, they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity. 
So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill; they're a problem where there's not. 
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair -- an environmental crisis, wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since 1928, and globally, a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. 
They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. 
There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun, if they gain weight and so on. 
And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level. 
He said, "Look, these are the strongest and most able men in the country. 
Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true, things like the standard model of physics: what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. 
And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says, "Man, we've got to soak towels." I said, "What?" 
People who have an existing framework, an economic framework, an engineering framework, feel that actually logic is its own answer. 
But some of you do. 
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology, and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome, the ability to be able to look at a chromosome, to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA, and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code, the A's, C's, G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things, and the cost of doing this, which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, has in the course of the last 10 years 
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. 
And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration, you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking -- and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation. 
Its changes will affect all of humanity. 
That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. 
(Music) (Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation of what it's like. 
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? 
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. 
What you could do is really influence your product now and shape-manipulate your product. 
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm, and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it. 
And you just bring your problems to the page. 
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts. 
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures. 
Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from, that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives, or our own organizations, or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative? 
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes. 
We experience thunder -- thunder, thunder. Think, think, think. 
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility." 
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how. 
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market. 
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities. 
And this is, today, the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. 
And over the past few years, I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. 
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging, but this particular one used vision. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center. 
And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. 
So eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go. 
You think that I'm looking at that? 
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stairs, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway, poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview, I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. 
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently? 
We've done this for a very difficult case, which was for deforestation in China. 
The rest of the scientific community said, "Great idea, Higgsy. 
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. 
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. 
This is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences. 
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories. 
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains. 
And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms, they have been on top of buildings. 
It's a waste product. 
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug." 
If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil. 
Mostly they're worried about each other. 
A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. 
Let's set it to something else. 
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his, the three-year-old comes up with another explanation: He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it, because now it's dirty, on the ground. 
Thank you. 
And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. 
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money. 
And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. 
The problem is, we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. 
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us? 
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil. 
So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. 
Everyone watching. 
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms, to enable people to take risk? 
We're going to zoom in and zoom in. 
So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things. 
So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. 
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing, emergency services, solar energy, so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. 
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to. 
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand. 
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles, there was olives, those little white onions. 
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors. 
Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. 
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. 
To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946. 
It could have survived 150 years of whaling. 
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world, one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations, of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations, the naysayers. 
That was easy. OK. 
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system. 
We want our products in that store." 
That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. 
That's the first thing. 
All the rest were historical. 
(Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. 
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. 
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases, I think. The first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center. 
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual. 
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for 10-and-a-half months. 
(Laughter) Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer. 
But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. 
Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon? 
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night. 
And it's fantastic. 
makes two main points. 
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing. 
(Laughter). 
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. 
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. 
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm, waiting for that worm to stick his head out. 
I had to do that properly. 
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic. 
But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda. 
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write. 
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks, very lightweight -- and we're not carrying much else. 
In a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver," "100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society. 
And then we thought, "How stupid." 
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes -- I guess, except for in this picture. 
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. 
In this article, Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him. 
This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea. 
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil, and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance, but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her, and it led her, as she said, down this path to become an award-winning filmmaker. 
I thought, my career's over. 
And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image. 
I said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?" 
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march outside this very building knew these results. 
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. 
let's say the revenue of Microsoft. 
But I wanted to convey something to you. 
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one. 
So this is a musician, Mike Pope, one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player. 
China, all grown up, going to be a looker! 
Bellwether signs again. 
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine. 
He said he had gotten lost in the storm, collapsed in the snow, and just laid there, unable to move. 
And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons, except via the myth itself. 
OK, now. 
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff. 
And that was completely irrelevant. 
There's the glamour of physics. 
It's not the politics first; it's actually the politics last. 
The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck. 
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big. 
So at the end of the next four years, I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. 
And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. 
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here. 
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" 
(Laughter) And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people. 
He was quite a know-it-all, and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. 
You know, from a romance language. 
It's all very detailed information, and, looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals. 
So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it. 
So there I was, I couldn't speak a word of Korean, and this is the first night I met Hyun-Sook. 
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says, "give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. 
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year, and it's continuing now as well, and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine" had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent. 
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. 
My journalism is about hard core evidence. 
What if it was a security patch? 
So I did some research when I got back, and here's what I found. 
She has an issue with authority. 
Einstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present. 
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige. 
For which many people, even from other parts of the world, are going there to find jobs. 
This is five-year-old Parusharam. 
You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED, and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. 
This is how you reach people. 
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. 
So this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking. 
It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. 
So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. 
Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here. 
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know -- ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo. 
But I gave them the room to just do the thing. 
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. 
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future, or the past. 
So before we can really start to make life, we have to really think about where it came from. 
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months. 
I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them. 
FG: Liquid architecture. 
And the interesting moment now, the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true. 
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified, and you should just carry these relationships around. 
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. 
And now it's got number power. 
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes, and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. 
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. 
(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. 
Not necessarily, no. 
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. 
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. 
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. 
Could this little country, like a startup in a mature industry, be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle-class in China and India? 
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room. 
All these choices involve value judgments and social norms, not objective facts. 
It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. 
It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter) It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. 
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time, to identify the building blocks that successful families have. 
And that is that we live in a competent universe, that we are part of a brilliant planet, and that we are surrounded by genius. 
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize. 
So, organisms have this important history. 
And then one day, I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. 
At first glance, the pounding site seems full of powerful men, but when we look closer, we see some less fortunate working on the fringes, and children too. 
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. 
So to our blueprint, let's attach claws. 
He also told me about the great explorers. 
But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus, even in the dividing cell. 
So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at, but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece, let alone make it across to Canada, I had to take a radical approach. 
So it was pretty interesting stuff. 
I was in Australia, and Belinda had cancer, and I was told she's not going to live very long. 
Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline.

That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline. 
Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet, is now personalized -- different people get different things.

This is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi. 
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial, but studying the jury. 
The problem is they now prefer [the] asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. 
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc. 
But scuba diving, submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that.

That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things. 
They don't have the test scores, and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data. 
How did an illness become an identity? 
So we started retouching photos. 
But then when I discovered the situation in my country, at that time there was so much corruption. 
I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. 
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain. 
Why should we care? 
(Laughter) What about a wolf? 
So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab. 
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating. 
And he grew up essentially in Stage One. 
I would. 
And in fact, one student asked me the other day, "Do they get phantom PMS?" 
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. 
He told me two things. 
And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do. 
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. 
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society, but you are not able to implement those things. 
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality." 
(Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition. 
So, inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment. 
I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. 
How to know? 
You hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean and is not quite as loud. 
These things feel very differently. 
It means greedy. 
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover. 
He was speaking at a dinner, he said, "Wall Street got drunk." 
Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. 
Let me show you a couple of examples here. 
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. 
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford. 
Well, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. 
(Laughter) I liked it. Now, a little more difficult. 
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school. 
And finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. 
When teachers make it, children make it. 
(Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. 
I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well. 
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel, who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii, and he's an expert magician, and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, "Net of Magic." 
Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach, then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions, which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. 
Okay, so there's a lot of things to say about this question. 
(Laughter) But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper. 
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself. 
Something like a service or an experience? 
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."

Now, this tech incorporates three big elements. 
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America, which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools, and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city. 
(Laughter) Yeah, good. Yeah. 
Thank you very much for your time. 
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. 
That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible. 
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.

Look at this. Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing, so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking, so I thought, we have to make multi-story building because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable. 
So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month and we've got about 250,000 books online, counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. 
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential. 
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.

Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio. 
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way. 
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. 
We've given this person a name. 
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our -- many young people think she's still alive. 
An example is Tasmania. 
So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials. 
We usually don't, and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost. 
And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. 
And I began to think, I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input -- as if food and information were similar in some form or shape. 
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it. 
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.

Why not live longer? 
And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years. 
It's a big place. That's all ice. 
What are we going to do about it? 
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. 
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. 
This person studies all the "arghs," from one through eight A's. 
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. 
They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters. 
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them, this is what we would expect. 
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. 
Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance. 
I liked your art, so I went to your website and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories, because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them. 
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. 
The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing that mass architecture is about big -- big buildings and big finance. 
Because every generation thinks we are the final one. 
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn, or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged.

So in every car crash in which at least one person dies, they have information on all of the people. 
(Laughter) "That's cool." 
Thank you so much. 
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. 
Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization, I need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.

The bottom picture is Hitler youth. 
So far, animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease, although you might get a mild case. 
A large fraction of it is in English. 
So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. 
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater; you actually improve. 
So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience. 
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website, there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork, and, yes, interactive Mother's Day cards. 
Get a secure password. 
This is what happens to girls in remote areas. 
On this next slide, is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure, because whether I give you a perfect Skycar, the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you unless you've got a system to use it in. 
Can I be honest? 
So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. 
He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. 
And their wish would then be brought to a priest, who would find a ritual object, and the appropriate sacrifices would be made, and the shrine would be built for the god.

This will be a premiere today. 
The rest -- wider array of partners. 
Even errors were duplicated. 
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer. 
But no harm. You just move away. 
The procedures that make this work have been perfected, as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years. 
Whether this is a personal decision -- whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision -- where you're going to invade some foreign country -- you're going to trade off something, either money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties.

And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers around the world. 
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of what we did, a lot of the secret of our success, was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement. 
One of those is in extreme environments. 
Thanks. 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. 
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites, so on. 
So it continued on for many years after he died. 
And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons. 
At this stage, my grandmother, who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety, started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all. 
So, you can see the duration. 
What do you get then?

What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. 
How do you solve this problem? 
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela. 
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.' I say, 'Let's do this.'" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.

A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
They're not building transmitters. 
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well. 
And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before, or characters that we've just never seen before. 
Again, similar story around the world. 
Or this could represent a college green. 
People with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart, they're actually sometimes quite helpless. 
So this is a time of great change.

The challenge, of course, is to answer this question: what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere? 
Instead of turning to friends or relatives, they looked to David's workplace. 
(Applause) PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet. 
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.

You will know what this person is doing, whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information. 
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction.

So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. 
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos. 
To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.

Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
I can help you with those later. 
(Applause) So if you were in Palm Springs ... 
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine. 
These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. 
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer. 
FG: I don't know. 
What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. 
Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. 
That's what progress is about. 
Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being? 
He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile. 
And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often, and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.

But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there. 
And as we get farther away, the sound gets fainter and fainter. 
I was curious about this, so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders, and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. 
Again, another medical example here. 
For the first time in history, most people live in cities, and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years, the population is going to double on the planet. 
In addition to these complexities, I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. 
Gone very fast, disappeared. 
I get it. 
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google. 
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble. 
(Applause) It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. 
But how could the crowd become synchronized? 
You know, this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight-year-old can use. 
No problem. Yeah, you know." 
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward. 
But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long. 
There are thousands of trees. 
They take the poorest kids, and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges. 
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. 
It basically organizes itself." 
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation. 
It's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool. 
So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests, which is further the moral evolution, then they could actually have a constructive effect. 
Sina.com, a major news portal, alone has more than 140 million microbloggers. 
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. 
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s. 
We can make them; we have that technology. 
Or you could spray. 
We think we're onto something. 
I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet. 
Now, these are three spectragrams. 
And it's been the same in every single room, in every town that we've ever told our story. 
Totally ineffective. 
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence. 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack." 
That is the politics of the 21st century, and in a way, Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation, that change, that is happening to all of us. 
I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person. 
For example: mental arithmetic. 
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that. 
And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center, where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. 
And any infrastructure you look at -- whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way. 
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment, and let's think of what could happen if we could do that. 
We are now children of the French Enlightenment. 
Put it on four plates. 
So a simple idea, which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world. 
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi. 
Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades. 
In 1947, there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85. 
And so this is a photograph from the 1950s. 
You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done. 
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course. 
Sometimes they assume I am deaf. 
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? 
And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists. 
Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope. 
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid. 
So many books about war say the same thing, that nothing brings people together like war. 
And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms, rather than only a few, because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that. 
(Applause) Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this. 
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. 
It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people. 
Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy. 
My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. 
(Violin) That's a violin. 
A cold war is not as good as a cold peace, but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. 
So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun. 
Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother. 
This is a visual of education inside the prison. 
But the short story is: If you're a patient, you want to be on the blue line. 
Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. 
In the middle, we sort of made our way into a song called "Titi Boom." 
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. 
The first is collaboration. 
So that's the first big problem. 
(Applause) So let me ask for a show of hands. 
(Laughter) Same principle: it only has six moving parts, six motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect. 
Very small example of something that they could do. 
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is, I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish, because they manage their fisheries well, they're doing a good job. 
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions. 
So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. 
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries. 
We loosely call them "groups." 
There's a significant difference. 
This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form, in which I construct the narrative at stake. 
(Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. 
And he said, "I had a truck, before I went over there, and it had a stick. 
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern, and television, radio, magazines, books, gave us the one-to-many pattern, the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern. 
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. 
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them, to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. 
This was eliminated because the view was too good, and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open." 
Most scientists are really rather dull. 
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky. 
So, how could this happen? 
And I think, with all of the problems in science, one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid, finger around in the mechanics and peer in. 
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. 
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies. 
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up. 
I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days. 
And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978. 
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this. 
We have reached a kind of equipoise. 
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. 
They have trouble relating to other people. 
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store. 
As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places, in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa. 
(Laughter) My oh my, that makes it worse. 
Which size? 
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing, making the talks available online. 
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block, and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind, and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush. 
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build a shelter. 
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we look at an image we see, you know, color, depth, texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. 
We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. 
Let me give you a quick reminder of something that you've long forgotten. 
I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators. 
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense. 
Unlike the occupants of the universe, the universe itself is not wasteful. 
I would pass their sheet of paper. 
Not all civil society organizations are good. 
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. 
We need to take a really positive view. 
And most importantly, it's working. 
And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth. 
It was my mother with five little children. 
We've questioned the future of capitalism. 
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. 
Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there? 
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that, and there are many others. The web is one. 
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day, and see if they're doing better, they probably are. 
And given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next 15 years will come from emerging economies in the developing world, it could easily overtake the United States and become the largest economy in the world. 
Parents can learn a lot from that. 
BF: Yes. 
And now look at this second set of slides. 
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. 
And one thing kept bothering me, and that's, when they're functioning, penises don't wiggle. 
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. 
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today, they will be steering cars by wire, without all that mechanical stuff. 
Data is relationships. 
Only about one in every four million kids has this disease, and in a simple way, what happens is, because of a mutation in a particular gene, a protein is made that's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate. 
And so I did. 
There's a lot of work to be done after that. 
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle? 
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, "I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. 
(Applause) You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins. 
This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. 
I've never really gone out looking for work. 
So we opened the world’s first flight school. 
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. 
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ... 
And let's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression. 
Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter." 
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur. 
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. 
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch. 
This is a picture called a cutaway. 
And it really was a place where I learned to walk. 
And he watched the ball fly for a second, and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah. 
(Laughter) And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious, "Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does." 
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there, and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true. 
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform? 
It was extraordinary. 
So the way I tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space, a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow. 
He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world. 
And she said, "Well, he's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house, some rich American with your cameras around your neck, accusing me of enslaving my niece? 
(Music) ♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ 
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990. 
That's the consequence that we have to face. 
(Applause) I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. 
If we also have to wait for silence, they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate. 
What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon? 
And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. 
Anagnorisis and peripeteia. 
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled. 
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11, Derek was playing things like this. 
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. 
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. 
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden. 
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards, which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan. 
And then she looked back up and said, "I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head." 
And the difference then, they perceive as a loss. 
(Applause) I am the daughter of a forger, not just any forger ... 
And you see, you're very familiar with this. 
And shelter and place. You want to move [only] crosswind for 1.2 miles. 
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper. 
And most controversially, it means the tar sands. 
The day after our son was born, the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned. 
And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together, these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. 
And he became interested in that. 
And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s. 
Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, "life on an incline," that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. 
And what was amazing to me -- well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun -- but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it. 
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. 
CA: You're peeking. You just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back. 
And it's great, there's good people everywhere. 
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something. 
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently. 
Now we're thinking, what data can we release? 
So I took the husbands along. 
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center. 
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on. 
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland to get mica. 
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms. 
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. 
Now that is a particularly -- that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical. 
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us. 
The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life; that we can do good things, that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do, and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them. 
But what we saw -- this is an MRI image. 
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. 
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood, and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands, and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze. 
There will be many teams like our team that work on this. 
We express these things mathematically. 
People respond to that. 
And that's exactly what they do. 
When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system, it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact. 
And what that means is there's hope. 
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them. 
We have to make this available for people." 
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. 
I think that's a new species." 
We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. 
And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three. 
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light. 
They didn't know that what a seashell is, it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. 
Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most. 
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice, and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present. 
And media companies realize the audience is important also. 
There is no escape hatch. 
(Applause) Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife. 
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp. 
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does. 
Now, from the Shah's perspective, though, he wanted to keep this as secret as possible, so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance, traveled to Iran in the '70s, he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him. 
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back and say, well okay, but overall, what do we regret most in life? 
It elevates the temperature. 
But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters, their shapes and sizes. 
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. 
It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. 
The behavior problem was going away. 
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go. 
No more are we going to accept this." 
But we needed another test to make the diagnosis. 
We decided to give back locally. 
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. 
They engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age. 
And if you're navigating a dense information jungle, coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization, it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle. 
And I recoiled. They stank! 
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. 
And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream. 
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world." 
It is made for a diet which is soft, mushy, which is reduced in fibers, which is very easily chewable and digestible. 
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part, so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part, present that through a vaccine, what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies. 
And if I don't need it, I can convert it back up on the window to energy, light, and beam it, line of site, to your place. 
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership. 
This will take two years. 
It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds. 
And it's just a bit spooky. 
At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. 
Not excrement merely, not merely surface and orifice going unwashed, rediffusion of rum, there was will in it, and intention, power and purpose -- a social, ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too, though, grief, loss. 
They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration." 
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes. 
The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with, and those who see a future that starts to scare them, like the U.S. submarine community, which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. 
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. 
And it's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story, which is not what you originally intend. 
Well, I could also start here. 
(Applause) (Applause) Thank you. 
So that's how that works to me, the creative process, the process itself of street skating. 
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications. 
This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate. 
But about two centuries before David, the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron, and, slowly, that skill spread. 
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body. 
Gas, you can't see that. 
And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. 
They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things. 
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. 
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine. 
These one or two story structures, designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand, were not meant to be permanent buildings. 
But at 15,000 feet, it's tough. 
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar, with coffee, with beef. 
The dome was a request from the client. 
Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player. 
The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace. 
There are so many things you can do, but ultimately this is about something really simple. 
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium. 
What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow. 
They tried to solve the design problem. 
So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor. 
So I'm trying to penetrate that. 
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that? 
And certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country? 
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100. 
I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together. 
What animal species creates this civilization? 
And my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat, rice, potatoes, and the other crops, we may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves. 
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. 
And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai, has unbundled our projects into smaller, more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program. 
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. 
which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. 
I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old. 
And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. 
Back then, computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about, and no one dreamed of even having one at home. 
They were asking for democracy; they were asking for freedom. 
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. 
First you get one stone, then several more, and more and more and more and more, and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter) But they can damage your windshield, so you're not happy with that. 
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. 
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing. 
No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter. 
I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. 
And it really changed the dynamic. 
But as these get bigger in the future, what other items will you be able to print? 
(Laughter) But we have no idea why it does that. 
But the young people all came. 
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure. 
Because I have to say, for my whole career, if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it. 
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars, photographed by Emory Kristof. 
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. 
Can we play that one? 
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. 
This is the first time it has ever been recorded. 
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave, and when I discovered this, I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave. 
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. 
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see. 
And if you think this is absurd, it's not. 
We're just waiting for someone to lead us." 
Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation. 
So what I wanted to do next is, I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them, voices that could be customized for them. 
"Rosy" I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me. 
Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence. 
[Arabic] And this roughly translates: "Please, let me hold your hand. 
I've tried to encourage young girls. 
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. 
Woman: You don't need me. 
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it. 
I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. 
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition. 
And it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me. 
And she started, the Women's Health Initiative. 
It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations: Operation Hope, Project Smile. 
We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. 
1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time "noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah. 
What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter? 
This person starts apologizing for the fact that it's translated with a computer. 
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. 
The time had come for the men to make a plan, but they had very few options. 
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint, but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. 
I promise you, Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. 
If you look here at the dots, compare node B in the upper left to node D in the far right; B has four friends coming out from him and D has six friends coming out from him. 
I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. 
Three or four of us, in 1957, put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.

And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival. 
These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. 
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal. 
What happens when the music stops? 
We use nets that are 20 miles long.

That's the beauty of this economy. 
For the first time in years, Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura, and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion.

And finally the Chinese cracked down. 
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad, those square things? 
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though, we need to dissect network structure a little bit first -- and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person. 
(Laughter) So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one. 
I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. 
And the idea was to put McSweeney's -- McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year, and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time.

It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. 
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. 
It funds research all over the place.

You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist. 
Cooperative development is a way forward. 
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004, meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain, from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified. 
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo. 
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.

But, you know what? It's very, very regular. 
So I wanted to follow those. 
CA: The genes don't care but we do?

But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. 
A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. 
So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. 
(Laughter) But I was a little disappointed -- pretty young -- but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California, and I went to Berkeley. 
Now I had people in Washington last week told me, he said, "The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel.

And one question that you may then want to ask is, what happened when we met? 
Other views are also available. 
Now, in one sense, the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.

What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live? 
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.

Think about bittersweet chocolate; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits. 
And while, today, we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in 10,000 years, what I want to guarantee is that in 10,000 years, our descendants, our children's children, will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. 
It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space, of filling in the space. And then it started changing, and become folding on themselves.

The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. 
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women.

There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake, tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake, and, I'd argue, the security and future of you and your family is also at stake. 
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls, and that's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average, and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex. 
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?

I think, in fact, that if we realized how valuable social networks are, we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them, because I think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness. 
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them.

I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. 
Now fast forward to just three years ago. 
And rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language. 
So, in the end, I took a decision that, in retrospect, did change my life.

Last July, in Science, the journal Science, 19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article. 
I'll show you this again. 
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here. 
We tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships, but in many cases it only strengthens them. 
Now, this -- using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. 
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. 
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.

Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here. 
In the rest of my talk, I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script. 
Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly, dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have, is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design. 
She loved life. 
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed.

But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? 
Who should you invite to lunch? 
Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was because we were working with it. 
So why is it so important? 
We felt that they were out of date. 
One of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate. 
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region, has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.

And the only option, pretty much -- when it's stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair. 
So obviously there's a massive housing gap, and this really upset me, because academia tells you after a major disaster, there's typically about an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover, start the recovery process, but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes 45 to 60 days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.

Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation. 
I think it's a good thing, because utilities have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice. 
(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne (Singing) from Massachusetts. 
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair. 
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. 
Okay. That's the video. Thanks. 
It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost.

And as we think about that, we're actually beginning to find things like, do you have an ACE gene? 
It had nothing to do with their intellect, the quality of their intellect. 
It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say. 
If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff, and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.

Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another. 
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally, but I'm going to try. 
That good food's not for rich people -- good food's for everybody on the planet, and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it. 
Milo: I could just squish it. 
World peace. (Laughter) The telephone?

I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to, and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video) So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship? 
In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation. 
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence, but that are never sentimental, that never look away from the darkest things about us.

This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions. 
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature. 
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around, social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us, how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them, or because we're being paid to do them. 
And here is the limitation: adult stem cells are mature cells, and, like mature human beings, these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types, as embryonic stem cells [can]. 
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. 
Now they measured one other variable. 
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing. 
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me, so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think, Well, what else is there in life?

And this region, the regions within the limbic system, have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults, and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex, which you can see in blue in the slide here, which stops us taking excessive risks, is still very much in development in adolescents. 
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans, a heavily African-American space.

" So, that's what it does. 
I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan, who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct, and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church, one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed. 
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it.

I was taught that when I was eight years old. 
But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw, because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. 
Some of them show greater variability.

We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it. 
We're developing these tools, but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world, so people can study and try to treat different disorders.

This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there, and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. 
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. 
(Laughter) It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it. 
well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent. 
We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared. 
But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations, but also in the deeper senses of understandings, norms, culture, values and beliefs. 
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking. 
It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market. 
So, they're very important. 
It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. 
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book. 
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. 
"Uh-huh ..." she said. 
(Laughter) So that's one -- this boundary crossing, this go-between which -- Fritz Lanting, is that his name, actually said that he was a go-between. 
It makes things look effortless. 
Each of these is about a relationship, and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number, you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day. 
There are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation. 
But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. 
They've probably got these environmental risk factors and/or genetic risk factors we don't know about. 
So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union? 
The triage problem. That's a hard problem for reasons that I won't go through. 
It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart. 
[But most importantly,] [remember when you were a kid ...] [when everything was within you reach,] [and then say to yourself quietly, but with determination:] ["It still is."] Thank you very much for having me. 
So, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing, I go to close the window, and I hear people shouting outside, and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out." 
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure, but doesn't make us feel secure. 
And the model that we're working with in hospitals, and also with many, many different buildings, is to keep the outdoors out. 
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing? 
So thank you guys. 
So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers reported in the journal Nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer, and out of those 53 studies, they were only able to successfully replicate six. 
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal -- big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight, lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery. 
We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice. 
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah. 
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them. 
And you are correct. 
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule. 
So, who got more than five circles figured out? 
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening: wildlife disappearing, poaching was skyrocketing, and the situation seemed very hopeless. 
I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies. 
But then her sister started working the system. 
The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to. 
She wanted to change policy at the government level. 
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? 
And so it was nice when one of them would show up. 
(Applause) One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." 
Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there. 
I was 17 and going on a peace walk. 
But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail. 
(Applause) Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. 
Now we know for a fact it's happening. 
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week, and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response that I realized that design, that common design, that's in the public area means a lot to people, and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. 
He was right. 
He had made a very simple mistake. 
So a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern. 
They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. 
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. 
Without it we can't do anything. 
The music becomes a source for developing the dimensions of the human being, thus elevating the spirit and leading man to a full development of his personality. 
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation, but only if we put what we can into it. 
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day -- like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were. 
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time. 
When things were bad, we had porridge. 
And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. 
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light. 
How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. 
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent, after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said, "I've been here for one year, eight years, 12 years without a lawyer," he came and we had a training together and he said, "I have heard it said" -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources." 
It tastes ... 
A film tells a story. 
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. 
At every site there will be huge challenges. 
So let me give you a few striking examples of this. 
Goodnight sweet opossum." 
This is Aimee Mullins, who lost her lower limbs as a young child, and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident. 
Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire. 
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. 
(Laughter) When you leave the opera house, you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. 
If everybody on the planet lived the way we did, we'd need between five, six, seven, some people even say 10 planets to make it. 
Quoting from my writings: "My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together. 
We think it is shortcut. 
So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape -- the B -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules. 
And I have to tell you, it was energizing. 
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up. 
If you do 3:59:59, you're awesome, because you qualified for another race. 
I had a meeting with the president there, who told me about his exit strategy for his country. 
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today. 
Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution, a second kind of evolutionary logic. 
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are, but I think we can begin to think about them. 
We found another one last month. 
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years. 
But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. 
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts, if at all. 
Last year we had about two million people, which is about 10 times what we ever estimated. 
We can't travel everywhere. 
And this brings up mentors. 
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence. 
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord. 
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al. 
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings. 
Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens upon which the people depend. 
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that." 
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. 
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. 
And that's unlike many of our competitors. 
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively. 
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. 
To put it very simply, the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity, if you give them enough devices, democracy will inevitably follow. 
Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city, of legal buildings, with legal leases and legal rights. 
The kids got the pills, and then their performance improved. 
"Well this is very valuable. 
The moon. 
You're in a near vacuum in that environment, which is in minus 50 degrees. 
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon. 
And that's something that's easy to forget. 
But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store. 
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. 
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies. 
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit, on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons, cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse. 
The students went there in advance, and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches. 
Very simply won. 
People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote. 
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. 
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine." 
Why does this matter? 
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language. 
I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world. 
Because I have this problem ... " You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like, "If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late." 
And I see it over and over and over again. 
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. 
Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -- that was a genius link. 
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. 
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot. 
So armed with this information from the LHC, together with some colleagues here at CERN, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense Higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result. 
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference, and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. 
First of all, I must, as a speaker, provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you, instead of saying what I can't have. 
So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars, and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get. 
If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." 
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake. 
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes, but for example, one policy measure, feed-in tariffs on the energy system, which is already applied, from China doing it on offshore wind systems, all the way to the U.S. 
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts, and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper. 
The original meaning of the word "salvation" in the Bible is about saving the social system. 
One is the focused ultrasound, and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging. 
Commodity prices are like this. 
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us, and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. 
As a result, what happens? 
And we interact with the physical world with our hands. 
I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria — (Laughter) — be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler. 
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. 
It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. 
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. 
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components. 
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call "The Pygmies." 
It's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation. 
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. 
I’m trying to do everything very gently. 
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude. 
They came to Earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists. 
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners. 
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash. 
As I said, I respect other sports, and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events, but this is a sensory deprivation, a physical duress. 
People have murdered those that they loved, believing that they were murdering an imposter. 
So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. 
You have to become really interested in data, unsexy as that sounds. 
What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity. 
But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. 
So for a few days, that's how my living room was. 
She has twice the wingspan that I do. 
Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. 
Poetry does that. 
There is a single candle flickering in the center; by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions. 
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents. 
That's the thing. 
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. 
(Music) (Laughter) (Applause) Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute, hour by hour, with body, object, social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play. 
I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one. 
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. 
If they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data, 19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt, 16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you that the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. 
(Applause) We're going to begin in 1964. 
Here is in the field hospital. 
Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence. 
But kids don't mind. 
As my team leader Wynne once said, it's like doing a tattoo on someone. 
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him. 
1900s: maybe one percent. 
Also, they operate at high temperatures, and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down, but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances, or you lost off-site power in the case of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank. 
We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it. 
and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West, to get behind this wireless health institute. 
Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing, the brain fills in information that was not there, not originally stored, from inference, from speculation, from sources of information that came to you, as the observer, after the observation. 
I mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say, "Can I have a ride?" 
You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape. 
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one. 
In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth. 
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. 
So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis have had in recent time. 
Also for search and rescue applications as well. 
It triples the amount of oily, messy goo that you have in the water, and it makes it very hard to handle. 
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen, and we're pleasantly surprised when they do, we will be happy. 
And two boats: When the second boat was added, what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely. 
At that moment I was less and less human, I was also, at the same time, maybe the most human I've ever been. 
Really when we think of our senses, or when we think of the loss of the sense, we really think about something more like this: the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious, to smell something fragrant, to see something beautiful. 
What I'm involved with is the transition response. 
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. 
He wrote a long time ago, you know, thanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, mini-cams and more, the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. 
This is the flat floor configuration. 
That's why you have companies like Starbucks, right, that doesn't advertise at all. 
We used to raid villages, stealing chickens, goats and sheeps, anything we could eat. 
And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral. 
They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. 
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices, and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle: When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages; and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours. 
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV. 
Here is the video. 
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr. 
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition. 
You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder. 
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain." 
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine." 
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance. 
The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now. 
And at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin. 
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people. 
Now, take the Arab Spring. 
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age, but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident. 
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice. 
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. 
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness, California, because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now. 
And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma? 
These organisms we now bring into the lab, and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates, and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. 
Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. 
And yet, we began. 
They would get all dressed up and wait for him, but he would almost never come. 
It's just a euphemism for killing, right? 
The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success, generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them, and then spread them across the whole world, ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village, the skills, the practices, the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody. 
If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large, you had to live with a smaller gut. 
The first one was reaching the Pole itself. 
And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on, so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. 
But the statistical result is loud and clear. 
Get the facts. 
It's a definition really of Euclidean space. 
But many people today -- philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act, the last three decades of life. 
(Laughter) and ideas du bon marche. 
These are terrible and tragic figures. 
And everything, everything you say clicks with me, and it all makes sense. 
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. 
We get free content. 
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being. 
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. 
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor. 
Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along. 
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? 
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. 
The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers. 
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck, and if things go bad, child gets sick, parent dies, you always have somebody who has your back. 
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study. 
And you know what? You're wrong. 
I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. 
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off" meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation." 
They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto, they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential. 
It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular. 
Here is an example of our aerial camera. 
And when that happens, that will transform the way we have to understand our past, our present and human culture. 
Zhuomani instead of Armani. 
The debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled. 
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers. 
Now this is video of a session. 
Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
I've been doing this for 30 years. 
Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man. 
And you know what happened to Muti? 
Can we stop this, and how? 
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong. 
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. 
The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways; wired, wireless is growing exponentially. 
And it's the process of learning things. 
1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past. 
You see the middle class grow. 
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better." 
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here. 
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion. 
Now, what’s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide. 
And this network grew voluntarily, continues to be voluntary, and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative. 
And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. 
We can't stop our kids from using it. 
Here's the larger point. 
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. 
These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure -- that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work. 
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more. 
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace. 
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. 
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now. 
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not? 
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper. 
A study in Florida just a few years ago found that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility is just 50 percent. 
But this is an electrical restaurant. 
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results, thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it. 
Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana. 
And I noticed this in a very funny way. 
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals. 
So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up. 
They were doing something much simpler. 
The children looked and were amazed. 
Now, there's a funny thing going on here. 
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies. 
We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself." 
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught? 
And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. 
We learn those values on the Left, and maybe they'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the Right. 
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really, and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors. 
Within a decade or two, most American children will be born into homes with no father. 
If we cannot use smart biomaterials, then we'd rather use your very own cells. 
And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers, consumers into designers. 
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak. 
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset. 
The whole building is made of water. 
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed. 
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa. 
It's less naughty than it sounds. 
As I said, all the balconies can move, but they can also be disappeared completely. 
In the past, the universe was more dense, and it was also hotter. 
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. 
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America. 
And we said, "Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city. 
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods. 
He's the dude on the left. 
But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization, infects between 50 and 100 million people every year, so that's equivalent to the whole of the population of the U.K. being infected every year. 
We never published a paper together, but we did have a lot of fun. 
And there I got a gigantic one, and the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one. 
You understand that you can prepare, but the amount of preparation you can do is limited -- you can take some water, you can have a map, you can have a pack. 
We're right at that point of transition. 
Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works. 
Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres? 
We're all breathing air right now. Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, about 20 percent oxygen. About 80 percent nitrogen is in our lungs. 
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again. 
Do we have a solution? 
Where does it stop? 
There's a great opportunity today -- and that's what I really care about the most. 
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority, the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid-18th century. 
I say, "Time out. Stop." 
And to do that, we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system. 
After the Algerian war, at the heart of the international resistance movements, his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door. 
It lost 80 percent of its ice. 
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions, discharging in pathological concert. 
Life happened very quickly, and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. 
But that's not really the whole story. 
That would be the second best investment that we could do. 
We've been disconnected. 
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. 
People have to make a living. 
I found no flaw. 
So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. 
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences. 
The Tarahumara had a different strategy. 
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. 
When you write, because it's a conscious process, because you can look backwards, you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking. 
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there, because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix, and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. 
But it really hasn't been studied very much. 
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. 
Now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action. 
And it actually never sheds those leaves, so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. 
Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. 
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. 
So let's do a thought experiment. 
And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere, but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced. 
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist, we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions. 
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready. 
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals. 
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually. 
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. 
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different, vague possibility out there, but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. 
He's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature. 
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? 
This is interesting because this sleeping machinery, it's perfectly conserved. 
But that's what's lacking in a poor country. 
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. 
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter) I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration. 
I want to thank her too. 
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV. 
You've seen this in various forms, but maybe you haven't seen this one. 
So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood, of pests and pesticides. 
They take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka. 
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. 
It's a symphony of your universe, your reality. 
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer. 
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils. 
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. 
This is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s. 
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial. 
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera. 
We've discovered 6,000 drugs that I'm now licensed to prescribe. 
In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50. 
They get interested in something. 
Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. 
So they all trained. 
Now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made. 
And those are not 20 percent by 2020. 
I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. 
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea, and that's why I want you today to try to think about this, think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. 
And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. 
That's very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without platinum. 
The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. 
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. 
(Music: "Happy Together") So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT, Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. 
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions. 
The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport, and I could see again, vividly, the camera flashbulbs going off, the paparazzi, the autograph hunters, the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. 
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village. 
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up. 
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video, that they really were very well synchronized. 
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. 
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004. 
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers. 
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense. 
But, of course, I will have the winning hand. 
We would have no pains, but also no joys. 
So that's the third one, anger. 
"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers. 
It also brings up new issues, though, like computational irreducibility. 
You see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use, and on the right, it is two months. 
(Laughter) But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm. 
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands -- that pop out of the water. 
So we got a little snippet of a thought, and we could see it in front of us. 
No, we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground. 
And then I went ... 
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else. 
This issue isn't just theoretical. 
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit. 
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. 
This is just completely ridiculous." 
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality. 
And so if something isn't standard, "Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped." 
It's a new world. 
You can try it. 
three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile, and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance. 
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle. 
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations, but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization. 
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization. 
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them. 
It is a need. It is an urge. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
But what if we eat only in the green list? 
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk. 
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love, a psychological trap disguised as love, one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. 
I said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?" 
And love is not love, but being all shook up. 
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that. 
And I put strategy at the top of it. 
That really is an industrial revolution. 
I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. 
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. 
Because if we do, I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years. 
We may have some innovative, new ideas. 
(Laughter) In fact, it also shows something interesting, that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically, unfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior, which has also been increasing, has been increasing only arithmetically. 
What about the other aspects of living systems? 
For me, I really love this idea. 
(Music) And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it. 
I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. 
This river lends itself to India's name. 
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. 
Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive. 
What is this for? 
So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea, we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes. 
Spiders are also extremely old. 
I know this might be broadcast broadly. 
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control. 
Obviously, we hope that the strike is -- that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible. 
If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex, you discover that it's made up of little modules, G5 processors, like in a computer. 
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation. 
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different. 
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. 
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life. 
And in my hotel room, each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air, she would graze the wall and end up on the bed. 
And this didn't exist in Codices A and B. 
What is our approach? 
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one. 
Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self, appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next. 
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe? 
We have everything we need to start. 
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation. 
In fact, the older lady you just met: very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side. 
DP: He played "Chopsticks." AO: And played "Chopsticks." 
And even though the film didn't make any money -- barely broke even, I should say -- I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. 
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions, it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel. 
Again, going back to those high-speed videos, there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. 
And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk, the apocalypse would be unfolding -- (Laughter) -- I might have said, "Is it okay if I talk about something else?" 
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck. 
That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. 
And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. 
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages. 
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. 
But if you come about it from a different perspective, you can create some more interesting, more novel concepts. 
I mean, what are the numbers on this? 
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that, well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now, but they live in quite a different environment, and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. 
That's where the difference is. 
Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, at least they shot back. 
Martin Luther called the printing press "God's highest act of grace." 
I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT, but it was a very long-term view of how to develop technology, and it was going to be a very expensive technology, and also it would be patented. 
So the quantitative results were great. 
to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written 35 years ago. 
Architecture is the beginning of something, because it's -- if you're not involved in first principles, if you're not involved in the absolute, the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration. 
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you. 
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for. 
And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it's inherently viral. 
So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those. 
And there's really no evidence that says -- well, other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. 
Because he was a very popular Leftist leader, so the central government wanted to purge him, and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people, why he is so bad. 
So this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past, since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia. 
She could no longer breathe for herself. 
What can we do together that benefits us both? 
And when it dies, it falls to the bottom and then it rots, which means that bacteria break it down. 
And the only way you can solve these problems -- and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century -- is through cooperation, through working together, which means that soft power becomes more important, that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. 
Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living, this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10." 
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling. 
And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times, you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully, those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times, you'll see each hair has split ends. 
And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. 
And the loser is unreconciled. 
This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts. 
So she was making a politically rational decision. 
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact, it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults, you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were. 
That's the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy. 
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin." 
Now, when I was first doing this, all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources. 
It was in a grizzly bear preserve, although no one told me that before we went. 
I'll just go one step further. 
This isn't only about religion. 
Thank you. 
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. 
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse. 
And that's the thing that bothers most people, is that progress is really real, but we wonder and question: What are the environmental costs of it? 
It's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. 
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands. 
This is a high-altitude helium balloon. 
We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. 
And it just disturbed me so much. 
And this is what it looks like with visible light. 
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it. 
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining, without crying, while they sang things like: "Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water," and "I done done," "This little light of mine." 
I'll give you one of them. 
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day. 
It can grow; you can grow it; and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty. 
Well, that first cutaway picture worked, so we said, "Okay, let's do some more." 
(Laughter) Now why am I telling you this story, and what does this have to do with the future of health? 
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial. 
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came. 
The approach worked. 
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size. 
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. 
I slam the door behind me, climb up, go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking. 
But this chickenwire carbon, called a carbon nanotube, is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs. 
You're clear. All right. Firing. 
And he takes me into this room, and he closes the door, and he says, "I have 75 children here in the orphanage, and it's total bedlam." 
So, you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual, social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. 
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person." 
So let me reassure you about something. 
She jumped out of that car." 
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth: very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences. 
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it. 
Right. Dumbest idea ever. 
And yet, on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947, Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility, and in so doing, he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound. 
So here's the good news. 
But I think there's something else going on. 
This is the natural history of heart disease, but it’s really not natural because we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people had once thought. 
We have thousands of organisms that can do this. 
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't. 
Audience: Fold. 
Thank you. (Applause) Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. 
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. 
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared. 
One says, "Weapon of mass protection." 
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. 
(Video) English Mother: Ah, I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice. 
Right, I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison. 
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. 
What’s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind, is that then it tells you that the nose, the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. 
That's human heart. 
We are not talking about 50,000 dollars here, or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there. 
When you think about that, let me go back to what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity, "Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon, if you will. 
Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. 
And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed. 
So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly, is one of, truly, the founders of the environmental movement, a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog, someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand. 
It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses. 
And people with silent ischemia -- which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms -- it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital. 
So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space, into city life. 
"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?" 
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be. 
The aircraft, while in flight, will communicate with technicians on the ground. 
They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) — personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters. 
And we should know, I think, we should know where our Internet comes from, and we should know what it is that physically, physically connects us all. 
To you and me, that's a heart attack. 
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system, making it one genetically identical individual. 
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are." 
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments. 
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones, using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. 
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here. 
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube. 
So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. 
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. 
And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful." 
We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants. 
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. 
Are they interconnected? 
But there will always be another war." 
But it's not bacterial pneumonia. 
Does it predict human-level intelligence? 
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. 
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher, who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. 
And I had a major breakthrough when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura. 
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter) And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe that people can see into the future. 
So there it is; the retinas are baking. 
Here's a big website where we've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things. 
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs. 
I did quite a lot of research. 
And I thought, "I should patent this." 
So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day. 
And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year. 
I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. 
Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. 
That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. 
(Laughter) But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close. 
And so every thing will be part of the Web. 
(Laughter) Thank you very much. 
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees. 
I think they just have one idea in their mind, which is, where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. 
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number -- this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. 
And that is exactly what we found. 
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information. 
And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved, and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful, sterile facilities like this. 
Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. 
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old. 
They each do their own thing, flashing on and off, paying no attention to their neighbors. 
It's about the well-being of nations. 
We can't cure it all. 
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. 
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence; it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform. 
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change. 
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is. 
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking. 
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment, and made available on web, call-center and franchise physical offices, for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. 
So as we think about power in this century, we want to get away from this view that it's all I win, you lose. 
The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace-keeping skills. 
So how do we deal with this? 
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice, they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter) Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons. 
They are bird-blending machines. 
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming. 
And most granularly, I break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world -- so an extreme level of granularity. 
And so instead, they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way, but above all, two sectors, and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime. 
If the group doesn't take action, the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. 
It's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale. 
Okay, Ines. 
Popcorn changes all of that. 
The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census is the role of global science. 
And she didn't see him for years. 
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state, when you're totally immersed in something you are doing. 
Now let me take you -- I've been a realist -- I went from theorist early to realist. 
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch, but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. 
And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied -- but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. 
Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident. 
There are many. 
So this is all very prototypey at this point. 
(Laughter) Every time I look at this piece, I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad, "He finally folded his laundry." 
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country. 
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one. 
This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges river dolphin, various species of turtles, thousands of migratory birds, and fishing is causing problems like this. 
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but this has got something else in it. 
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this? 
He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college, where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car that accommodated his unusual body. 
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu, but they switched to Tamiflu. 
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. 
If my room back home had looked like this, my mother would have grounded me for three days. 
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. 
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously? 
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. 
All of that occurs within working memory. 
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. 
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order." 
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button. 
The phone, in contrast, the most lies. 
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. 
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer. 
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry. 
So this is a woman, 46 years old, who had recurrent lung cancer. 
This next one here, I did a story on the census of marine life. 
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years? 
You can lean back, but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. 
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." 
This is from the coast of Brittany, which is being enveloped in this green, algal slime. 
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts. 
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young. 
And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower. 
Urbanization, integration, coming together, leads to a new renaissance. 
Take a look at what that is! 
Here's my brain. 
and undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter) Now this was a really exciting experience for me. 
For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really, of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. 
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death. It's strange -- extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. 
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by 1900. 
I've been doing this for the last 15 years; it's my side job, if you want. 
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me, like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning. 
But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. 
I never really knew whether it worked. 
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!" 
I had a sleeping bag. 
The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example, is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. 
But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. 
You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests, you try to anticipate it, but after anticipating it, you constantly asses it, not just once, but eternally. 
And I'd say, "I don't believe that." 
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. 
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work. 
I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different." 
I asked him, "Why?" 
And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns, it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems, like hospital-acquired infections. 
We're using light as a building material in this case. 
It's called "The Country." 
So we decided to paste white, white on the walls. 
Well, at least, we did once. 
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million. 
If at all possible, we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. 
If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number, and that's why chessboards, eight by eight, have 64 squares. 
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple. 
Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets. 
It's all in English, and I'm going. 
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis. 
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then. 
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko. 
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces, because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce, but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle. 
That's really not affordable. 
You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects, but new technology is changing the way we can film. 
And he showed up and said, "Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man, and I want to help you." 
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. 
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing. 
So I should talk about art. 
Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior, in terms of doing analytic thinking, remembering billions of facts accurately. 
The question is: why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later? 
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation. 
(Applause) My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now. 
It's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient. 
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. 
It was a very aesthetic ideology. 
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?" 
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. 
How enduring, our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. 
So this is a lighthouse. 
We had to go back the following year, all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska. 
So here's a tale of passion. 
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was, but it's serving its community. 
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle. 
No, there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years. 
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. 
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them. 
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan. 
In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. 
The second challenge was cells. 
The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people. 
It's deeply embedded in the brain. 
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids. 
So were the followers of Hippocrates. 
It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front. 
That's the story of civilization. 
It shouldn't be that difficult. 
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn. 
This bit, the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management. 
But it has its limitations. 
At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we'd follow up. 
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business, has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace. 
Now, from an environmental standpoint, the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal, the two major sources of electricity. 
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant. 
And we're getting to that. 
My parents met in Oxford in the '50s, and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. 
So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life. 
But the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant, and almost an international model. 
Have I not myself been imprisoned? 
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book, "Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book, nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don't belong in schools. 
So it's not the final story, but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level. 
And they go "Meow! Ow!" 
But unfortunately, as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do, but I can see where we will -- but even as we're in the process of doing that, another huge problem is looming, and people aren't noticing. 
KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something? 
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. 
Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience. 
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch. 
They have very different densities. 
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms; they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms, or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms. 
which means there would be very little resolution, what we call boundary or edge detection, and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light, the depth of field, the distance at which you can focus and see details, would have been less than 18 inches away. 
And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. 
I've learned that there's no boundaries, and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense. 
So we're creating our own archives and so on. 
An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live. 
(Laughter) René Descartes, of course. Once again these Grenada people, this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination. 
And you know what I've learned? 
I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets." 
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. 
RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying, you know, come on, Richard, there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic. 
Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. 
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. 
This is an ecological network. 
And in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design. 
And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving, and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. 
He robbed him at gunpoint. 
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes. 
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy, and we sang, with a childlike heart, "a soldier in each son." 
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization. 
And this chart goes back to 1500. 
You can see every step I take. 
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be -- (Laughter) (Applause) CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen? 
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat, now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat. 
And so, every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job. 
And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. 
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. 
"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio." 
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. 
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars, and that translates to "aru meen," which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. 
Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling. 
(Dolphin noises) You see, they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad. 
He has no bookings left. 
It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men. 
So, when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not outdated. 
And the concept is to create a kind of onion, a kind of structure in layers. 
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002, Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest. 
You take off and land at a local airport. 
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet. 
The next issue that resolved was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain is caused by imbalance, the other 10 percent, largely -- if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer and hormonal issues -- is the circulation. 
They all have a lot in common with brain science. 
And this is Felix, actually. 
But instead, I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore. 
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago. 
We were still back where Copernicus was. 
This is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers, and the devices that our brains use to compute. 
This site will document every story, every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website, you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started. 
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly. 
Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri. 
And they're geographically more limited than you are, because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home, or occupationally or as a child. 
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning, and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool. 
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. 
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts. 
We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines. 
But play's a shapeshifter. 
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, "We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. 
There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled, simulated and tested: the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex; cerebellum, where we do our skill formation; slices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking. 
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29], where God talks about legumes and seeds, and on one more stanza about green plants, ostensibly missing is meat. 
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did. 
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter) And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers. 
And what we’re going to do is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class. 
It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. 
People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. 
Three hours of bottom time, average distance traveled -- one mile. 
Our credibility? 
But he didn't have Wikipedia. 
Why phosphorus in particular? 
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. 
But we were still missing a critical element. 
So we call it a relational universe. 
We want to express, to reveal ourselves, but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form. 
Geron, just last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. 
They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology, which is a prior discipline to the study of economics. 
I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology. 
I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day. 
(Laughter) The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. 
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. 
It's absolutely pitch black, because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean, which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet. 
And this was very consistent. 
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. 
He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now. 
And so, coming directly from there to here. 
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket. 
Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy. 
PM: So how large is the collection? 
The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them, because you want to be connected. 
Gradually, bringing it down, bringing it down. 
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me, "Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?" 
Excuse me. You're missing the point. 
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works. 
Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally -- again, once more, after 20 shock treatments -- I would say, "Ah, fuck it." 
"Special: big tits," Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand. 
(Applause) SM: Going back to straddling between East and West, last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival here in Doha. 
And fat has nine calories per gram, whereas protein and carbs only have four. 
And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches. 
And so what you're seeing here -- and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. 
What could be our real needs? 
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you. 
She can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game. 
So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm. 
But more importantly, I think, is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under 30, and there are many, of course, who are well over 30. 
MRI generates over a thousand. 
I can move around here. I can extend. 
And as you all know, anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans. 
For example, while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists, it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science. 
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries. 
Life hardened and became defensive. 
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. 
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on. 
It's all very one-dimensional. 
10 years later, the Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands. 
Well, 58 percent said yes, which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say, "Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!" 
And I don't want it to leave me behind. 
Over the 15 years before the financial crisis, the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before. 
So these are tuned toes -- there are six of them, and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint. 
And days later, 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping. 
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should. 
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. 
CA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce. 
It's the same problems in the Galapagos, except, obviously, it's worse here, in some ways, than other places. 
It's a little poem called "Budapest," and in it I reveal, or pretend to reveal, the secrets of the creative process. 
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago, nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them, till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands? 
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. 
(Applause) My name is Kate Hartman. 
I mean, I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it. 
But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet, embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine, we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls? 
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer than the average Chinese. 
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. 
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project. 
And it's a brand new leadership challenge. 
How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work, kind of like the Mozart metaphor, where, "Oh, MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. 
So, I started to write computer programs that study very, very large sets of these online footprints. 
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman. 
Of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other into different, very normative ideas. 
I know I should mention: I'm making all these things. 
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly. 
After many people said I couldn't do that. 
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean. (Laughter) MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. 
So I worked with white noise. 
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases, people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case. 
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides. 
But this trend is less unambiguous. 
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. 
Today, the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. 
(Laughter) So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this -- that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set. 
No one's listening. No one's trusting. 
This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure. 
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses. 
Somebody is camping in your head. 
I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19th century -- actually, in the second decade of the 19th century -- by a 27-year-old poet whose name was Percy Shelley. 
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001. 
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China. 
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online? 
Simply, if you are talented, if you have the vocation and the will to be here, you get in. You share with us and make music. 
So the management of Electrolux took our pile, our list of incentives, and they went outside the room for 17 minutes, and they came back in and they said, "Wow, this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here. 
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself, to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war. 
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too. 
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day. 
In East Asia, we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
Look carefully: this is slowed down 100 times, and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg. 
The biggest asset, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man: This is Dr. Chip Zullinger, fondly known as Dr. Z. 
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free. 
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. 
Those are the effects that we're going to see. 
I'm going to start off by playing a video for you. 
There's certainly no quick security fix. 
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. 
No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? 
It's now been FDA approved, and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. 
No, we're having a little fun. 
What about quarantine? 
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students, the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people, as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. 
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing. 
So I told her. 
So, I run over to Gene, and I wake him up, and I say, "Gene, don't freak out, I think the hotel's on fire." 
And the seat riser, for example, serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. 
We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans, including the older trials, because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008, and I don't know what world it is in which we're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years. 
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously. 
Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis? 
Now, she had no idea what to look for. 
That's a big skull. 
But Wagner made an innovation. 
That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland. 
Why am I trying to sell you a half-built bridge? 
What does that mean? 
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation. 
Finally in 1954, someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé. 
So the city planners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. 
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving, the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg, but without the brain. 
(Music) In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. 
I walked up to Ashland, Oregon, where they were offering an environmental studies degree. 
But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that -- you know, we try many, many different things in our company. 
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. 
After all, in a totally free labor market, we could find jobs for pretty much everyone. 
And what went through my mind was, how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables? (Laughter) It doesn't happen in most classrooms, but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables, they don't know why they're learning it. 
It's very good. Don't let that stop you. 
And it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed, and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?" 
To date, with the help of a global network of partners, we've completed close to fifty projects. 
And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds, a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models, like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models. 
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part? 
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved, because they have very strict kind of design guideline, and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them. 
Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist. 
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe, and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket. 
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. 
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut. 
And then, navy pilot training, and, after college, I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying, and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun, but got tangled up with some great professor types, who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science. 
And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways. 
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual. 
Just read where those guys are from. 
(Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right. 
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off? 
Change has accelerated as human populations rose. 
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way. 
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus. 
And I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on. 
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism. 
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams, a local dentist happened by. 
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you? 
Hundreds? One, three. 
Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between reality and video games. 
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again? 
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. 
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child, but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment. 
You just click it, and they're there. 
Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. 
Imagine you can do that. 
Very, very simple. 
And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy. 
It's good for everybody. 
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. 
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post-docs who have taught me so much, and I have had many of these groups come and go. 
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me. 
We've had economic analysis pointing out that, not only can we afford it, it's cheaper to act early. 
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away. 
We can make progress. We can show benefits. 
(Laughter) And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. 
The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition, it was really about showing people, in this city, as they walk by, that space has dimensions. A space has time. 
I think nature gave them a helping hand here. 
Thank you very much. 
His name is Jesse Sullivan. 
My hair used to be straight. 
And so therefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return. 
And that was the onset of ALS. 
All I am is a witness. 
Now I don't know where you guys were, but I was in my living room. It was practically a religious event. 
And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. 
And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned, depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years. 
You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now. 
They talk about it. They've sanitized it. 
Thank you. 
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region. 
I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
She was in a great evening gown. 
They're all different. 
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti. 
You've heard that saying. 
(Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. 
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and offline. 
The peace talks dragged on and on and on. 
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. 
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this, and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this, and by and large the results have all been the same, that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well. 
It is generic. 
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. 
But who is it going to feed? 
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns. 
We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game. 
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola. 
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers. 
So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. 
My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother, who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing. 
So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone, without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear, as far as the type of life on Earth is. 
And after five minutes, this is what you see: just a typical dead corpse, shriveled, sucked-out, dead corpse of the spider mite, and next to it, two satiated individuals of predatory mites, a mother on the left-hand side, a young nymph on the right-hand side. 
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. 
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. 
If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way, and I just jump right in ... 
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike, and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation, so in the respect that children, if they would like to read, you just take this incentive away in just paying them, so it just changes behavior. 
We're still working on it and we're developing the wingsuits to get better performance, to get more knowledge. 
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids. 
Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. 
"Come on, man! What policemen? 
And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience. 
It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment, from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency, or even just interestingness. 
And we placed electrodes in area 25, and in the top scan you see before the operation, area 25, the sadness area is red hot, and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue, and then, after three months of continuous stimulation, 24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation, we have a complete reversal of this. 
And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are -- this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web -- but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff -- we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. 
Education is so essential. 
What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then. 
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do, first. 
That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is. 
(Laughter) This formula works wherever metaphor is present. 
This is my message to you. 
We knew it wasn't lung cancer. 
And these prices are actually with clean electrons. 
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. 
That's what we're probably genetically specified for. 
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere. 
Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then, back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese. 
And so, step number three on this journey: We know, if we're going to keep making this progress, we're going to have to turn up the volume, we're going to have to increase the visibility, and we're going to have to engage the public. 
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. 
People come around us and start asking, "What are you doing here?" 
Say, "Please repeat that process." 
In other countries there is protection for our artful designs." 
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland, and we have repeat photography positions, that is places we just visit on an annual basis, in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia. 
The hare itself, the animal -- not a cat, not a dog, a hare -- why a hare? 
But if you can model things for people, if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes, then they can learn a lesson, they can see, they can move on, they can understand. 
Can you tell us how it worked? 
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over, and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool, you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer, and find everything you've lost, and I loved it. 
And I see the power of music. 
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!" 
What else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills? 
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet. 
And we should remember who employed the sharecroppers: the Democrats, right? 
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play. 
So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future, but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection. 
It gets worse. 
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time? 
I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting, gastronomy, good food. 
But the reason that I mention it is that early on, Rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight: "Every act of communication is an act of translation." 
It's not an unreasonable thing to do. It's an economically efficient thing to do. 
You understood exactly what I just said in English. 
There was the florist, and I can understand that, once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally, but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you. 
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame. 
I ended up at this really fancy party. 
This is ice water on Mars. 
It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. 
Now, why is that a good thing to do? 
Again, imagine those all back and forth there. 
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut, who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15, and he was there to basically double check my science. 
It's a new university that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience, and myself. 
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern -- well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory. 
(Laughter) But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. 
Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. 
That was Bob's last record, yeah. 
But it's all good in the grand scheme of things. 
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. 
So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression. 
So we started doing some repairs. 
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up. 
They wouldn't have me. 
Well, leadership. 
It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions. 
And a third returned to historic Palestine, did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money. 
If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth. 
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun -- in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it. 
(Laughter) "He models genes." 
We're moving up one of these pillars. 
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. 
So how do I start all this? 
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge, and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue. 
(Applause) I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you. 
So we dashed, all of us, towards the shelter. 
And it gets quiet. 
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero. 
It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. 
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims. 
She has to know something about what stories are available. 
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built. 
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy, or empathy, at any rate, is what's critical to this kind of interview. 
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas, all the fossil fuels, have changed the atmosphere greatly. 
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication, effacement, the perfume of our consternation. 
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures. 
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?" 
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts. 
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology? 
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. 
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is, deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old -- these guys aren't running marathons; they're running mega-marathons. 
(Whistling) Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. 
And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact, there's an econometric study, the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that. 
We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by. 
So Jordan's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself. 
And we don't have any industry at all -- it's only because of this deforestation. 
Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place. 
And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. 
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. 
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah? 
And I know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs. 
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own, even if they know everything about the disease, they still may not change their behavior. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you. 
They were imaginative. They buried their dead. 
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. 
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. 
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare -- where the Red Sox won the World Series. 
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here; if I'm not going to beat these girls, I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know? 
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life. 
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private? 
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep and goats, overgrazing the plants, leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. 
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim. 
Which of these hypotheses can be true? 
I call this Thunderwear. 
She was very tall, I would say. 
As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church, who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that. 
Girl 2: That would be so stressful. 
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum, let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned. 
And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth-like planet. 
but if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this. 
E: Happy birthday to you. 
If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni, we would hit them very hard, and it would be very, very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. 
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective. 
And these forces act on, attract, bodies that have an electrical charge. 
So what can we learn from all of this? 
Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it? 
She said, "Yes, sir." 
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. 
I wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC." 
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen?" 
Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies. 
My background is not exactly conventional medical training. 
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world. 
You can see on the microscope slide here, that's what's happening in real time. 
Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo, there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild. 
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. 
And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut. 
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs, current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues, and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts. 
And for me, that's a win-win. 
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. 
The point is, when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain, it may also be the right kind of reasoning. 
But let me show you how to work this device. 
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress." 
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth. 
But the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works. 
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. 
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some, because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns. 
Watch how often the beetle dances. 
A lot of you said, "Ten." 
Just spread it as wide as possible. 
This has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol. 
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place, and a right half that binds it in a different place, and brings the long strand together like this. 
I want you to demand it. 
This is a tense moment in the first football game, I think. 
(Laughter) No. 
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. 
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia. 
The second is for continued population, human population expansion. 
It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing. 
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere, from fossil fuels, from cement production. 
But then we looked at recent urban development, and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street, 30 years ago. All bikes, no cars. 
This is, you know, the movie poster. 
But you know what? 
We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain. 
It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology. 
So, what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane. 
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it, and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years. 
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been, OK. This was not a prevalent view, few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic. 
I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk." 
They want to take them out of the domain name system. 
There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say, "What are those twinkling lights?" 
And if we rely, as we do at the moment, solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences, we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame. 
If I throw a very concentric circle, or concentric ellipse, it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines, which get closer and closer together, which describes how gravity works. 
I was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. 
We've now done that procedure, and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases, so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus. 
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish. 
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. 
Look at this. 
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months, and when I finally turned it on, I actually hated it. 
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign, He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind. 
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting. 
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience. 
That's exactly what we must do. 
And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. 
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant. 
Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules, in many of our molecules of life. 
We can't even afford to eat anything except beans. 
Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. 
The American will say, "I am because I am, and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime." 
In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment. 
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. 
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club. 
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire. 
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States. 
We've got mouth cancer to solve. 
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is, "What made you interested in this subject?" 
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels. 
Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities. 
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road, feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts, feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. 
This little squid is called the fire shooter Now it may look like a tasty morsel, or a pig's head with wings -- (Laughter) but if it's attacked, it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes. 
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask: Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines? 
All right, well, what about online dating? 
They are free from all of these modern ailments. 
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks, and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense. 
It was that enveloping, and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, and it was my instep, and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb. 
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds. 
Thank you steel mill. 
And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. 
In the first place, people started to send me all kinds of duck-related things, and I got a real nice collection. 
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting. 
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey, stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,' and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat. 
So I will do this. 
We have to get climate-ready crops in the field, and we have to do that rather quickly. 
In particular, it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. 
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. 
And they are building what I call the Spinternet. 
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail. 
And we all had all of that on tapes. 
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens: there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen. 
It's going to be built by users, by people who get this data together, by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from, all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from, people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things. 
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great." 
It's not sustainable. 
Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone, they are bigger than the phone itself. 
So what happens? 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith. 
So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. 
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories. 
And now, here comes the other pirate. 
Once we see that markets and commerce, when extended beyond the material domain, can change the character of the goods themselves, can change the meaning of the social practices, as in the example of teaching and learning, we have to ask where markets belong and where they don't, where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about. 
And that's exactly where we are. 
And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure -- neither of which offense he actually committed. 
This must be who I'm directly descended from." 
(Laughter) I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them. 
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall, you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall, and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal -- that's when computers have reached human intelligence. 
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan. 
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. 
I mean, what are we fighting over right now? 
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. 
We see all the same symptoms. 
And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. 
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here. 
And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. 
CA: My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design, technology and business, so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business, into one package, synthesize it in a way that very few people can and -- and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks. 
And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves, and you get a big mess, a big mess that you can't possibly clean, you can't touch, you can't extract and, I think most importantly -- this is what I think -- you can't see it. 
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch. 
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress, walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited." 
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks? 
And recently, they've written us letters, telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams, on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal. 
And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this, until this year, I learned something that I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news, and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think people won't believe me. 
Of course all happy families aren't alike." 
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. 
Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people, and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.

But she wasn't alone that day, because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea, and they do every day. 
Four, modern medicine. 
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect, but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women, because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. 
Go home to where? 
About a year after 9/11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. 
(Laughter) "'I give life and I take it away. 
How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from, for example, a submissive spouse, an in-law, a servant, a slave, an employee? 
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring, along a roadside. 
So this is an example. 
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used. 
KS: Thank you. 
And so the show was given the green light. 
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. 
But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute. 
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here. 
And our minds have altered, too. 
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space. 
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. 
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. 
This is Mengatoue. 
And you can look at more pictures. 
I want to suggest that actually, globaloney can be very harmful to your health. 
And I remember at the beginning of my career, again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras, I would be going completely insane on the podium, trying to engender a small scale crescendo really, just a little upsurge in volume. 
Well, it was the whole city. 
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs: actually losing it, never to be seen again. 
Here you see the data. 
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is. 
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. 
Are we just being numbingly stupid? 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one. 
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud, etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud. 
So we went a little wider. 
And why is this important? Well, this is the most expensive bed. 
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are. 
"But what if I saw them? You know, couldn't we stay together?" "No." 
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker. 
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know, up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa," but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here, it comes from the North Sea. 
Acts of God." In this picture, five acts of God are as important as everything else. 
So my final statement is: love is in us. 
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he's now an instructor. 
You know, by the way, there are two million people in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums. 
We have to come and attack this problem with a focus, with an effort that actually says, we're going to go to zero before the world ends. 
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. 
All of this stuff starts moving into industry. 
Pretty much for the vast majority of history, no one gave a damn about 1950. 
There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe.

But they're both different. 
And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? 
So he saw a need and he stepped in. 
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels. 
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy. 
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. 
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware, more noble and more just society. 
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools. 
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world, somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. 
This is lunacy. We all know the Earth isn't moving. 
But that lag is exactly what is expected. 
6:20. 
But instead of saying, we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded, Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos. 
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea." 
And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types. 
And they didn't know how far they would really have to go, and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. 
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing, but reintegration in the environment is important. 
China is not like the West, and it will not become like the West. 
But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame, a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking? 
It's a strange exuberance about materials, about the world: a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now. 
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. 
And so I went to each of those countries at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times. 
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago, this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people. 
But compared to that, losing two? 
And when it comes to planets and their distances, this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. 
By doing that, you are now part of my piece. 
Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. 
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front. 
Life adds information to matter. 
♫ Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac. ♫ ♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫ ♫ They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham, ♫ ♫ that's why these feminists just need to find a man. ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫ I’m Dennis Kucinich and I approved this message. 
It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. 
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. 
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated. 
When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. 
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. 
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. 
Gamma is just one of these companies. 
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago. 
That's the Pacific Gyre. 
I had written these crazy things. 
Also, the people had changed. 
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. 
Consequently, we have. 
I'm very lucky, because he's better than all the other children. 
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk. 
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course. 
And he was Swiss. 
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there, pushing him in, those turned up jeans.

Here's what we do. 
So the teacher rings up the parents, and says, "Very shocking story from little Billy today. 
And as you see, in the middle, there is our old friend, the hacker. 
They talk about these kinds of experiences. 
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time, like cancer, we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level. 
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce. 
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together. 
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. 
Actually as was pointed out earlier, we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there. 
I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe." 
And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it. 
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. 
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected. 
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. 
The metalworkers, for the most part, do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff. 
It's meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations. 
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work. 
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it. 
But it's not. 
And there isn't always a translator available. 
The other thing you can take from this, by the way, is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. 
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention, meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge, they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. 
I heard you were looking for me." 
Polar bears are amazing hunters. 
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators. 
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids, kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life. 
We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. 
And here's a brief clip of this. 
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. 
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. 
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species." 
No. There will still be paper dictionaries. 
How have we not made the connection? 
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000. 
He has a character describing the snowflake, and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death." 
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay, eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus, Traditional Japanese." And so on. 
10 hours a day at this speed. 
But what were they there for? To acquire assets. 
I mean, the power of the city -- we talked about cities as being centralized in space, but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. 
Now even after all of this granular level of control, do futureless language speakers seem to save more? 
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education, her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams. 
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. 
So it’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we’re in, and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere, that makes science work. 
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products. 
Just like we all have eyes, but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes. 
It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother. 
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. 
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group. 
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. 
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph, the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be. 
Absolutely vital. 
Gone." 
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts. 
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him? 
Help me. 
Let's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts. 
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms, and you want to take them to India." 
But my work wasn't just about the research. 
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. 
In order to sustain our work into the future, we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them, whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites, and at the same time, it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future. 
Books have saved the introverted, timid child that I was -- that I once was. 
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic, and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it. 
But, most importantly, while I was traveling, I taught children cartooning, and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous. 
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody. 
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago. 
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through. 
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless. 
I was, like, aha, wait a second. 
And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses, a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we're used to, at least on the viral level. 
"Go for it, brother." 
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been -- because it was Kanji, Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language. 
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. 
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. 
They smell with their antennae. 
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside. 
(Laughter) Well, yeah, a lot of them. 
And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge of the last mile. 
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that. 
It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes, which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space. 
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare, that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater, even during those dark days of the war. 
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.

But of course, we can do better. 
I also put in here the stress response. 
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one. 
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important, because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it, but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it. 
So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. 
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books -- "Spiderman" and "X-Men." 
What was my calling? What should I do? 
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies. 
I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street. 
And it's going to be used for diet as well, and nutritional supplements and such. 
So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet? 
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do. 
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies, proximity to death, or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death, I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. 
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard. 
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads. 
And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it. 
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. 
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented. 
And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. 
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach." 
This is not big news to viticulturists; they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization. 
And then we went down one more step. 
But this is different if we now look at the European individual and an African. 
And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's way more interesting. 
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model: special people, special places; patent it, push it down the pipeline to largely waiting, passive consumers. 
So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket. 
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive.

I want to prevent this shit from happening. 
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map. 
I was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw, the headaches pretty much resolved, but that then my teeth weren't in the right place. 
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one. 
There's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. 
As you can see, he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art, and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work. 
It's going to stick out its hands. 
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally, and it surely doesn't work virtually. 
So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this, to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. 
I work with some of the most amazing people. 
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. 
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick, just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. 
That's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world. 
And so, what they would do is, they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages, and they would introduce all this sound and motion. 
And why was I fascinated? 
It's completely irrelevant. 
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. 
It became a killer app of links, and today, of course, we call that the World Wide Web. 
It has administrators in it and many, many other things. 
Everything makes us so privileged, that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day. 
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced. 
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it." 
We're living through one of those moments. 
And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative, through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up-to-date conservation practices. 
Boy: Spiny. 
That's a geranium pollen. 
Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave. 
It used to be end-to-end encrypted. 
And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left. 
But my subject is national security. 
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth. 
That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous. 
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. 
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. 
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that. 
You plan on coming back, getting undressed, going to bed, waking up, doing it again, and that anticipation, that rhythm, helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives, and gives it a measure of predictability. 
(Laughter) The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good? 
I'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer. 
There is more of it than you think, actually.

How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work? 
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. 
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape, and the more we are moving forward, and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter) But I wanted to show you a fish because -- In fact, it's very different from a fish. 
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin, and you smooth it out, so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is. 
For example, it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant, like Celine, sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read, let alone understand.

There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight. 
At the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom, all the sensors, all the microprocessors, all the stuff inside. 
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding, getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities. 
Is it really just us? 
(Laughter) The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors, and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints. 
(Music) Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365. 
Thank you very much. 
Why? Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists. 
And so every drop was a little bit different. 
So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent, but actually it's mobile-only, so while everybody else is doing all of those things, we're solving the world's problems. 
He realized at once what had happened. 
If the rules for the universe are simple, it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level; operating, for example, far below the level of space or time, which makes it hard to represent things. 
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers, more biomass of herbivores, too, like these parrot fish that are like marine goats. 
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that. 
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. 
And the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature. 
Yes, everyone in the room. 
By the way, they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand, and a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer, which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures. 
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting. 
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. 
So there's another thing that comes up with basics. 
But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library. 
JA: So these are -- as far as we can tell -- classical whistleblowers, and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us. 
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. 
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. 
And to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff. 
I can share that with my friends, with my physician. 
This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli. 
I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro." 
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent, is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. 
Beautiful, because it has symmetry. 
They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. 
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. 
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing. 
A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head. 
The force of India, and then China, and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt. 
Maybe I'll feel good myself. 
Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own, then to sit and to stand and to walk, but my body was now divided vertically. 
It was cancer. It was the bad kind. 
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. 
So you can open this one. 
For a variety of reasons they're dangerous, but we feel that OOI, this Ocean Observatory Initiative, which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund, has the potential to really transform things. 
And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story. 
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert. 
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. 
Incidentally, we see just one octave. 
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up. 
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height. 
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so. 
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing, that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around. 
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental. 
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. 
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. 
Using the very first telephone, Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens. 
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. 
Now one other thing happened around this same time. 
These stories of his life, converted to data. 
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. 
We'll act as though we don't know each other. 
That is, they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest. 
But it cannot do it alone. 
And third, while they're in this paddock they are, of course, defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field. 
So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. 
I mean, how nice is that? 
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around. 
How did Hippomenes beat her? 
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music. 
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. 
(Applause) I'm going to start here. 
It wasn't my culture, and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it, but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it, it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture. 
That's because it's cheaper. 
Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much. 
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between industrial production and peer production." 
And that's green. If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass. 
These plants occur in great diversity, over 28,000 species around the world. 
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff. 
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself. 
It is February and not lying is impossible." 
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. 
There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question: How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad to very good? Second, an activity question: What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV? 
But just looking up with the naked eye, you really don't need one. 
Ten, jack, queen, king, ace. 
That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing. 
(Snoring) (Honk) Puffuffuff, what? 
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition, so I'm training a lot. 
These are happy vocalizations. 
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. 
But they basically created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings, and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. 
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer. 
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever. 
And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive, we really understand what brains are. 
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball, and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. 
It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right? 
Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. 
Now, one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do, in general. 
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful. 
Did design do this? 
So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million. 
One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing. 
But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity. 
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent. 
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds? 
But the orchestra were wowed as well, and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces. 
Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us, with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years. 
There is our star pupil, this labrador, who taught a lot of us what a state of play is, and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there. 
This is Kanzi. 
Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex. 
And at less than a five-year payback, all of a sudden this becomes very economic So you don't have to just want to have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these. 
Now this is the most frightening thing to me. 
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed. 
Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit. 
Now we've switched to critical mass. 
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos, that's a taxi, and you have police on them. 
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness. 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor. 
So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines. 
That is our profession, even historically it's the same, even now we are doing the same. 
And they've thought, "Oh, what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that." 
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps. 
That looks like this. 
Coffee is Uganda's major export. 
There are people who don't want to make eye contact. 
And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers, they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology. 
As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia, because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters. 
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world. 
It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas. 
(Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack) (Applause) Thank you very much. 
And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years, Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad, their daughters as much as their sons, in the same way that, say, Christians name their daughters Grace, and Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti, which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship. 
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. 
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn. 
(Laughter) In the long run, of course, it would also make it possible for us to move out there. 
It's a picture by Paul Klee. 
One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. 
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. 
You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself. 
But it's the best music making, like this. 
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging. 
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. 
Actually, life forms produce things that kill themselves. 
In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked in Harare city, leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside. 
And on the branches you have library material growing. 
And that's the question I'd like to ask you. 
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that, you go somewhere else. 
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack, your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. 
We're all HIV-positive. 
And Paula Radcliffe at that point says, "I'm done. Go." 
I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. 
But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who, like Celine, were left to their own devices once the research had been completed. 
I called my parents up. 
Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. 
To our surprise, one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum. 
I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke, I write in my book, and she said to me, "Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless. 
In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly. 
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high, which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north. 
But I have now a message to the ladies. 
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors. 
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital. 
Two things. 
Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. 
First, transport. Here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport, and people often say, "Oh, yes, technology can answer everything. 
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. 
It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage. 
As Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities. 
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups. 
CP: There are, certainly. 
And in the developing world overall, That figure is 40 to 50 percent. 
And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. 
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. 
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality. 
Well, amongst the 100 who do have the disease, the test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive. 
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience and, say, increase your price tag. 
We're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording, presenting, processing information. 
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time. 
And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today, so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing. 
But others turned this issue on its head, taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. 
(Laughter) And it goes together without any bolts. 
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically. 
All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. 
So there's something super interesting about natural systems. 
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field, and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background, kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom, and we'll put it down here to red. 
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market. 
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington." 
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. 
But there are a lot of similarities. 
(Music) But, what if ... 
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati, who are over in Tarawa, the westernmost group. 
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do. 
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. 
CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous, and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down without seeing 10, 11 and 12. 
Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball. 
Despite all that power, all that wealth, he was alone when he finally died -- his ultimate terror realized. 
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. 
So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind, but the city needs us. 
Where is the Small Hadron Collider? 
That's the credit card number, that's the expiration date, that's the security code, and that's the name of the owner of the card. 
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company." 
There is a potential to do good as well. 
And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces. 
So they go around and do art installations like this. 
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. 
A second, of course, is that, for some people, these become truly disabling, and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20. 
So, where should we be putting the money? 
But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them. 
How are we going to handle insurance? 
(Laughter) So at this point -- at this point she's noticed me, but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. 
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box. 
After 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body, and the internal bleeding stopped. 
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you, just please stop protesting in public." 
Thank you very much. 
It actually is a Japanese beetle. 
There is no possibility that this was going to happen. 
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone. 
Right? Good. 
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. 
Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region -- for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters," when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got the date wrong, but that's okay. (Laughter) It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that. 
They're everywhere. 
And I think that's just a horrible thing. 
The final toll of hostages is a little unclear, but it's certainly a few more than that, because there were other people who died over the next few days. 
How many birds am I hearing? 
(Video) And that may be just the beginning! 
And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law. 
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know, it's not working very well, so it's walking like this, and we can move the arm, you know, that way. 
Had the children eaten boiled sweets? 
Here on the model you see the predator attacking. 
Here are gender, age, weather, location. 
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it. 
We are running out of what we need. 
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time, should be very concerned about this deplorable situation. 
Because I know as a doctor, if someone comes to me with Stage I disease, I'm thrilled -- we can often cure them. 
And the idea is that what one does, is to take the device, you dip it, you develop the color, you take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory. 
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth." 
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. 
Forget it, they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. 
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions, in bigger arenas. 
BG: Now what about the money? 
Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China, and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou second-hand trade center, and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going? 
And the one I'm working on right now, which is -- because I'm right in the middle of it, and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers. 
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top. 
He's stung. 
And here you simply burn it. 
This is from the first two seconds. 
Child: Oh, that is so cool. 
And then it got stranger. 
There we are today. 
And so, here's what's happened in Brazil. 
We haven't reached that other shore, and still our sense of pride and commitment, unwavering commitment. 
And when people came to me, rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw -- I was like a living ghost -- they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives. 
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives. 
Take a square one there, first. 
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees, two young children were wounded. 
You know, research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. 
And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe, and they're known as very fierce, they're known as "auca." 
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for. 
Who sends whom a text message? 
On the left-hand side, I had the context of those little houses, and I tried to build a building that fit into that context. 
But this is it, this is the oil in the world. 
Because we want Africa to be rich. 
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector. 
But they typically use it to light up the screen. 
It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys. 
My office folds away, easily hidden. 
Sunni, let's just remind them. 
"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang, is one of his poems. 
But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. 
God knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history, we need it now. 
I had a very charming routine at the time, which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work, doing their crossword puzzles, watching television. 
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future? 
(Laughter) So I got the teddy bear and I said, "Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?" 
In the private sector, when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed-cost investment, it's called a billion-dollar company. 
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces. 
Five dollars can save a life. 
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane." 
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence. 
Two weeks later, you have something that looks like a liver. 
It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. 
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang, and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe. 
This is SymbioticA, and they've been working -- they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat -- and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat. 
One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more. 
But we also have stars and things as well. 
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough. 
I was dating this guy, right? 
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India. 
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up, instead of digging down. 
Because it's not failure itself that constrains us. 
And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it, reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory. 
It's really our first foray into this. 
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. 
If I really want the music to go there, the best way for me to do it is to listen. 
If you expand that out to think of a whole community, or all your employees in your company, you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be. 
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. 
And this particular painting, I think, represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era. 
I've never seen it. Have you? 
Well, you'd die if you did that. 
And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance. 
We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us. 
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. 
And it can come from biofuels. 
(Laughter) If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. 
And after a while you are calling you, and you are calling you, and you have this great communication network. 
We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy, but as we tacked back and forth, what we lost was two things: we were losing pulling power and direction. 
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book. 
And so, the obvious avenue for bio-remediation comes from organisms like this. 
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin. 
And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor, you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!" 
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules. 
Why are you posting these photos?" 
And I said, "Why would you do it this way?" 
(Laughter) Which tells you something about our place in the universe. 
Most world leaders didn't take notice, and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics." 
So, none of these cases are unique. 
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago, when Princess Diana died. 
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win. 
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act, video, audio, or peer pressure, we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. 
The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. 
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable. 
This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest. 
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford, have argued -- they've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game. 
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. 
Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? 
My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. 
And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people, we need to bend the rules. 
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already. 
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life. 
Now, I've talked about the patient as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract outside this room. 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. 
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains: How do I get people who hate poetry to love me? 
And they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide, programmed cell death, or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided. 
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. 
It's a dream. And it became a dream also. 
Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right? 
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men." 
If you have kids, you know what I mean. 
There is a cost of compression. 
And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like, a new version of atheism we could call Atheism 2.0. 
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation, which is two too many, because it stays with you for life. 
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident. 
But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda. 
This has been a lot of fun. 
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. 
KA: Well, I think that's interesting. 
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument? 
What is it? 
First time I'm feeling like a human being. 
In fact, what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger. 
CA: So, in your mind, five years time, someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface? 
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars. 
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep? 
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. 
I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me. 
So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. 
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, for them to talk. 
The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. 
This is a ubiquitous tool. 
I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change. 
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. 
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed, because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound. 
We'll think we're choosing these things, but the temes are making us do it. 
Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. 
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. 
Min's sister said to her parents, "In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars." 
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? 
It allowed to do all those things there. 
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust. 
I only need two things. 
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area, "You see that mountain over there?" 
(Laughter) But guys, if history has taught us anything, it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually. 
(Laughter) As a matter of fact, this is something that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with. 
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. 
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap. 
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas, I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation. 
Now you may think this is just a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride, just the world's biggest stunt. 
If they hadn't been crowded -- you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers, and you can see that very powerfully. 
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years. 
You place the cross into the ice, in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus, or sacred mountains of the Inca. 
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people -- and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits. 
Well, I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman, what he was like, but I see I have exactly half a minute. 
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day. 
And she told all the other people, and she said, "How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive?"
