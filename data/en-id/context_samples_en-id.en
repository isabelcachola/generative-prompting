And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball? 
We found that we have, on average, 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. 
So we always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. 
And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air. 
It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials, a detector and an imager. 
In the United States right now there are more suicides than homicides. 
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object, because they are generally rather nasty. 
Now what could this mean? 
Not like hot water made cold, or cold water turned hot, but water boiled off and becoming steam. 
That's how I've been trained. 
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. 
This time it's called the Facebook. 
(Applause) One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness, so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir. 
Make me laugh. Make me care. 
Absent desire, not going to happen. 
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. 
Instead, they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity. 
They look like they're frozen in some embrace. 
Prisoners are still born into prisoner-of-war camps long after the guards are gone. 
And here I am, talking to you. 
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many. 
And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes. (Laughter) And so, we made this game, and she got it. 
The brightest spot in China, which you can see on the edge of the outline here, is Hong Kong. 
That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible. 
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. 
There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are. 
If you did this, more people would save more. 
All right. 
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals. 
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. 
And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad -- that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad, except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity." 
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. 
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. 
And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives. 
Is it just about grievances? 
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born. 
One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. 
And in this period of time -- since that time -- as much oil, or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident, was spilled in this little area of the Amazon, and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move. 
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. 
Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion, so that we can have a more caring world? 
but look at this map, and you can watch this for, you know, two or three minutes. 
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?" 
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. 
But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there. 
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white, women, kids, all getting on a bike. 
(Laughter) People were walking around obsessed. 
We're like every big city in the world. 
A traditional midwife is a professional. 
We bring stories to the public. 
I lost and got airlifted. 
There is more of it than you think, actually. 
Now of course, as history has gone by, it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing. 
And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. 
They have to dig themselves out every day. 
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. 
And he said to me, "Oh no. 
It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have Internet connectivity even in very remote areas. 
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. 
And then you can just walk behind them and try them on. 
Yet, what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy, but actually the very nature of cyber weapons. 
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate, even though they don't know anything about urban planning: To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. 
And a small indulgence, like eating one scoop of ice cream, is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. 
I just observed. 
And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. 
But it's not benign, because there's so much of it. 
So much so, that much of my work till that time was in the English language. 
(Applause) So we have a little bit of time available, so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task. 
I was working in an office in London as a management consultant. 
So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo. 
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. 
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli. 
Now, what we need is, we need people who will be able to scale them up. 
We did not know about this life system. 
Two, in a hundred years, thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors. 
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document, and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update. 
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials. 
We've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin. 
(Applause) India's not unique. 
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships. 
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction. 
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm. 
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup, he thought it would be used for, you know, train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups. 
Guys, this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing. 
It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure. 
But they can't. 
Where has all the aid gone? 
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. 
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started. 
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways. 
In May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. 
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. 
(Laughter) The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time, sitting in their homes, one day in a week. 
(Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. 
But I would say this: I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. 
And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it, they would have learned how it actually works, rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. 
But also, Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. 
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today, to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause) It is part of corn's scheme for world domination. 
We're also a species of storytellers. 
You get that, and it's like a slap in the face. 
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment. 
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences. 
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate. 
How come you don't give him this? 
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. 
Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways. 
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. 
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door. 
That's all I'm getting paid for this? 
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science, and said, "It doesn't matter how you make a computer." 
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation, and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. 
For me it was a new discovery. 
If the government wants to find out how you voted, they won't be able to. 
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us, and then we'll use the paper for verification. 
You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half. 
And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. 
Back in 1995, we got a new wing next to the museum. 
We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. 
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it. 
Oops, I turned the wrong way. 
He turns four tomorrow." 
And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow. 
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. 
He's my donor. 
But my educated mother became a teacher. 
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus. 
Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. 
And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public. 
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist. 
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. 
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff. 
This is a crowd that does know what it is, so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right? 
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands? 
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. 
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species. 
This is a domain of something that seems impossible, which can actually be done, simply by putting additional constraints. 
Go to the website. Look at the audit results. 
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. 
We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones. 
But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics, the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. 
In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council, which means it's very difficult to get a resolution on Syria, and we're setting ourselves up again for failure. 
But we need to be very clear about how little that means. 
So that's really how vaccines work. 
I'll give you the short answer. 
He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity. 
But with new or better vaccines for malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia, diarrhea, flu, we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. 
As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened. 
You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. 
Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence. 
It takes its inspiration in form from life. 
I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. 
And if you look closely at these ballot forms, you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. 
It's kind of like an evolution machine. 
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners. 
You know, rocket designers who use solar panels or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts -- wow, that's a lot of power. 
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo, but I do know the fungus is down there. 
With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. 
So we’re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again. 
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness." 
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. 
If the whole world would deploy them, you would save hundreds of power plants. 
What about the visual context? 
And I was really surprised when I started to do this, to see that, in fact, even those people who were advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that. 
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher, said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue, honor, goodness, but we no longer have a system by which to connect them." 
You can take it really, really far. 
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin. 
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. 
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. 
This is a bowhead whale. 
I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever. 
So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. 
And he said it such a long time ago. 
So that was a big wake-up call in the 1980's. 
I was eating olives with pie. 
We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. 
And so, that decision to work with his friends -- now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started. 
Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. 
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?" 
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. 
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. 
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference. 
I mean, it's leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned. 
And I was able to attract really, really good people, people who share my passion for science and service to society, not science and service for career building. 
And I entered competitions for a long time. 
These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and what it does -- the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. 
And I chose two people to be, and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. 
And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again, and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time. 
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television where you can do something." 
And based on David's initial promising results, which were paid with seed funds at MIT, I was able to attract major research funding from the private sector and the federal government. 
A key plank is accountability, so teams use information radiators, these large boards in which everybody is accountable. 
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&amp;D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. 
On the competitiveness front, we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. 
Now someday, with a billion point three people getting richer, they are going to be bigger than the United States. 
This is a heterogeneous community. 
But beyond the staggering numbers, what's truly important from a global health point of view, what's truly worrying from a global health point of view, is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives, and remember, we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions, medicines, psychological interventions, and social interventions, can make a vast difference. 
And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently, you can really change things. 
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. 
And that potential, that powerful potential, is also our potential, of you and me. 
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility. 
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school, they're in family and community, what you also need, definitely, is more on the right hand side. 
So their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different, and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police. 
No petrochemicals in the pavement. 
So, this is a map of 714 students and their friendship ties. 
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"? 
But it's also about producing a language to describe this. 
No, that's what I thought. 
But we're really, really happy about who they are. 
And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. 
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. 
After finishing his bedtime rituals, he looked at me and he asked a question: "Mommy, are we bad people?" 
But anyone who's ever had, or knows, small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms. 
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today, is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture, millions of them, every season, in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water. 
Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor. 
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid, discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. 
The landscape is incredible. 
And then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean? 
Have a look. 
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed, some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food. 
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had. 
I had lots of titanium put in me, cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way. 
(Applause) One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film -- in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here, Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music, this idea that there is a narrative line, and that music exists in time. 
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive, so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been. 
That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech. 
And then we find some outliers, some things that lie beyond the cloud. 
And then you have other stories, unseen. 
But this is a nice, slender, very bad pest. 
Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise. 
(Laughter) This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. 
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. 
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. 
This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. 
So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. 
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister." 
And I understand what you're asking. 
It's getting blunter and blunter. 
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones. 
Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working, by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. 
And in papercutting, you have the drawing as the structure itself. 
Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up. 
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. 
We didn't let the stores know we were coming. 
You have stop signals -- we have up to eight stop signals. 
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today. 
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic, ridiculous, maybe even hopeless, but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay, and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work, if that's what you call it. 
30 percent of our households gave. 
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga? 
And the aurochs was like the bison. 
Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. 
So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope. 
But here, Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. 
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation. 
Is any of this your responsibility today? 
Play's essential. 
To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I read through the literature on anthropology, on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches. 
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split. 
(Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, "I gotta go." 
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. 
And he's teaching her how to browse. 
Slowly ideas lead to ideology, lead to policies that lead to actions. 
They have here Singapore. 
My work spirals from the micro to the macro level, excavating hidden histories. 
Now, this one is a little bit trickier. 
And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described, the power shift represented by transition among states, the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states, we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. 
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. 
Still here, child death per 1,000 on that axis. 
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius. 
This is the Ministry of Justice. 
There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it. 
Now you may have seen in the news recently, they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the Transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks. 
It's a way of using the language between actual people. 
But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. 
And it's not an easy movement because, to have this kind of movement, you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. 
So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. 
And the amazing thing was that bounce, that dip, lined up almost precisely with when each word was born -- word after word, systematically. 
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on. 
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all, is a master's degree. 
(Laughter) Is that a good way to play ping-pong? 
I'm the boss and I know better than you. 
Most people assume we use Photoshop. 
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. 
She's a technology leader and instructional leader. 
(Music) So if Christian played a note -- like play an F. 
It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone. 
The thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or your mind can be wired to be more social. 
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. 
That's the responsibility of architects. 
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux, and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing." Right? 
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico. 
So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not, we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence, we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor, dozing cow. 
The inventors don't know what the invention is. 
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this: There's jellyfish, there's squid, there's a whole lot of different crustaceans, there's even fish that can do this. 
Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. 
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. 
Now the big brain did this also with cooking. 
(Laughter) Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. 
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one. 
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers? 
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader, a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity, takes away a choice that people in the economy want. 
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere, and this area in blue, which shows a depression of about four miles, was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. 
It doesn't have a name yet. 
And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy. 
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. 
What can we do with just one person's data? 
MS: It's like, who do I want to be? 
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth. 
What happens is that circular logic takes over. 
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth, a typical growth cycle for us, and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse. 
So we’re very good, when acting out a solution, at spotting whether something lacks authenticity. 
Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on. 
It's hard. There's no doubt about it. 
In 1998, I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life" and I was completely hooked on screenwriting. 
Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London? 
My father so appropriately put it, that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species." 
The white here are countries which cannot be classified, because one religion does not reach 50 percent or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason. 
The collaborative effort was fabulous. 
What about the water?" 
Hey, yeah! 
This is me being inspired by my first tutor, my mom, and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to 200 students at Stanford University. 
Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo, anywhere where they could find a job that measured up to their educational attainment, because in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there. 
A water bottle: You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water. 
The baby was delivered through a C-section, but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia, a loss of oxygen to the brain. 
I would drive it and demand things from it. 
And then, following this advice, we start with this lowly, humble NAND gate, and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set, a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine, a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK." 
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see, a useful stereotype about you all. 
Thank you very much. 
Otherwise that would introduce bias. 
I can use it for something else. 
(Sneezing sound) Bless you. 
Or let's try asking about, I don't know, the International Space Station. 
You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. 
"You see that pier on the lake out there? 
Very simple example. 
And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white. 
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life, uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family. 
It doesn't work. 
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof. 
(Applause) but in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other methods. 
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. 
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things. 
They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them, it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. 
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world, must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world. 
The tricks of magic have one special element. 
It's got nutrients in it. 
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs. 
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive? 
By the end of the century, there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. 
That would be simple. Then we know what to do. 
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature. 
So my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape? 
Today's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes. 
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah. 
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for? 
And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year. 
All of these concepts, as kind of rhetorically florid as they are, share this basic assumption, which is that an idea is a single thing, it's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment. 
Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles, so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles. 
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend. 
And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. 
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now, not for an action prediction, but for a moral judgment. 
We need national responses. We need local government responses. 
The syndrome, the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction. 
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha. 
These electric cars are beautiful. 
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. 
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years. 
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case. 
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. 
Now this is not a religious garment, nor is it a religious statement. 
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean. 
But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion. 
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. 
Having goals is important, because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction, you need to know where you're going and why. 
I was also asked to leave the organization, a cartoonists' organization in America, that for me was my lifeline. 
So, we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. 
This is challenging work to do. 
We need to move Mexican society, the members of society who are at this level, to the next level, which is action. 
Ban is blank. 
A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. 
The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe. 
So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways. 
but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. 
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them -- this is amazing. 
You can build cathedrals out of stones, you just have to know what it does. 
A week later, they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date. 
It scratches on the soil. 
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood. 
Who gets surgery and who doesn't? 
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. 
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. 
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material. Again, a stop-up. 
He's out of office today. 
If we can put those two together in a safe space, get them to work together, we can deliver public goods right now, or in extremely short supply. 
Here, an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper. 
Since we have an extra minute here, I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds, which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. 
And the minute they did that, the behavior in those daycare centers changed. 
Sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time. 
They were lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said: "We don't want this." 
Now let me turn to a second question, a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important. 
So to sum up, on the one hand, when a possible enemy announces they're building a cyberwar unit, you don't know whether it's for attack or defense. 
Do you know what I wanted to be? 
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought, "How could we have predicted that?" 
Thank you. 
We don't need a reason. 
You know what? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. 
(Laughter) And it's a power park. 
The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens. 
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. 
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online, inspire each other to greatness. 
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors. 
And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off, and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. 
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. 
And another story of the cylinder begins. 
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad? 
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program. 
And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk -- it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable. 
But we activate targets in the brain, different ones, using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. 
To weigh any more than that, it has to give up neurons. 
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet, and he showed this x-ray photograph. 
So that's how I decided [to do] the same. 
(Laughter) In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. 
We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system. 
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. 
If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening. 
That's cool, huh? 
Women typically listen expansively. 
Let me tell you where I got it. 
Let's start with the water. 
So it is a very big challenge, and it requires the total support of the international community, with the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support, because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change. 
Now, Evan is new to this system, so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. 
The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations, and we can't have that. 
And if I want to control him, I can just drive. 
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her? 
So, given our new kind of science, is there a general way to use it to make technology? 
Audience: (Shouts) (Laughter) (Shouts) (Laughter) Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. 
This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. 
AV: We did. 
And openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges, but it's quite a basic thing. 
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music -- a two-way street. 
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. 
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West. 
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. 
I mean, that's just incredible humility. 
Rap, of course, rap -- free-style. 
(Laughter) So there they are. 
That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly. 
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status. 
But we were all so nervous. 
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?" 
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning. 
It's a nice description because it's starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones, the plants that are just able to live. 
And when I stand here in front of all of you, and the people who will watch these things, I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met, that there is a possibility that our world could unite, that we could come together as one, that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues, brought about by individuals. 
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy? 
What we don't know is the exact, precise, immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns -- winds, ocean currents, precipitation rates, cloud formation, things that bear on the health and well-being of billions of people. 
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up. 
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested. 
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura, 50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border. 
We're not asking meaningful metrics. 
And the answer is a fair amount -- more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore. 
It speaks so eloquently to the problem. 
So actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people. 
Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. 
The tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park. 
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote, "In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. 
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. 
She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. 
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. 
We need that kind of information, we need more of it, and then we need to guide policy. 
And so one time I was in a beauty salon, and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. 
(Laughter) Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy -- actually, to show that my first question, if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true. 
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within. 
I have work to do." 
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions. 
So I appeal to you. 
Poop can cook your dinner. 
(Applause) See, I have a legacy in South Central. 
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane, it's escorted there by a series of armed guards. 
It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter) Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. 
But, oh well. In the end, however, and this is really amazing, for each of those 10 TEDTalk clusters that I submitted, I actually received meaningful summaries. 
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves. 
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. 
It's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time. 
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour. 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. 
I started doing fashion. 
Thank you. 
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad." 
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. 
What can we do about this? What are the solutions? 
I was the head of a college department teaching games, so, again, it was sort of a real job, and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them. 
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept. 
(Laughter) Obvious, right. 
He did not think so, however, but his coworkers did an intervention and they said, "You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die." 
And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. 
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. 
Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities. 
They post projects, so they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books," or "I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope." 
Well once again, women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem. 
Number one: this incursion into your land these past 20 years, and before, the reason anyone is interested in your land, and particularly the United States, it's oil. 
♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫ Well, your musician friend will stop you and say, "You know, the theme music for your data revolution, that's an opera, that's Wagner. 
There's the availability heuristic, which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. 
There's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America, and it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis, when, you know, mass consolidation, mass exodus of small farmers in this country. 
Again, Venice is extraordinary for that. 
Here, there isn't really an option. 
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different. 
By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from. 
And it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car. 
While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. 
Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date. 
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. 
But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon, that is soot. 
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic. 
Watch it carefully. 
Does this sound familiar? 
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. 
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. 
If we take the toothbrush -- I don't think about the toothbrush. 
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. 
So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. 
It means it's determined and effective, but not violent. 
They buy products on demand. A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive. 
But they localize it. 
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know, hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. 
I didn't use that stare very often, but I do have it in my repertoire. 
Twenty-five billion. 
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork. 
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke, afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage, and felt that they were bound to lose. 
And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets. 
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision. 
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. 
You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth, and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation. 
A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time. 
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? 
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl, and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness. 
(Laughter) You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. 
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live." 
Some people must make more money, some others less. 
It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. 
Three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape, the answer to the sum. 
It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate; they've got the tools; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. 
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field. 
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves, and thought about ourselves. 
To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor. 
And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. 
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant. 
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. 
(Music) (Applause) KB: Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent, wonderful Earth. 
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item. 
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him, and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him. 
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. 
So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. 
A lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford, and actually slightly bigger than that. 
Clearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? 
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. 
How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write? 
Boat got a bit dinged up, so did I. 
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste. 
One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. 
Alright, my favorite part. 
Children became more competent, and less helpless. 
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. 
We need to see what they can do for us. 
You really do have to go and see his latest film, "Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible. 
We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements, and if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground. 
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else? 
There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals, but the evidence for people could not be clearer. 
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said, "Greg, do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did?" 
Sometimes I'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency, even ease. 
He went around once, he went around twice, he went around thrice. 
Last year, Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation, heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. 
Now I don't know how to do that, but this is TED, and I think the TED community is capable of anything. 
And the question I asked was, "Why me? Why me?" 
So you take a look out in the real world, and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself. 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. 
It is able to move around its environment. 
We divided our world up with lots of categories. 
And so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas, hydro-electric, which in most places is maxed-out -- and nuclear. 
We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. 
And in six months they can become solar engineers. 
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?" 
He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt. 
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore -- we hire people to look at websites and tell you -- if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers, each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output, 
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring, and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself. 
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation, which is the new owner of TED. 
And of course, what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. 
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here. 
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. 
The 0.1 percent in the U.S. 
And I was really struck by how much it affected me. 
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions. 
I went outside what I thought I knew. 
And we keep sending more every day. 
It's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume. 
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this? 
(Laughter) And only from the air did I see the big picture. 
The vaccine effort though is really quite different. 
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there. 
It is more complex than this, but this will do. 
CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee. 
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted, and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. 
That is changing our business. 
Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas. 
Now I hope you enjoy the session. 
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water; it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater, and we have now a lot of intrusion there. 
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this, Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services. 
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. 
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff. 
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting. 
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. 
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster? 
Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind. 
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. 
And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II, and also welcomed to my official residence -- which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin," the house of the president -- members of the royal family, including, notably, the Prince of Wales. 
But of course, you cannot understand Venice if you just look at the city. 
And this is happening here. 
Thanks. 
And that's what the song is asking. 
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that. 
We need to rearrange the pattern. 
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera, and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. 
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. 
This actually became my creative obsession. 
By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. 
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s. 
Thank you. 
I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue. 
So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. 
I said, in exchange for education in how to paint, I will support them, and I started a company. 
"We are what we eat," could easily be described as, "We are what our cells eat." 
All right, so tie me to the mast." 
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. 
SP: I agree with the president. 
Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times, actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take, and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied, "Six hours -- if we live." 
I was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of America, five-and-a-half thousand square miles. 
(Thumping) Now it's gone. 
If you zoom in here, you can see North Korea, in outline here, which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors. 
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now. 
Yes, everyone in the room. 
They are scarce; they are expensive; and we only have a certain range of it. 
♫ There is no hope. ♫ ♫ There is no future. ♫ ♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫ ♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫ ♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫ ♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫ ♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫ ♫ There is no reconciliation ♫ ♫ and no collective compromise. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we want. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we all say. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫ 
These dwellings are called the yaodongs. 
What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available? 
But there's something else. 
So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. 
That is gone. 
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right? 
The problem, put in its simplest terms, is one of mathematics. 
And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. 
Judge Forer had to follow the law. 
And here's the truth: doodling is an incredibly powerful tool, and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn. 
So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. 
And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity, at least in the next few hundred years. 
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. 
(Laughter) But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online. 
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise. 
That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer. 
Where do we find the most species of ocean life? 
Do these organisms even have emotion-like states, or are they just little digital robots? 
So that is why I started working in disaster areas. 
Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either. 
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. 
And it actually never sheds those leaves, so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. 
But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing. 
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an area, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property. 
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj. 
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum. 
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie. 
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore. 
Of course, I had no hair and no immune system. 
I wonder how many of us have, or dare to have, such collaborators. 
E: [Laser noise] (Laughter) SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein. 
That realization ignited the idea of June 17, where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive. 
All right, so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind. 
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. 
And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan, the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles, and it's used those drones to kill 2,000 suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. 
There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system. 
I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali. 
It's actually quite user-unfriendly. 
You may think that's impossible. 
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. 
Insects, those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms. 
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. 
You've heard in the past several years, the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. 
That is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while, we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society. 
But through it all, look for a way to break out, to find a field and subject not yet popular. 
His flesh fuses with her flesh, her bloodstream grows into his body, and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac. 
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision. 
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. 
But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way, you get diamond, which is clear and hard. 
Bihar represents the challenge of development: abject poverty surrounded by corruption. 
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material? 
JS: Okay. Wet hands. 
If I flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses, I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads. 
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension. 
Only 60 years later, it travels at 80 percent of the speed of sound, and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust. 
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells. 
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other. 
I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. 
These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes, and we'll focus on them. 
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge. 
Before that time, people are left to their own devices. 
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony. 
Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved. 
There aren't many craters. 
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height. 
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture. 
So a little over a decade ago, two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down, OK. 
We did everything that letter told us to do, and still I know there must be more. 
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food. 
So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. 
Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War, where millions of men fought each other in the trenches, getting nowhere, making no progress, and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. 
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. 
"The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this: What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest? 
We stand in elections; we vote in elections; we observe elections. 
Word up, L-Dog. 
Since then -- it's been four decades now -- I've trained with the best in the field, performed across the globe, taught young and old alike, created, collaborated, choreographed, and wove a rich tapestry of artistry, achievement and awards. 
I know intimately that skin you are hitting. 
And when people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier and healthier patients. 
I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works. 
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. 
A-ha! 
Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please. 
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books, for example, having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model. 
(Laughter) And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- (Laughter) and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success, or gleeful calamity. 
So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group? 
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do. 
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. 
DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. 
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink. 
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help. 
(Laughter) And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. 
CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes. 
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. 
So I stayed up at night, and I talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table? 
Moreover, once we can do that, we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons. 
Now he's put together some thoughts: About half of that he'll cut, another half, perhaps in a very complex set of steps, taxes will be approved. 
It may have jeopardized short-term sales, but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty based on shared values. 
We have just to finish the story. 
But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects, but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs. 
(Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. 
What can we do here? 
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. 
I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience. 
Why do you think, those of you who voted this way, that the best flutes should go to the best flute players? 
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there, experiencing the sun's demise, but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria. 
In the old days of the silent movies -- Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable. 
I want to share some of that story with you, but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim-majority societies. 
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. 
MT: So over here is low tide, and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon. 
Texting has developed one from this slash. 
The worst, in 45. 
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. 
These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work. 
But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one? 
It is not like beautiful offices here, 20 patients, you're tired. 
The serif is not really in place. 
They're learning who they are. 
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world. 
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature. 
There's a lot of activity in China. 
I have become myself known. 
"Better immersion than to live untouched." 
(Laughter) Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it. 
It's the history of what we eat today. 
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. 
And eventually, you saturate the population. 
And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen. 
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up. 
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it. 
So that ice sheet is partly floating, and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat. 
And so, for example, there is in texting a convention, which is LOL. 
I checked the reports on this one. 
A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. 
I believe the government should do more, but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in is the right direction. 
(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep. 
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. 
By opening up our translation program, thousands of heroic volunteers -- some of them watching online right now, and thank you! -- have translated our talks into more than 70 languages, thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries. 
And that's that all the sensations, feelings, decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain. 
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember going to a demonstration where they basically, the demonstrator did something quite intriguing. 
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene. 
So when you put four. 
And I pressed her, and I asked her, "Why did you come back and get your care here?" 
The croc again continues to shake me. 
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends. 
So that's getting me excited. 
Who else can have these qualities more than children? 
Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions. 
Now check this out. 
And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections, or hospital-acquired infections, this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices. 
(Applause) (Applause) Thank you. 
How long have we been divergent from each other? 
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. 
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. 
It's about attention. It's about their image, not about the car. 
So they privately got advice from a famous lyricist, who I won't name, and he faxed them some suggestions. 
TH: These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. 
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code. 
The protocell moves. It encounters the food. 
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement. 
Robots touch something deeply human within us. 
It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. 
And you may wonder why. 
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply, is the mathematics that underlies an idea, and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it, which I want to share with you now. 
Try to spot the beehive. It's there. 
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent. 
We're using them for people, we're using them for places, we're using them for your products, we're using them for events. 
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas. 
We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state. 
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. 
And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. 
So what I'm showing you, from left to right, is how much activity there was in this brain region, and from top to bottom, how much blame people said that Grace deserved. 
(Laughter) Exact equivalent. 
Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president, or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues, a European-wide referendum where our citizens, as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties. 
But also, if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear, it leads to overreaction. 
(Laughter) There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it. 
And they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime. 
Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool, is cross-functional working is so amazing, why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on? 
It's in control. It's in power right now. 
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked. One more question. 
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand? 
So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. 
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it." 
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. 
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. 
There we are today. 
Therefore it's the exclusive preserve of an elite, talented body. 
You would hate to go to the ATM, take out 100 dollars and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills. 
His grandmother had two jobs. 
I'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track. 
The first is that, when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago, more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. 
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. 
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women. 
So we might have -- for the first time in our species -- feeling chases model, model chases reality, reality's moving -- they might never catch up. 
I said, "Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today, and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken." 
And so this was just an amazing experience. 
Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. 
From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation. 
In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. 
They communicate with other plants. 
And I think most of us will agree, well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. 
We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them -- buyer's remorse, basically. 
We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels." (Laughter) We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil. 
So they need a vector -- and this vector, it's normally an animal. 
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. 
Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves -- hopefully that search will work. 
No matter what level you look at, whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level, we see the same problem again and again. 
And he said, "Oh, that's great. 
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time? 
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care, to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it, without fear of our safety, or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product." 
In other words, the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds. 
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology. 
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens. 
And suddenly, without realizing it, you're seeing the world differently. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I think it was good advice. 
How do we transport an airplane to Mars? 
And in my book, I went into that question as well. 
At five minutes to six in the afternoon, we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam, the duck comes out of the museum, and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. 
And tribe leaders can do that. 
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you. 
And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic, meaning that it's changing all the time, so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too. 
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. 
PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy? 
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. 
And eventually she said to him "Well I'm going to get back in my car." 
I'm not an economist, very much not, but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation -- (Laughter) -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars. 
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. 
And in the same way that we cannot not communicate, we cannot not persuade. 
Research shows that 50 percent of children, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. 
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens. 
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years, much longer than it should have -- but once it was built, the results were striking. 
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range. 
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. 
Through Haiti Rewired, through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity, AIDG, there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. 
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that? 
It's in that context that I rescue children. 
But it has the ability to override our feelings. 
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well. 
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal. 
So the first way that we did this. 
"Shush, watch this." 
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely help people, because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. 
What happens to education in that context? 
I'd had something that was called foie gras. 
When it came to our atmosphere, however, it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term, because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen. 
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks. 
I opened my refrigerator on my own. 
You have to come into the world like Asanga did, who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after 12 years sitting in the cave. 
What has happened? 
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?" 
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner? 
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages. 
So you get Google, you get Amazon, you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets. 
Students may display captions in their native language. 
OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. 
There is, for example, a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world. 
Does it really matter that they're far away? 
So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level. 
And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools. 
(Applause) It's a small message from us, in our own small way to the enemies of humanity, of Islam, of South Asia, of India, and of Pakistan, that humanity will continue to bloom, irrespective of such dastardly attacks. 
One recharge, and one stores. 
In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds, I'm as dumb as a box of hammers. 
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. 
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. 
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this? 
Your job is only to be human. 
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian, went back into Italian Google. 
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound. 
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now." 
Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends, is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it. 
And at the time, she was miserable. 
I needed something to go that extra mile, and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four. 
When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning. 
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying -- and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes." 
(Laughter) And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more. 
So, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. 
At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird. 
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay. 
Bhutan's created the ultimate export, a new global currency of well-being, and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH. 
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research. 
It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. 
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that. 
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. 
And moreover, it has to work. 
And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama, which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis," — a charity I've worked with for years — "and you had a bucketful of lollipops. 
And two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour, which are against poisonous and rotten material. 
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime. 
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon, northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe. 
And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem. 
And the same with flowers. 
(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) (Applause) I have a tough job to do. 
The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century. 
Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. 
So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off, etc. 
For example, how much and where to use fire as a management tool? 
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display, my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. 
We love farmers' markets, we love small family farms, we talk about local food, we eat organic. 
There were people who raised a hue and cry, and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language. 
The second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance," the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting, any quarry worth taking. 
now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny -- in this way, we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain, the functional architecture of the brain. 
If you look at the registry, actually, a lot of the registered things in the E.U. 
They have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns. 
And I just love this guy. 
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company, I could have predicted the size of Walmart. 
I invite you into three recent stories of mine, which are about this way of looking, if you will, which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling. 
He took a leap of faith. 
We can also use cymatics for healing and education. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
Now having a large brain, as you know, is a big advantage, because you can actually influence your environment. 
There's one with a fragrance dispenser. 
Operating since 1875, it is the last functioning steel mill in the region. 
Make a decision and give me some blood. 
We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers. 
I told everyone: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, total strangers, and I'm here today because you all helped me. 
A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people. 
And we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other. 
It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go. 
This is a wonderful thing. 
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition, at least to me, which is the following: To doodle officially means to dawdle, to dilly dally, to monkey around, to make meaningless marks, to do something of little value, substance or import, and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing. 
So not only would he get me one, but I had to get two, and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers, which I did, and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money. 
I also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost. 
So, maybe we're in the throes of it. 
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other, they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten. 
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. 
The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages. 
Charlie: The cart's not part of the game. 
Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. 
This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute presented to Congress a few years ago. 
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications. 
And then, as if by magic, they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can. 
And there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image. 
Nothing else. 
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. 
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. 
That's somehow unprofessional and bad. 
My grandmother never let me forget his life. 
For this so-called "battle," 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. 
So the three-year-old does two things differently. 
Well, beforehand, everything is the same. 
And once again, two scientists have got a problem with noise. 
Are there men around that table? 
These economics I'm proposing, it's like 20th century medicine. 
So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good? 
Thank you. 
So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections. 
In fact, let's start right now. 
This is a photograph of the object. 
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up. 
But if we look at the fossil record, we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years. 
I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. 
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" 
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there. 
You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune. 
And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me, only a few months ago, to become a UNAIDS ambassador. 
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters. 
That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million, but world GDP per capita -- $200,000. 
At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization. 
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.

But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils, why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans? 
When you see them, they're something else, they're something else. 
Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self-driving cars and what they can do for the world. 
The first problem that we're facing is human health. 
So what did we find? 
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language. 
Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded, and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal? 
One of them is pattern recognition. 
It was Bihar all over again. 
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa, his country, the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus? 
Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this: The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to the organic ones. 
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. 
And it's not just water that this works with. 
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. 
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers, and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony. 
All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. 
(Applause) Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. 
And then you know what we do? We negotiate. 
And so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues. 
People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. 
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India. 
Raise your hands. 
So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city. 
And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually, how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity. 
Competition means, not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500, but within each of these units, there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. 
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. 
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. 
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip. 
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years. 
This family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right. 
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house to film her painting. 
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later. 
Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. 
So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. 
I have a bunch of other inventions. 
But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS. 
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games. 
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada? 
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water. 
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. 
Why? Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies. 
It's a hard, time-consuming labor, which they have to do for hours every week. 
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, "Oh, I could use it for this and this and this." 
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. 
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. 
And it really impressed me -- I met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience, and ended up with the demeanor that he had. 
My kids do that all the time. 
So we have some kind of primordial soup. 
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal. 
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task. 
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other." 
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece, and they're going into all kinds of devices. 
All the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment, at a pH of 11, life existed. 
Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo, depend in many ways on state patronage. 
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life? 
The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence, tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many, many different factors. 
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s -- that's what made us go back and work for them. 
They just want the sharing to go away. 
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it. 
Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. 
One was post-traumatic stress disorder. 
So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. 
And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV. 
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come. 
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger, as in riots. 
Now why is that? 
It's because it's a big problem, and it's complicated and messy. 
I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat. 
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it? 
The first day they would take a hike, and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. 
Without bribing the central cats, he can do nothing, only apologize. 
DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. 
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. 
That would be bad for economies and cities. 
Models eventually fade into the background. 
He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. 
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical. 
We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. 
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell. 
Cochrane understood that uncertainty, that fallibility, that being challenged, they hurt. 
It will sometimes be a lonely road. 
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, once said that, "It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education." 
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century, the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats, so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place. 
It's about two-thirds built out right now. 
And their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly. 
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. 
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. 
So you can imagine the scale of the effort. 
My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken. 
So how can they address this remaining water footprint? 
What have we learned? 
There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh, there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes, there's a Christian, there's a Sabian, there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council, what's wrong with the people that we chose?" 
This is a secret identity kit. 
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. 
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings. 
And I think here we can play a role. 
Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. 
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. 
This is a short video of how we did this project. 
And they could all sit and work together on those problems. 
I'll now proceed quickly, and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career. 
If the universe is not a fluctuation, why did the early universe have a low entropy? 
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more, you really experience it in a different way. 
Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race. 
One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome. 
And so it is not just what's happening to these people -- whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor, or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us; it's also the actual architecture of the ties around us. 
The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries, was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship. 
I had to just sit and watch. 
Now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to know that. 
So the idea was pretty simple. 
You've got to be able to make them all the time. 
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. 
You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?" 
It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual. 
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. 
So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. 
But because of what Snow did, because of this map, because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map, we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people, cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. 
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. 
But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people. 
Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals. 
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. 
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. 
If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA. 
And guess what? 
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings. 
And some people think that string theory is tough. 
Instead, she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture, nation and heritage. 
Given that it was such a vast civilization, you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings, and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings. 
And so that didn't work. 
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now. 
And I'm a very nerdy doctor. 
But this does not follow any of the usual trends. 
When a leader says, "Not under my watch," everything begins to change. 
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms, just for the Carnival and the Knife. 
And antimony for the bottom layer. 
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. 
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that? 
Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly. 
That is not a good idea. 
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there. 
Maybe 10 times more. 
But that's what he had all his life, people walking away from him. 
And this is what my mother took me to when I was five. 
But when I saw this, I was really fascinated, because it seemed lifelike. 
But in order to try and explain the whole thing, I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it, so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion, and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other, but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around. 
The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. 
OK now, more importantly, had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s, had we seen this disease, had we understood exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved? 
This is an ecological network. 
This is the transformation that took place. 
At the age of four, he was installed as the 14th Dalai Lama. 
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. 
Walk the talk. 
And they were full of all kinds of jargon. 
They started a public campaign that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet." 
American parents were more likely to say things like, "What if? What if?" 
You can do this in groups as well. 
Now the largest economic region in the world. 
Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities. 
I learned this from Spider-Man. 
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. 
Let's just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. 
Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. 
And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that's why it's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine, which is a computer. 
If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs, you would cut the ties to me, and the network would disintegrate. 
And one of the tools I like personally is using video. 
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion? 
What happens if two cars share that data, if they talk to each other? 
Not only cities that we're building, but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors. 
But it's not quite like the adult brain. 
I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. 
And we get this wordscape, except now words are not assembled in my living room. 
Remember, they don't study English. 
And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence. 
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 
So this graph here, I'm going to show you now. 
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. 
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election. 
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. 
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. 
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway, and it told me to go via Guernsey. 
Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. 
Raise your hands. Let me see. 
And we also have to be aware of the issues. 
And something I realized quite early on was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and -- in fact, more fundamentally than that -- ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways. 
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. 
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. 
Yet, the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. 
Now, my brother and I, we're musicians and music producers. 
That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. 
You have every change that was made in the city. 
And he's able to change the lives of so many other young people. 
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 
One strand can be copied directly, and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. 
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person gets in contact with the network, and then gets an identity. 
Come on: those masterpieces ... 
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. 
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: (Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active? 
This is Osorio, he's our secretary of urban affairs. 
I don't try to design the toothbrush. 
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture. 
You see, even if the idea of the election is perfect, running a countrywide election is a big project, and big projects are messy. 
I'm hoping we can, for example, use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly, and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. 
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute. 
This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms, but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems. 
Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. 
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face, many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced, mostly haven't come from individuals, they've come from organizations, some of them bigger than countries, many of them capable of affecting hundreds, thousands, even millions of lives. 
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical. 
And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways. 
I mean, it was wonderful stuff. 
So, you know, it's sort of a complicated thing. You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing. 
That was all done on a machine that looks like this. 
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector. 
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 
But if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel, the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley, where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located, especially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this just in the middle of the desert. 
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut. 
But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter. 
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. 
And let the next Olympics save some lives. 
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. 
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati? 
When time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth, people are constantly preparing, trying to soak up all the information they possibly can, taking risks, exploring. 
So this was the state of London in 1854, and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions, and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people, it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow, who was a local doctor in Soho in London, who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease, and had basically convinced nobody of this. 
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now. 
You exaggerate your fears, and you're terrified about the humiliation of defeat. 
And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys." 
It's the sensible shoe of public address. 
It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. 
So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he's lying there and he says, "I really understand, and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself. 
Well, what about our brain then? 
And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other. 
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent. 
Of course one can make a biological argument. 
He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. 
And sometimes we make real plans. 
(Laughter) It's a blind computer. 
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier, the big decisions in my life would have been made for me -- meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in; I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did; and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected. 
Applause for Dan. 
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign? 
Well, in most places, utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison. 
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. 
So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into. 
So that's what we've done. 
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it. 
So I started to get intrigued. 
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently?" 
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny. 
It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field. 
It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again. 
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form. 
We line that up with data that we record from a professional driver, and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable. 
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. 
Let's actually try that. 
That made sense. And they agreed. 
(Music) (Applause) CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today, so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. 
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them. 
Today, we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the Industrial Revolution. 
That's exactly what we must do. 
But to make them palatable, we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this. 
Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house, he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply, but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with. 
And we need to save dinner. 
And somebody said to him, "Well what's the point of these, Heinrich? 
But we don't just experience them, we show them. 
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now, because I don't want to look at me on the screen. 
And let's just pick out a few elements. 
But I -- I'm optimistic. 
Even more worrying for the Americans, in December 2008 the holiest of holies, the IT systems of CENTCOM, the central command managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these: plain but infected USB keys. 
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can't understand it very well. 
And she said -- I'll never forget -- "It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time." 
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world. 
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates. 
Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options. 
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples, and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple. 
Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second. 
I asked them to produce a little movie about it. 
And probably the easiest way to show you that, is to show you this graph. 
But what of those big predators, those fashionable species, that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier? 
So, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century -- the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century, because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world. 
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic. 
I thought, well what the hell's that about? 
The researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals. 
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening. 
As we know, babies are born without their full muscle development, and that includes the brain. 
That changed my life quite dramatically, and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers. 
So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in. 
Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. 
And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know: "What are you doing in America?" 
They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters. 
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects. 
Because what I began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this. 
Mill. 
I don't think so. 
You bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way. 
We went from 14 percent to seven percent. 
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. 
I'll show you a few examples of this now. 
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family. 
I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. 
My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight. 
And you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. 
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower, except that like almost all whistle-blowers, he wasn't a crank at all, he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. 
Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize. 
This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. 
Okay, thank you so much. 
You have the green for example, that corresponds to tactile information, or the blue that corresponds to auditory information. 
And we encourage anybody to join this effort. 
(Laughter) Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam, you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend. 
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you." 
But you have to maintain it. 
And the answer, of course, that we keep being given is as follows: we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9/11, and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security. 
(Laughter) There went that theory down the trashcan of history. 
These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. 
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound -- create sound. 
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why? And finally, would you be able to -- and you can sort of scribble it, if you like -- scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets' orbits? 
But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. 
We are everyone. We are no one. 
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. 
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? 
It's real. 
Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes, and enforced his command with great brutality. 
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this Council of Dads that Linda said, what we were talking about, it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off. 
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. 
We had a bit of a battle of wills. 
What are we supposed to do? 
I even started to get some hate mail. 
Most of all, though, it affects the patients, and that could be you, it could be me. 
Shortly after, my parents got separated, and I came to Turkey with my mom. 
You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities. 
And if we could do that, we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide, in all of our countries for polio. 
Fortunately, I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team, and that's the only way that this work can really occur. 
Austria, a neighboring country, slightly similar, slightly different. 
Maybe no one's really crazy. 
(Laughter) And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. 
While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building. 
"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you": an ethos that should now be applied globally. 
What paper went into that flap? 
I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. 
And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward, there were moments of incredible depth and richness, of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before. 
Unfortunately, there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better, and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. 
So here. 
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 
Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution. 
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. 
To climate change that would be like Kyoto. 
It's the hollowing out of small towns. 
So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. 
But the really interesting thing about it is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. 
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders, you give your money to Partners In Health, and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber, and they'll helicopter things out and in. 
And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. 
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out. 
This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. 
So an entire philosophy, a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries, goes away. 
Thank you. 
I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. 
Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women? 
(Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren," human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself. 
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement. 
Why should we get away from those arguments? 
The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. 
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence -- and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. 
Why is that? 
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me and where they're from." 
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being. 
Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks, and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it, you're like most of us. 
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square. 
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are, but as we are. 
Now, this may surprise you. 
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. 
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts, and that looked like the end of the story, but sometime last year, a young couple got married. 
(Applause) And perhaps more important, I am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son. 
It's natural connective tissue. 
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. 
(Laughter) Now, that's a good printing job. 
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out. 
This is a polio vaccine. 
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect. 
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do. 
But how to reach it? 
We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. 
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter. 
There's an environmental component. 
Over the next 200 years we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap, and then back again. 
(Laughter) And since it was near lunch time, they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch. 
This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery. 
This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, for which humans have no natural immunity. 
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. 
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing. 
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism. 
It lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise. 
You can respond. Up, right? 
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf. 
(Laughter) It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward. 
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell. 
Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough. 
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father. 
He said, "We often issue these permits to do research in our waters, but usually we get a note two or three years later, or a reprint. 
So every time you think about moving these people around, you think about high-capacity transportation. 
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. 
(Laughter) I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job. 
Our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us. 
Karachi, Pakistan. 
But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them, all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world. 
NT: Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear, and the coal deposits are exhausted? 
We are not using fossil energies. 
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. 
It actually is a Japanese beetle. 
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue? 
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. 
But in order for me to explain what that is, I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. 
Now go ahead and cut. 
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it, and I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working. 
But nevertheless, the system has moved in a more liberal direction, moved in a more democratic direction. 
I said, I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. 
We announced the class on July 29th, and within two weeks, 50,000 people had signed up for it. 
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. 
Eventually, I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica. 
A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads? 
And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that. 
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it. 
And, like water, they will find cracks in any set of rules. 
Here we have the description of the order of nature. 
And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. 
Something revolutionary happened a little while ago, at the same facility. 
They were blank on one side, and on the other side I listed some simple instructions. 
(Applause) Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ... 
And that was fascinating to me as a game designer, because it never occurs to me, like, should I make the game about this difficult topic or not? 
But if you zoom out, if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago that's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. 
Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape. 
Well, you still have choice. 
It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. 
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nanoscale. 
And somehow kids don't do that anymore. 
And we care about right and wrong. 
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. 
And the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there. 
And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing, which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills, and that means that they're able to do two things. 
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. 
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community; this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet. 
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. 
(Laughter) I've always wanted to say that in this country. 
If you were Middle Eastern -- Abdel-Magied -- you had to send out 64 percent, and if you're Italian, you're pretty lucky, you only have to send out 12 percent more. 
And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units. 
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell. 
RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. 
Thank you. 
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. 
Forty percent of them have gained even more. 
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force, which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence. 
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. 
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population, that's a food crisis. It's global in nature. 
And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day. 
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. 
(Music) So you see, he played this note. 
Car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us, and safer. 
The High Line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've taken a playful take where, instead of framing advertisements, it's going to frame people in views of the city. 
And we need to learn that principle here in the States, because we have a big debt. 
"From 52 to 48 with love" was a project around the time of the last election cycle, where McCain and Obama both, in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation, and I was like, "What the hell does that look like?" 
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio, which includes the genus that has cholera in it. 
(Applause) The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good. 
(Music) In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul. 
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing. 
(Applause) I have Excel. 
In the age of globalization, we moved on. 
Whilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology, something that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between. 
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety. 
The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. 
What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. 
That's the difference. 
There is now a cement manufacturing company starting in the United States called Calera. 
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. 
They have to, in fact, make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero, otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate. 
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP. 
Thank you. 
That's my biggest challenge. 
Our invention had to address all of these issues. 
And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here, again, is to use, in addition to everything we talked about, this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread" because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making. 
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer. 
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. 
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands, on the fields of the poor people, and how to develop research technologies, which are based on the knowledge of the people. 
His name was Nikola, Nikola Tesla. 
Well, this isn't exactly true. 
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. 
Thank you very much. 
And my daily language is English. 
It's very harsh conditions. 
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century? 
He said two interesting things, "A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be." 
People, service, profit. 
Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson. 
Whatever. 
Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. 
I got about 3,000 emails. 
And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. 
I was that girl. 
(Laughter) I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying, "We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis." 
I just took their pictures and pasted them. 
Like those big explosions, sparks, are from a little comb jelly, and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans, and jellyfish. 
They were together while doing the tawaf, the circular walk around the Kaaba. 
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral, which is a critical habitat for the development of fish. 
And I thought about this concept of, imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor, modify and biologically enhance it, and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other? 
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. 
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone, only three options on the cellphone. 
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. 
They said, "Let's march." 
And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents, affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands. 
How can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap in the course of the years? 
So, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. 
(Applause) So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. 
(Laughter) The second question was an Icelandic word. 
He doesn't need salt and pepper. 
If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you? 
Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross-section, this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors, each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. 
It is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing. 
And if I can get the camera -- okay, great -- you'll see, as I get sort of close... 
And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. 
Electricity, you can't see that. 
Harvest contaminated tobacco. 
So there are two things going on. 
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey, they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. 
Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans, sometimes going through language barriers. 
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value; it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture. 
So I said to myself, "OK, great -- we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful." 
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. 
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. 
And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. 
I took more photos, and we started the project. 
And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. 
And the future self is not even around. 
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. 
And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. 
And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event; this happens across the developing world. 
The jumpmasters start to check the door. 
WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care, people care about this great transformation. 
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. It's very good. 
(Laughter) "That Saturday when you wondered where I was, well, I was getting your ring. 
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization. 
And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about. 
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new. 
As parents, you're always learning who your children are. 
You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person, that turns out to be 162 lifetimes spent every day, wasted, just getting from A to B. 
(Music) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake. 
He started MAPS for Kids, rebuilt the entire inner city school system, all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished. 
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise, and people create a space out of any found objects or materials. 
So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation? 
He gives half of them vitamin C. 
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls, and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern, and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls, which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. 
Well right now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical. 
There was silence for a while, then they said, "You've spelled it wrong. 
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. 
We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. 
We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically, we can do it in a 3D printer, we can do it in droplets for colleagues. 
It was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome. 
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful? 
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea. 
And I would only pay $99.50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it. 
Simple awareness is where it begins. 
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. 
So think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful. 
If it's that bad, we'll react. 
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised. 
Why are the eyes closed? 
At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years. 
When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. 
We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe, but we remain challenged. 
Well done, ladies and gentlemen. 
It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son. 
One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. 
A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. 
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough. 
has already set up a coalition to do this, an international coalition. 
And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message, whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention. 
The Highline is an old, elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan. 
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. 
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety. 
It takes us from Point A to chaos. 
(Applause) All right, so let's take four subjects that obviously go together: big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks. 
Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once. 
Module five: manual skills practice. 
But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting. 
Then everything becomes meaningful. 
Now this was in 1945. 
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. 
When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. 
You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half, and if you're in the right environment, they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts. 
We can do that. 
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification. 
It chose Somali piracy. 
And at 16, I stumbled across another opportunity, and I earned my first acting role in a film. 
(Applause) Our dream is very simple: to send each of these kids, get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully, contented in this conflict-ridden chaotic globalized world. 
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. 
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection, and how we're all totally interconnected here, and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe, we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past. 
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway, banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls, and he just took one hand off, reached back, flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit, and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall. 
And I had a revelation. I thought, "These guys took some creepy, run-down entertainment, and put it to the highest possible level of performance art." 
Well we're jazz musicians, so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid. 
It's three-quarters, roughly, which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear. 
So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good." 
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. 
Somehow, we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them -- the result is this. I mean, just look at it. 
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. 
So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations. 
It has a deep melancholy ring. 
You measure how the trees grow back, but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back. 
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. 
Thanks a lot. 
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region. 
And sometimes these are fun, right? 
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth, and much of it we don't know about. 
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum. 
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos, but anyway, they’re there in the garden. 
And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems? 
So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. 
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you, but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies, or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate. 
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. 
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax. 
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves, it becomes a movement. 
So, it's a very productive system. 
Think of the term we use, "Retreat." 
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me. 
(Laughter) This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits: eating enough fruits and vegetables, exercise three times a week, not smoking, and drinking in moderation. 
Life was good. 
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night, thinking, "Make it go away." 
But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat. 
You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box of who-knows-what. Do they have a point? 
He had some very complex models of how to survive. 
This is happening, however, against the background of the rise of Web logging. 
There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there, purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. 
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts. 
Host: And bless yourself. Thank you very much. 
I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. 
Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. 
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. 
Despite what had happened, I was sure we were going to live happily ever after, because I loved him, and he loved me so much. 
Each of these cultures take time to downshift. 
But I'm also sure, pretty sure, that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. 
Now for an intelligent being like our fly, this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. 
And in both cases, we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses, and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. 
What if you lose your iPhone? 
Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very, very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men. 
Keep your hands up if you did 10. 
That's what spreads HIV." 
And I would like to share with you a launch. 
My last word to you is a statement I believe in, which Egyptians have proven to be true, that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. 
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from. 
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. 
And notice, most of that went to the motherland, to the imperial metropoles, not to their colonial possessions. 
You cling to your land because it is your secure place. 
I ended up with blunt chest trauma. 
So what do you think happens to these gals? 
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness. 
The Okeanos Explorer on its mission. 
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. 
He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book. 
You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it. 
And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened. 
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. 
And I see my life as a series of experiments. 
Well statistically, the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated. 
And in these places they are cared for. 
(Laughter) I said, I know a coded message when I see one. 
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer, but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service. 
We spoke to you last several years ago. 
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. 
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow. 
I think I inherit it from my mother, who, used to crawl around the house on all fours. 
(Laughter) Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago. 
The lists go on and on. 
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. 
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day, and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers. 
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities, go out and design them. 
And so now it was time to do some research. 
And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone software development kit, and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. 
It's a spectacular achievement. 
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth." 
(Video) Guy: I might get one of those. 
(Laughter) If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool. 
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel. 
I launched a big program [unclear] CSIR about nine years ago. 
And in China, right now, they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. 
So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television. 
Walk the dog. Have sex again. 
These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state. 
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. 
Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation, but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery. 
Didn't get much sexier than the Spence at university, let me tell you. 
But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. 
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. 
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up? 
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time, and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people. 
One was growing out the front and it had already erupted, and it latched onto the bowel. 
Here is the same data on a map. 
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones, one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump, one of the lucky ones who survives. 
Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it? 
The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well. They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide. 
Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way. 
And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude, choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow, living with a sense of awareness of the world around you, embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself, being you and being cool with that, letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you, then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying, and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. 
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find." 
It's an issue for the women's movement. 
There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. 
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900, when the line switches to red. 
The message, then, for me, about unintended consequences is chaos happens; let's make better use of it. 
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. 
You see, that's the immune system. 
How do you know? 
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York, they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company. 
But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture -- you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground. 
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there. 
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. 
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up. 
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. 
Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent. 
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal." 
So, preaching for freedom of speech is easy here, but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division, again, what can a cartoonist do? 
And this is what we see when they use just the screen. 
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India. 
Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. 
So it's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste. 
So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope. 
I said, "No, I can't use my legs." 
But a lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great. 
I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine, to meet and, indeed, to mate. 
They changed signals, they changed lanes, everything they could do to make Times Square work better. 
We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2. 
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. 
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration," remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways, and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is. 
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah. 
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this, that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find -- we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that. 
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. 
And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates "us" and "them," "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil." 
He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off. 
She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town. 
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him. 
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say "thank you," and I go on to the next one. 
Fantastically useful plant, both for protein and for medicine. 
They don't really know what exponential means, but this is exponential. 
In other words, early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument, that's a fact. 
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees. 
You can see the orientation. The stem is down. 
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well, but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity. 
We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment. 
In a time where the world is becoming personalized, when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone, everything has its own personal identity, how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others? 
Well, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. 
And so we're on one planet, and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems. 
But because you don't have many other openings, the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong, active and even violent. 
This is violence. 
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality. 
So this meeting in Boston led to three things. 
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain? 
And the process still takes more than half a year. 
So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war -- which also, by the way, didn't work very well. 
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. 
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences, either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods, and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives. 
How is this story different? 
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries. 
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. 
Well, obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. 
This is a highly useless categorization scheme. 
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter) Anybody? Any guess at all? 
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax. 
And all because he decided to walk that day. 
So I'm just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this, and of course I've got a lot of other data, so if you're interested I'm happy to show more. So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment. 
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal. 
I mean KGB, and not just KGB, used to torture in order to actually get this data. 
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life. 
So this is where we need digital safety systems. 
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream. 
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars. 
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. 
You get a certificate and everything. 
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?" 
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition, but the problem is, we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives. 
And now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment. 
If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." 
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. 
70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of "We can." 
All of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved. 
They have all the solutions in the world. 
Thank you. 
And that is what has made it most fun. 
So I think the point -- the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. 
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening. 
(Laughter) (Translator) AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other. 
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch. 
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. 
After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ... 
The Internet has played a great role, helping these people to speak up their minds, to collaborate together, to start thinking together. 
In just five years, their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found. 
Child survival is the new green. 
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum. 
I start with my idea. I abstract it. 
Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear. 
And I always thought it was such a fantastic device. 
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. 
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. 
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s -- Europe did lots of development projects. 
But I also want to see shipping, and us, the general public, who know so little about it, to have a bit more scrutiny, to be a bit more transparent, to have 90 percent transparency. 
What kind of criteria did it use? 
Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us. 
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life. 
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn, I was trying to finish my first book, I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m. 
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. 
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems. 
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. 
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case? 
And every now and then, find a friend, find a turtle, and take a long, slow walk. 
It is where cell culture takes place. 
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse, with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? 
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. 
It's right off the library. And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school. 
But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body -- a further disassociation, like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. 
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet, innocent and beautiful fresh face. 
Here she is. 
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place." 
Because on Earth, almost all -- 99.9 percent -- of the methane is produced by living systems, not little green men, but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. 
So then we still had more tutors to use. 
But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. 
And here is the limitation: adult stem cells are mature cells, and, like mature human beings, these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types, as embryonic stem cells [can]. 
What about ultrasound? 
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. 
In any case, Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. 
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing. 
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking. 
Dance has never had a better friend than technology. 
You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases, patients who are saying, "You know what, I know what the odds are, but I'm going to go look for more information. 
And it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute. 
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend, stage was what I performed on, and grades were what I got in school. 
You're allowed to hate these people. 
then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. 
It was all due to this woman, Sister Mary Marastela, also known as my mom. 
We need culture out there." 
The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election, way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 -- (Laughter) the year Alberto Giacometti (Laughter) made "The Palace at Four in the Morning." 
Just for giving me his car keys, my own brother was detained twice, and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son. 
And I thought that was kind of cool. 
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story." 
You know, how can it work? 
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids. 
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. 
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought, but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. 
You can join the One Campaign, and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur. 
You either go up, or you come down." 
South Africans just make music really freely. 
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers, and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people, who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. 
Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character. 
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself, and the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible, the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there's an entire story here. 
It would have broken his heart. 
Okay. 
The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. 
So we were careful with that. 
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. 
There is a really enormous conflict, when we are talking about developing country cities, between pedestrians and cars. 
It happens when I dance, when I'm acting. 
Its liver expands by eight times. 
But it wasn't that simple. 
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory, are plants' futures. 
And then finally, electric vehicles. 
We have three main groups. 
Now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward, when the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle, clearly establishing that it's legal for them to test it on the roads in Nevada. 
(Laughter) "Come to visit the children? 
I had to think out of the box about some other model of care. 
The other variable that's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in. 
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test. 
You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. 
(Laughter) Not that you do; I'm just saying. 
When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles? 
And people still wonder why there are boys rotting, they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. 
But life begins, what does that mean? 
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu. 
It's our home. We welcome them. 
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on. 
So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. 
So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap, or company A versus company B, or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius, you know what, let it go. 
All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it. 
You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded. 
You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now. 
It's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the U.S. and the U.K. 
Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here. 
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make. 
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. 
We can get some things out on the Internet. 
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable. 
And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. 
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. 
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. 
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements? 
Right up to us, like right up to here. 
This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device -- among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit. 
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought, well I could give it to the neo-Nazis. 
And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? 
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold, we can steer insects to different directions. 
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. 
And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other, and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance. 
Plank number two: Empower your children. 
These are pictures over about a six-second period. 
That's the media environment we've got. 
How the molecules are put together. 
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry. 
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well -- very important bird nesting site, some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world. 
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. 
This was bad. 
They did it by remote control. 
I was born brown, I was born female, and I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us for reasons I can't control. 
Imagine what that means to our life support system. 
So we exchanged business cards, and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization, Friends of the High Line. 
You bring in a second group of people, and you say, "Oh, before we start, I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy. 
It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942. 
We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players. 
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. 
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company, a professional race car driver, and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway. 
And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, "We're going to be okay. 
(Laughter) If only. 
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. 
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. 
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars, turning them into acids. 
You have the USDA food pyramid. 
And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people. 
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert. 
Taking it a step further, MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans. 
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house. 
You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue. 
It's a problem across the developing world, and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica, for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament, you meet them, and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton, and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston, and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle-income country in the world: a dismal, depressing landscape of burnt and half-abandoned buildings. 
We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do, and this is really new for the humanities, which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. 
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine. 
And some say this was the start of a global movement. 
Well if that's true, Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle. 
The average American is nearly 20 times richer than the average Chinese by the 1970s. 
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage, and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives -- like deciding in advance what's going to happen, or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get. 
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future, when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up, say, 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year, not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe, thereby engaging lots of people, and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated. 
How do you cast mud? 
We're unhappy, we have bad education, and we have the worst businesses. 
How about artistic beauty? 
But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping iPods not bombs -- I mean, it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book. 
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health. 
Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding, we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. 
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. 
Often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they're batting around on their little devices. 
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. 
Now blink left to turn back left. 
Okay, so now, here's what we're going to do. 
In other words, they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order. 
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. 
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly. 
For years, I actually only wore hats. 
People were being beaten brutally. 
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end. 
How did he not know -- it's what we've all forgotten -- that we're not the first ones to build. 
And so this shows it's not 99 percent, but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff, so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated. 
Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives. 
So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good? 
And maybe that's true. 
We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. 
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down. 
They get their inspiration, their hope, their practical know-how, from successful emerging economies in the South. 
That is my invention. 
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. 
So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. 
And we could go back to those topics and say, well, what talks are central to those conversations? 
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself. 
(Applause) So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984. 
That's one city. 
(Applause) I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m. 
This lets you do it. 
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research? 
For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article. 
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece. 
The technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable. 
Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist. 
So we look at a process of group dynamics: coalescence and fragmentation, groups coming together, groups breaking apart. 
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days. 
The schools need you. The teachers need you. 
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras. 
A heroic effort is a collective effort, number one. 
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep." 
And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable. 
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing. 
But over four generations, he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu. 
Again, not an insane dose, not an illegal dose, but very much at the high end of normal. 
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. 
As a child, I had two passions. 
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas." 
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be. 
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17. 
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure, forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth, until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals, reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone. 
We're more appreciative, more open to reconciliation. 
The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses, and this is how we end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals. 
So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. 
So "Iron Man" zips right out, and "Waiting for Superman" can wait for a really long time. 
And so we get this starting material. 
And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. 
And over the next few decades, as the world's population expands to 10 billion, this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals. 
And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. 
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality. 
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second. 
And I'm so grateful they did. 
Nothing. They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. 
This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it. 
Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350. 
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them. 
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. 
You can run these off -- they're really hungry, they really like down-blended weapons pits, so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that's been down-blended. 
So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should pay attention to it. 
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony. 
He said, "One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation." 
They go out and test it against the evidence. 
Our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past. 
Now, a quick primer on DNA. 
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. 
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time. 
But will this only be available for the super rich, for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics? 
But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. 
You know if you look at the development in the West over 200 years, the average growth may have been about two percent. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted? 
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds. 
Thank you very much. 
What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0. 
So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. 
He did. He served out his sentence. 
This is what we are using." 
But he also deeply believed, he truly believed, that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it. 
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not. 
For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare. 
Three days later, after everybody has left the home, my mom went and brought a nurse. 
♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Have the years been kind? ♫ ♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫ ♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫ ♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫ ♫ We won't say a word ♫ ♫ We won't need them ♫ ♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫ ♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫ ♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ 
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries. 
He even photographed the bones of the human body. 
We live where we want to be -- at least in the West. 
(Laughter) Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation. 
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head, they try to communicate those over the web. 
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. 
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. 
So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. 
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, "Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well." 
(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.) MS: It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart. 
As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space. 
We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. 
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, "We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. 
It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper, and I can feel them with my fingers. 
February. 
But even more importantly, he created a language, a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows. 
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness, decided that they were going to let it go, that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly. 
Varuna has but a thousand eyes. 
And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know, sort of going from bad to worse, and we said the related search was, "Retards." 
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it. 
Shall we try that one again? 
And then there's security. 
And, you know, it's interesting, there's some research that talks about why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox. 
So what we need to know to even address this mystery is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain, and, number two, how selves are constructed. 
Well, it's not the war on terror. 
But it's a very important role. 
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period, effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread. 
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants. 
"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object, but not our life?" 
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level, rather than merely on a political level, a level above politics -- movements that are not political parties, but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture. 
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. 
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine. 
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal. 
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. 
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. 
So some things that are missing is, for example, if you had a flow of energy through a system, what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself, much like living systems do. 
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want. 
There are more pictures. There are more photographers. 
Because you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you, but we are all part of this system and we can all be part of that solution. 
Barack Obama said in a speech, that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. 
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them. 
(Laughter) So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work? 
(Applause) Now, extinction is a different kind of death. 
Well, if you teach, if you worship in the temple of learning, do not mock the gods, because they will take you, fill you with curiosity and desire, and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. 
even when it's so hard. 
With the same method, we can also get him to circle a person. 
This is the picture. 
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. 
There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. 
And I'll tell you why. 
Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1:12. 
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet. 
Maybe you thought that was scary, but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. 
You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. 
And feet in the water will develop fungus, infections, and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point. 
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience? 
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity? 
So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota, and that's a very difficult one for me. 
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you. 
Yes. 
So there's really only one area where we're near the top, and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. 
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. 
Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology, so steam and things. 
It's really horrible. 
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls. 
(Applause) A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia. 
And that's something from my father and something from other capable, generous men that have been in my life. 
But then something even more interesting happens. 
(Laughter) How many of you have been to Oklahoma City? 
No matter whether we as designers intend it or not, we materialize morality. 
Well, a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. 
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down. 
What crystals are possible, we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry. 
"Know thyself." 
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them. 
And I put strategy at the top of it. 
They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. 
I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion. 
In our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy. 
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle, the area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight, and the base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right? 
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns? 
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you; I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions. 
So what do we find? 
It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. 
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. 
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. 
And evolution, although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people, evolution still is a little bit intangible. 
What about the Indus script? 
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece? 
So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives. 
Mother nature wastes very little, reuses practically everything. 
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea. 
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called "the cylinder." 
If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation. 
We sent it over to Uganda. 
So I'm not saying, "Be like us," and "We're perfect role models," because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. 
They aren't supposed to be out at large." 
These are different wars, with different religious factions, different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems. 
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. 
There is the law in Leviticus, "You cannot shave the corners of your beard." 
And in fact, we know that that's true, because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study, and when they submitted it to the exact same journal, the journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing replication. We're not interested in your negative data." 
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone. 
Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did. 
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. 
Whereas the personal income, on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation, has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period. 
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different than the conditions of the air in this room. 
And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue. 
I could see vividly, I suppose, being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background, and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind. 
All ideas on board were welcome. 
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it. 
I accept where we are. 
We've cast the second and the third mirrors. 
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid. 
So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem. 
And I'm already off-message. 
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south, that much I knew, but I was surprised to learn this little fact: Those are not cartographers' lines, like latitude or the borders between nations, they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt, and they change. 
Would you eat this? 
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. 
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. 
(Applause) I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history in 18 minutes. 
But also back then, remember we stopped eating French fries in this country. 
It's exactly the same behavior though. 
Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place. 
(Applause) Now that would never happen. 
I work at the Cambridge Hospital. 
And then those spat are then seeded. 
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo, Crosby. 
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow. 
And during a lot of this work, we found something, or I found something, that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it. 
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now? 
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect. 
But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill. 
That doesn't interest me. 
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. 
Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room, the general atmosphere. 
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching. 
Like TED, I believe in people. 
This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does -- as an investment. 
That is, military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil, which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security. 
The voice is the instrument we all play, and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained; learn to sing, learn to play an instrument. 
But it's actually not, because there's an example by statistics professor, Hans Rosling. 
Ask me. 
I gave you three simple answers to three questions: Give lentils to immunize people, provide free bed nets, deworm children. 
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. 
As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything. 
And, working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer, I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that, inside this object, which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials. 
NA: As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women. 
There was one held in Detroit here last summer, and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford. 
And National Geographic got interested because National Geographic has the theory that the last century, discovery was basically finding things, and in this century, discovery is basically making things. 
So we actually have some movement forward. 
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly. 
Valence means good or bad, positive or negative. 
We're ready to go. 
And you know what? 
Adventists are conservative Methodists. 
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter) And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was. 
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. 
The antibodies you just saw in this video, in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work. 
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?" 
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. 
Look at this. 
The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. 
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side, but in terms of the system itself? 
That's what happened with my dad. 
And I noticed this in a very funny way. 
And it really struck me as the years went by, in a very negative way, when I would go to some stream that I'd loved, and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies, and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it. 
Would it surprise you? 
(Music) (Singing) Go! 
Video: Throughout human history people have played games. 
And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. 
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses, health administration and community health workers throughout the country, to set up the information technology, the solar energy, the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure. 
What is the origin of the data? 
So then, what do we do about that? 
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology, as in this example outside of Minneapolis. 
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century. 
It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. 
It's pretty cool, at least in theory. 
(Laughter) So they could do that on their own. 
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. 
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica. 
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. 
Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. 
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea. 
For wind, there's a larger area, but much smaller footprint. 
Over here, these are the Apsaras. 
That's just a working title, by the way. 
It's our faith, and we will be loyal to it. 
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. 
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need. 
And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories. 
On the other hand was my grandmother, who also took care of me and was more spiritual, less educated and definitely less rational. 
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush. 
We're talking about popular TV. 
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used. 
But this is our front porch. We live there. 
The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. 
You're in your office, and you're drinking your bottled water, or whatever it is, and you think to yourself, "Hey, I'm going to throw this away. 
They are often ignored because they're harder to help. 
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am. 
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine. 
But these things are everywhere. 
So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals. 
He heard a very different story. 
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry, and from there to rationing of food and energy. 
And what explains the fact that that's what you think? 
Now obviously, those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring. 
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me. 
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report, and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy -- 1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea. 
Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. 
But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. 
Last year, it was 1,000. 
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married, she brought a handbag along as a wedding present. 
But we are learning more and more about the human brain. 
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited. 
They communicate, of course, but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants, or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. 
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors." 
He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin, and the other bees are attracted to it. 
They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties, like illegal dumping, and they know that because the city has lost so much population, their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising, because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. 
Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here. 
That's not that hard. 
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President. 
The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action. 
We were up in the mountains, and Feynman said to me, he said, "Leonardo." 
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman. 
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'? 
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. 
(Laughter) The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating. 
And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course -- it's available now, online, free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions, at universities in China, in India, in Africa, around the world, to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate. 
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was, "How could I have done that? 
And that communication, that connectivity around the world, that globalization now raises a burden. 
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?" 
I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. 
Some of it's transportation access. 
It could be anti-corrosion. 
June 17 comes. 
There are many people on this stage right now. 
(Applause) Charitable status: Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. 
(Applause) And then I thought, "Why stop there? 
First thing for my wife, and the most common thing I hear from my patients, particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group, is they come in and say, "Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee? 
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- 35 Gs. 
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table. 
Don't forget to subtract the one. 
Not likely. 
I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. 
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there with me, were Moonies. 
What did they spend it on? 
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say. 
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life. 
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. 
These are some of the images of the coup. 
The other was Microsoft. 
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files, armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. 
It's like resetting a thermostat. 
I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic. 
(Applause) Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. 
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry." 
Imagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying. 
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. 
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next? 
There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean, which collected more garbage than they did animals. 
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. 
What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save. 
(Laughter) Nope. 
So it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals. 
You'll see that start right here. 
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website, had 35,000 comments on this issue within hours. 
The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. 
We could probably hear it, if we tune in." 
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. 
A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services. 
This is playing with those filters. 
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. 
You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery: how nature, seemingly so effortlessly, manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex. 
And you're like, "Actually, shut up! 
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down. 
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. 
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired." 
Huh, amazing. 
Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help, think about this. 
On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can. 
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. 
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. 
And as you can imagine, I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity. 
(Laughter) But that's not the way most scientists think. 
What about the probability of being caught? 
I'm not going to make a claim about who's right, but I will make an empirical claim about people's intuitions, which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock, you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create, that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy. 
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History, Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions, like here in the Gobi Desert. 
She was not the top student when we took her. 
Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness. 
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy. 
This is Joe Kittenger himself. 
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites -- and almost anything you pick up is like that. 
(Laughter) And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. 
We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage, but beaches are closed a lot in our country. 
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that. 
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small. 
If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech. 
(Music) Voice: System ready. Acquiring image. 
When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. 
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic. 
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. 
So I feel connected to each language in a different way. 
And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas. 
And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition." 
But it's self-evident assessment. 
Most of them have fairly good education. 
(Applause) Climate change is already a heavy topic, and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are. 
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive. 
It was a way of keeping my head attached. 
We've learned over time that stars have individual histories; that is, they have birth, they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. 
It's completely mechanical, again, a printer. 
And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. 
Now, science and asking questions is about courage. 
I am a gay talking head on Fox News. 
The thing that was bad about colonialism, and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs, is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension. 
But what we're going to focus on is this red region -- I've labeled it red here -- and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. 
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
And once the conditions are present, what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. 
It's super-real and it's happening around you. 
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version, we just can't make that happen, and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. 
The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before. 
Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. 
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now? 
The rest of my family are boring academics, busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. 
OK, so it's called linked data. 
And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ... 
In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. 
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand. 
I slowed it down for you. 
Please download your copy, and thank you very much. 
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. 
So I created this, the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO. 
It foamed, and horrible things were happening to me. 
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within. 
I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities. 
If I was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one's perception to it, and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it, but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point? 
It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems -- the devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War; the fragile peace that had been brought about; the need for a whole economic regeneration. 
It's scaffolding and plywood. 
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. 
And our Founding Fathers knew about this. 
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability. 
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya. 
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions, having to do with monkeys and apples. 
And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation. 
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid, is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens. 
And this forest is quite different. 
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation." 
She had to impersonate a man. 
Now you might say, well, this is just natural. 
Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx. 
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. 
And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing. 
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese, there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. 
And every woman in the room here has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative. 
But they won't come to us directly through light. 
They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious, but my children were hungry. 
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And then on May 5th, 1945, the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. 
Thank you. 
But reaching 500 million people is much, much tougher. 
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora, the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. 
It's all about partnerships. 
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring, and their offspring don't survive. 
That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts. 
And so all our schools are English medium schools. 
Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us, and it comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. 
It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter. 
We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda. 
And being alone is very unnatural to the human. 
The red dots are going to be cases of the flu, and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. 
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker's just one kind of mind. 
That's what people did then, speaking like writing. 
I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan, who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct, and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church, one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed. 
This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. 
We walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan. 
In about the length of this session, you would have counted all 5,000. 
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. 
So this raises three really important questions: What is life? 
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there, for whom nightfall means darkness, to have a new means of operating. 
(Laughter) Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. 
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda, that's something that comes to your mind immediately. 
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? 
For two weeks, she became my companion, slept with me. 
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. 
Easy when you know how. 
And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports, the 10,000-page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information, they were told they weren't allowed to have them. 
Peter Singer: There were other people who walked past Wang Yue, and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm. 
This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy. 
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet. 
He had developed this way, this kind of methodology, that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time. 
(Laughter) And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. 
This is an unbelievable light show. 
So what's going on? 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. 
There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. 
Together with the architects of Albert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineers from Transsolar have been supporting, have been developing open-air stadia based on 100 percent solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling. 
He has a book, "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age," and the Liberal Age, he defines as 19th century and early 20th century. 
(Laughter) Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. 
The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from "ah" to "ee." 
He loved intellectual battle. 
(Applause) Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin? 
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature. 
Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. 
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice. 
If you'll recall, prior to that time, no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you, bleeding you, purging you. 
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical. 
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy. 
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing. 
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house. 
(Applause) Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna, especially birds, and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month, and transported far from their origins, to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 
I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly. 
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. 
I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. 
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. 
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. 
So, I wasted some time there. 
What are the kind of jobs that we have today? 
This coral is eight meters tall, right. 
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods. 
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities I've developed a device that, on a very small scale, can produce these isotopes. 
In my part of the world, too many people live below the poverty line. 
So now we had a hangar space to work in, and prototypes to demo with. 
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits, but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. 
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. 
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed -- that's three thousand millionth seed -- is now stored. 
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there. 
Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy. 
I'm going to give a fast example here. 
The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells, but we don't know why. 
So what do you do with a dead mall, dead office park? 
This is an idea worth spreading. 
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?" 
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. 
(Music) Lyn: When I'm making music, I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane. 
(Applause) He's actually here today. 
I watch what people do. 
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice. 
Nobody knew it was an actor. 
So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living. 
Well, why is all of this so important? 
In June, the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years. 
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?" 
Urban retrofitting: creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there. 
My father, a secret agent? 
Here's our winner of the soprano solo. 
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. 
(Applause) After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial, the spokesperson of the traffic police said, we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers. 
This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes. 
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief. 
With institutions established to think about the future, the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming. 
She ended up underneath the car. 
Well, the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body, my body, your body, is about 90 years, a little bit more for women. 
These three people in the village sat down and decided to think, "How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?" 
And we manipulated how much money we gave them. 
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that. 
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. 
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think, each of us seems to think, "I am an expert. 
That day, I learned what fear was. 
So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer. 
And as we've learned over the centuries, since Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist, first turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky, every time we have built larger telescopes, we have learned something about the universe; we've made discoveries, without exception. 
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find? 
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts, but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads. 
And then just leave it all to them. 
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. 
And then I tasted it, and it, you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness, which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways. 
Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically, we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. 
And at the very beginning, not too many people are affected, and you get this classic sigmoidal, or S-shaped, curve. 
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. 
And everywhere I go, including here at TED, I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing. 
One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade, some new brackets for the box. 
So stay tuned for further information. 
And who's responsible? Designers. 
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you. 
(Applause) EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. 
And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing. 
That is civilization -- and in its soil grow continually freedom, comfort and culture," what all TEDsters care about most. 
If you listen to the way black youth today speak, think about the use of the word "yo." 
This is between 50 and 100 megawatts. 
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ... 
And, of course, graphics: Today 84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago. 
There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. 
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide. 
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. 
The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body weight, there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight, more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it, and the system works like a thermostat, responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism, to keep your weight stable as conditions change. 
That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light, it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions. 
We are in danger, all of us, and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response, to help us bravely face a threat. 
All of these girls went to the gold mine, and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things. 
So how does it work? 
So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you, but I want to show you two short clips. 
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. 
To give you a sense of how small that size is, that's the size of our solar system. 
And the one I'm working on right now, which is -- because I'm right in the middle of it, and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers. 
And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness. 
And the [horizontal] axis is time. 
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale. 
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great, big battleground on this earth. 
What's the syllabus? 
Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people. 
So from day one, the people involved in the project, bottom left is Fabian Nicieza, writer for X-Men and Power Rangers. 
They take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more -- take a little bit of the increase and put it in a 401(k) plan. 
In New York, this is where it's distributed from: the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street. 
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest, more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary. 
Where would that leave us? 
It's flipping freezing in that water. 
In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi, I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. 
There's a vetted press release that you can read -- it's vetted by DOD -- if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox." 
I mean, you've never seen anything like this. 
Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye, and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. 
You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular. 
And only now," he says, "I'm beginning to understand where I am, and I actually like it." 
Well in Egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. 
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright, the act is essentially unchanged. 
Now how is that possible? 
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat, and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice, but it's being lost. 
When Ram dies, Krishna is born. 
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different. 
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape, and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action. 
So anyway, let's go with the red pill. 
But we would also like to understand it. 
The result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections, and when I went out and said, "What is wrong with the interim provincial council? 
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. 
She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. 
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I'm optimistic about it. 
In the last year? 
What makes us who we are anyway? 
This piece, actually, will be on display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show. 
It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women. 
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl, that number seems awfully low. 
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet. 
And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave. 
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through. 
And some doctors think, "Yeah right, you're really in pain." 
In fact, the West has lost its work ethic. 
Video: (Music) DM: I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. 
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. 
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school, and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks, and I decided to go traveling. 
The height of the bars is the risk of death, and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had. 
But there was something else that I've noticed as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy. 
We can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans. 
And I started across the hall in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto, and would have all that in detail. 
And so I've always been fascinated by free-style. 
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing -- thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question. 
This is all seven Harry Potter novels, because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end. 
What I can do and what I would like to do with you is give you, like that initial question, a set of questions to figure out for yourself, layer by layer, like peeling an onion, getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion. 
So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. 
MBI generates four images per breast. 
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you." 
We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio. 
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment. 
(Laughter) But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building, I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV, going, "Please, don't be Middle Eastern. 
Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up. 
Her answer was quite the contrary. 
(Applause) You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact. 
(Applause) You've all seen lots of articles on climate change, and here's yet another New York Times article, just like every other darn one you've seen. 
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs. 
"Come on. This is our opportunity." 
We can see the calcium from the world's deserts, soot from distant wildfires, methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon, all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. 
I live in society; I live in community. 
Feasting? I was totally confused. 
That's 58 billion dollars. 
And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling. 
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things; they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart. 
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil -- contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown. 
I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. 
One of them is Yao Chen, she is the most popular microblogger in China, who has about 21 million followers.

Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs: How do we keep fish on our menus? 
I'm totally clueless. 
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed. 
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. 
And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light. 
How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space? 
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare, and this is going to be a challenge, because, if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times, nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. 
And that bias is that we're asking, is this or that "still" ethical? 
Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium, there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs. 
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention, which kids were bored, and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board. 
So if you don't have money to offer to people, you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of. 
Thank you. 
Losing of labels, because we are not jam jars. 
One thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers. 
This cancer is remarkable. 
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision. 
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this. 
So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school, about that big, they played the same trick on us? 
Thank you. 
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right? 
We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. 
So I'm going to move on. 
You get this really huge power out of it. 
So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules would spread in the air, and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance. 
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world. 
It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion, but that's not detailed enough. 
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance, afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating, and that seems to be about as much as they can do. 
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work. 
This next video clip, you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. 
That's called the photophoretic force. 
(Applause) Play video one. 
Even if it takes me four and a half hours, or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it. 
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray. 
But that's not the only way you can rig your data. 
So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane. 
And here you can see this parasite in action, like in an acrobatic maneuver. 
It never has been and it never will be. 
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. 
Somi. 
We all know right and wrong, right? 
I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives. 
There's just no way of getting it right. 
The solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him, is to convert you all to Christianity -- just get rid of your religion. 
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine." 
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed. 
I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. 
Play: our brains are hardwired for play. 
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs." 
(Laughter) Age as pathology. 
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again. 
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess, who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with? 
She worked as a manager for Goodwill. 
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making. 
So spinning forward, one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart, and he was a U.S. Air Force officer. 
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of "otherizing" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. 
It was an offering, an invitation. 
Let's talk about past and future billions. 
It's about energy emissions. 
And worse than that, far worse than that, my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating. 
Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn. 
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, China's dominant search engine, was one of the recipients. 
Incidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was. 
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today, of migration, will be turned on their head, as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future. 
(Applause) What do you do when you have a headache? 
Just like those effective door hangers, we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors, and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save. 
Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... 
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening, which is as important as external globalization. 
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars. 
Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes, or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model, and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see. 
More specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. 
My wife sent me a message, "Whoa, earthquake," and then disappeared for 25 minutes. 
But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. 
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this, with measuring. 
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in. 
There's stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it's the only place they still occur today. 
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey. 
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus. 
How about bed nets? 
And the thing that's most exciting about that is every time I think about research, there are more questions. 
If the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization. 
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. 
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it. 
Turns out it really means, "We want nothing to do with your movie." 
In here you see a traditional 2D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation, and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs. 
And so the Red List is really important, keep track of what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on. 
You're all part of the artwork too. 
So I wanted to follow those. 
(Laughter) No way. 
And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, where does 404 come from? 
He's invented more than 200 games to teach virtually any subject under the sun. 
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion. 
Thank you. 
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst, and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance, on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. 
They may well be by a TED speaker, and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey. 
So, I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. 
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit. 
(Applause) (Mechanical noises) (Music) (Applause) My name is Ryan Lobo, and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years. 
They're just chopped at different heights. 
You put down your arrowheads and say, "I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50." 
That's all we're doing here. 
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining. 
If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red. 
I was an unlikely person to be doing this. 
I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? 
(Applause) In October 2010, the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99. 
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. 
So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16. 
But then I said, I want to go out with this information. 
This landscape shows up today on calendars, on postcards, in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. 
When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera. 
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. 
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. 
It's at CDC.gov. 
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. 
Where does medical ability end and start? 
It comes out of the ground like a train. 
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first client, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth, to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" 
What's the evidence of wiping out? 
It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator. 
The most extreme example of this is that in some cases, pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure. 
But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big. 
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. 
And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today. 
So this is some work that we're doing. 
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. 
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table. 
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. 
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen. 
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. 
Statistically speaking, there is no difference in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other. 
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument? 
How was I supposed to live it? 
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes, which makes you a breadth-first problem solver: you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking. 
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent. 
When we compare those hundred years of video, we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. 
So what I often like to say is that, from a genomic perspective, we are all Africans. 
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. 
These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. 
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei. 
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. 
How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves, when they could be feeding the world? 
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. 
They just gained a new confidence. 
We tested a lot of specimens there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that." 
Thank you. 
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. 
I'm in this for the long run, and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me. 
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful? 
This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why. 
Thank you very much. 
It's pretty straightforward. 
We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. 
Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child. 
You glaze over with it. 
Education is so essential. 
And here's the really alarming part: we don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries. 
Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. 
39 percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. 
They divide them farther. 
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is. 
Because as that happens, I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open, more just and more creative, to engage with each other and to help each other. 
It was a historical day. 
The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly, but profitable. 
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed. 
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase -- the upward ascension of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity. 
We need to act like we only have one planet. 
(Applause) A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen, so there's a sixth volume that has washable, waterproof paper. 
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had, and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. 
They include exploration, which is about going for quantity; building, and thinking with your hands; and role-play, where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing, and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic. 
This is the core mystical moment of Islam, and as such, of course, it defies empirical analysis. 
Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them. 
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff, but what she was saying, as you could make out, was about neurons, with her hands were like that, and she was saying neurons communicate. 
I thought to myself, why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. 
One day, I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. 
So that's one more element for this continuity. 
I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan. 
But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. 
Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. 
Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories. 
And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated. 
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them. 
That's all true. 
That's the difference. 
"Today I walk. Yesterday I walked." 
The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park. 
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. 
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days. 
The last image we don't have. 
Johnny call, you go. 
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. 
(Laughter) Woman: Superior technology. 
And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control. 
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently, but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right? 
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. 
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is, but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it, and it maps it and it makes it public. 
A woman came from Africa with music. 
2.6 billion people cook on open fires -- on coal, wood and animal dung. 
And this is an opening phrase from the novel "Lolita." 
That gave an advantage; that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. 
So for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free. 
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. 
Now look at this. 
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. 
They take it for a little while, but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down, and they discover they're enslaved. 
Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. 
They're more accepting of sadness than younger people are. 
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. 
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah. 
No, no, that's the only place a ship's been. 
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet. 
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. 
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details. 
Thank you very much. 
So it continued on for many years after he died. 
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. 
Stayed with them, followed up on them, made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump. 
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. 
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last. 
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley. 
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on. 
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die. 
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man, but this was back in 1972, when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away. 
Women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns. 
Now, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact, this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. 
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?" 
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. 
Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose. 
It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. 
There's a whole range of innovations that we have. 
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters. 
But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria. 
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. 
Alternatively, I could say, "Yesterday, I thrived." 
But it was not without misadventure. 
But I also realized that there is one thing that I could give you. 
At that age, I also learned about what an animator was. 
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing. 
It had nothing to do with hating my body, I just love it enough to let it go, I treat it like a house, and when your house is falling apart, you do not evacuate, you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides, you make it pretty enough to invite guests over, you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. 
The housing office is unable to build new structures, and existing structures are falling apart. 
You just -- oh, man. 
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar. 
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. 
And then, when she closed the door, Grandma said, "No, no, no, no. 
Actually, it's a really big idea. 
If we can get enough of these streams of information together, we can perhaps start to understand the war. 
Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen: Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please. 
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror looking into the room where the snake was, and he'd get them comfortable with that. 
These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much. 
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game. 
This happens one day: I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology: viruses and how they attack. 
This is priceless. 
In fact, we don't even know what any of these objects say, and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered. 
That means it doesn't mix with the water. 
We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in the Women's Heart Center. 
So we can relax the criterion a bit and say: How many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in Africa have one variant, 95 percent another variant, and the number of that is 12. 
Liberia is now home to an all-woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers. 
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all. 
And it is within that culture that we really can get -- and this is the novelty -- something that is not entirely set by our biology. 
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. 
There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. 
Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks, and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space, like on the walls of a gallery or a museum, this was work that was really in dialogue with this place, and in a lot of ways, The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. 
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large. 
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death. 
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world. 
He has a purpose in life. 
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left, 23 came back, two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground. 
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile. 
(Laughter) We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came. 
The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. 
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet, and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change. 
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. 
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. 
And we're not exactly sure why that happens. 
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. 
We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. 
The same applies to educators. 
This looks like a giant hamburger. 
And this something that's often brought up. 
So India is reverting to the normal. 
But life expectancy in this country is only 78. 
There are also jets emanating out from the center. 
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers. 
(Applause) So arguing against, a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. 
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. 
What's the right thing to do? 
Okay, step back a minute. 
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations. 
This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich. 
And we are educating our kids, having fewer kids, basically good news all around. 
I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. 
Many found work in the automobile industry, the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. 
I saw this leaflet and it said, "There are millions of slaves in the world today." 
And this holds for germs, ideas, product adoption, behaviors, and the like. 
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for Save the Children, ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit. 
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. 
But he didn't have Wikipedia. 
And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. 
And we said, "That's incredible!" 
SS: I normally talk about language. 
Our artists are at risk. 
And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted, but that exists no more. 
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese, and his flock continues. 
This is Jean Vanier. 
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. 
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry. 
If people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel there are unsure whether this person's hostile or not. 
Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. 
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun. 
And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. 
Every trip to the store, or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. 
Because, when I told her I was going out to play with the kids, I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell. 
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. 
I am sure, I am optimistic, that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams. 
And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process. 
She stands with 10,000 arms, and in every hand, there is an instrument of liberation, and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes, and these are the eyes of wisdom. 
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. 
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. 
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem, but it can address the problem. 
But you get these resources together. 
But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered, is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. 
But how wrong it is. 
Here's a short glimpse from those years. 
And perception underpins everything we think, we know, we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear, falling in love, everything begins with perception. 
Here in Britain, I put out a call for British grandmothers, after my Kuppam experiment. 
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade, and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe, we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year, half of which would accrue to the Third World. 
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by 2030. 
Think about your own choices. 
And the beautiful thing was, I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline. 
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle, and pass these cars, then that's not very nice. 
So eight of us went in: four men and four women. 
The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. 
And she realizes, you know, we don't have enough food, and so she asks what to do, and I say, "Well, we can either" -- Remember, she's seven -- "We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side." 
There's been four billion years of organic, biological life. 
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world." 
They moved to an abandoned school. 
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life. 
That the crazy idea is just that, it is crazy, and with the Earth full, it's game over. 
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from? 
And I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchanging one thing for another. 
It looks nasty, like in college when you didn't like statistics. 
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. 
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me. 
It's sensitive to place and to scale. 
Now, the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful. 
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain. 
Is it fun? Is it playful? 
This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village, set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan [was] by the three women. 
150 people lived there, worked there. 
BG: And there is this impression that North America and Europe are not really paying attention to these trends. 
This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions. 
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. 
So if you look at the green data points, which is air that's outside, you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity, or variety of microbial types. 
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it? 
That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to. 
But before you give yourself too much credit, look at this. 
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus. 
And you shred the candidate list. 
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. 
What are you going to contribute? 
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. 
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2, and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally? 
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology, biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species, to bring the current total to 5,400, and more continue to pour in. 
We need to take advantage of that. 
You know, people say how half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed. 
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it was one word: electronics. 
(Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. 
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities. 
(Laughter) The United States has been an idea leader. 
(Applause) We are losing our listening. 
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common. 
It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars. 
This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy. 
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles. 
That means that pigs also share diseases with us. 
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. 
I heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers, the majority of whom were black, but there were a handful of white performers. 
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls. 
Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance. 
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. 
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. 
Now this looks already quite interesting, but let me now add some watercolors to it. 
Very simple. 
And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background, this wild music. 
(Applause) I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. 
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has? 
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. 
Well, so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out who changed, and where did they go? 
What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love, care, and unreserved passion. 
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark? 
And eventually, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself. 
And let me immediately tell you here, when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita," good life, human life. 
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes, large unblinking eyes, sometimes made of silver, so they look at you. 
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air, a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide -- all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. 
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. 
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness," because it works for us each time. 
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in, the most common symptoms associated with those diseases, diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke. 
It includes things like the Internet cables. 
So, she is pretty significant in size. 
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism, but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century. 
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. 
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. 
So there he is there. 
And the third one is: Do free bed nets discourage future purchase? 
And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow, if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 
And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam. 
Computers made things move, but these were all real, folded objects that we made. 
Very inspiring. 
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. 
We adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there. 
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together. 
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. 
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means, that might surprise them to hear, because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong, when you break up with your girlfriend, when you lose a loved one, when you don't get the job you wanted. 
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. 
The future is inherently uncertain. 
For example, I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. 
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable. 
You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it, so they fly into the windows and get killed. 
What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves, and that's why it's so valuable. 
And so guess what, scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. 
Thank you very much. 
Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad. 
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently." 
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS. 
To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle. 
I started in 2005 studying honeybees. 
This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. 
And you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life -- and I know this is true of some of you -- if you were drinking all day, and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life, you would have better ideas. 
It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes, which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space. 
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either. 
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. 
70 percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map; 60 percent couldn't find India; 30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean. 
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy. 
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away." 
It's like, what is simplicity? 
I control the brain in order to understand how it works. 
But when this happened, I saw the whole planet. 
And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair, or going down to Arizona to play golf. 
You don't plan the details, and people will figure out what to do, how to adapt to this new framework. 
Data is relationships. 
When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see. 
[But now] he was ready to tell. 
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job, and then she almost ran away screaming. 
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city. 
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies, trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. 
When are they going to come by and explain things to me? 
Please understand the problem of poor people. 
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour. 
Those tamper-proof caps, that came from this. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You guys are looking good out there. 
We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code. 
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs. 
We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. 
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat. 
You can be yourself and have your face. 
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine, and I admit it to them openly. 
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected. 
Mid-sized company in the Midwest, blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away. 
Tell me. What should I do to save energy?" 
In fact, this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings. 
We tell another story. 
And then your cousin says, "Hey cuz, check out this website. 
Remember Prickly Pear. 
So imagine white guys pasting white papers. 
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?" 
Instead, the context, the common ground activities, are the content on television that's driving the conversations. 
They are performing puja. 
I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. 
And worst of all, we will never know. 
When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive. 
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition, where you're talking about one thing instead of the other. 
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel. 
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force. 
And when I arrived in Singapore, and I apologize for this, but I didn't want to get off my ship. 
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles. 
In fact, it's more like five percent. 
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
And my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us. 
Another child within weeks of Tasering the six year-old boy. 
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood, and they have "story algorithms" -- a company called Epagogix. 
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. 
These women have toxic breast milk. 
And so, I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia. 
Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. 
For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it's not "scientific." 
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double, for instance, in the first year. 
On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the United States. 
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. 
And then also we had the human habitat of course, with the laboratories, and all of that. 
That's where we are today. 
If we reach that stage, then there's something else: we can extract from this document events. 
Since then, no one has ever skied -- this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. 
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement, I got to really understand what they're doing. 
Okay, we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to live in a world with slavery? 
We need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits. 
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way, get our egotism out of the way. 
It's time for you to get in the water." 
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe. 
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use. 
In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory, because it's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of God. 
I wish for a better life. 
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption, but they still use millions of gallons of water. 
Let's also think about how we manage risks -- for example, investing in the stock market. 
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking. 
It's not something we can turn off. 
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. 
They are delicacies. 
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina, many women started to tell me about theirs -- their stories about their bodies. 
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. 
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says, we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group. 
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back. 
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. 
That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. 
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- I failed, I failed, I failed. 
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan than it is to give a 500 dollar loan. 
(Laughter) But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career -- it brought me a lot of success. 
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar, and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people. 
We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout, and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?" 
Audience: The cart's not part of the game. 
So the first thing I'd like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right. 
So I had an idea. 
We buy it for our kids. 
So let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit. 
And you see agenda -- this is marketing, this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another, trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings, marginalizing people with models you don't like. 
And yet, for the most part, our culture has not come to terms with what this means. 
Ideas are opportunities and innovation. 
This is a disaster. 
Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes. 
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus. 
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary. 
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development. 
We know because it says so inside the code. 
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them. 
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus. 
One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't. 
I think it does. 
And to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy. 
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s: there were about 80,000 slaves transported from Africa to the New World. 
First you need access to land. 
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign. 
We call this crustal magnetism. 
Infection in India. 
So this is the leading killer of women. 
Why was everyone surprised at this? 
Summize built a Twitter search engine. 
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? 
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. 
So what's my wish? 
About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit: it becomes elliptical instead of circular. 
When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance. 
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. 
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project. 
I was exposed to him. 
Everything gives out some kind of data, whether it's sound or smell or vibration. 
Now I'm not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, "I rest my case." 
That's not only to censor you. 
So this is one of the books that they do. 
Every other animal is stronger than we are -- they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed. 
They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient. 
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly. 
So, the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology. 
So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story, how I was born for it, how I learned along the way this subject matter? 
So, in fact, my graduate students are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope, in Hawaii, making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage, where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars, and so few old stars. 
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. 
And back to the yew here. 
Why is this old table in your office?" 
We're bending the curve. 
There's something that I'd like you to see. 
And you see here a picture of a tissue section. 
You can zoom around very simply. 
The world is, in fact, getting more global. 
And of course, our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here. 
They are dying of sadness." 
That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. 
Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire, you can have that kind of impact. 
Thank you. 
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow. 
(Laughter) But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. 
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. 
Their eyes literally light up, and they say things like, "I want one of those," or, "If you can do that, I can do anything." 
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable; on the other hand we have the unimaginable. 
If you take too much out of something that's simple, you lose function. 
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. 
As you see here, we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal. 
The second one is, how do you go to the loo at minus 40? 
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. 
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it. 
But that's the lectures. 
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky. 
I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids, did electronics lab with other kids, and in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show. 
So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. 
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses, and another doctor across from me. 
It's packaged up and bundled up. 
It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it. 
He said, "If you don't want to follow my instructions, go away." 
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet. 
Do a little more complicated instrument." 
That's a great question. 
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes. 
The second thing is, the health issue. 
It's value created by the participants for each other. 
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean. 
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world, but after all, scientists also do experiments, and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments. 
It's a delight to use. 
This is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their Nike+ system. 
And this is what the next piece is about. 
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone, and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. 
And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience in the video game world? 
This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. 
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very, very smooth. 
Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. 
This is pretty amazing. 
These transactions create allies, not enemies. 
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?" 
And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. 
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya. 
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead. 
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself. 
I took these back to the lab. 
But we've put a long-life battery backup on here. 
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. 
And he's never been back to his country since. 
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes. 
Man: Today you're invited to a peaceful march. 
It's been a total home run. 
That's the kind of power I feel in this room. 
And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright, William Archer: "Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty." 
It says: Never look at the trombones -- it only encourages them. 
One of the signs is also below the text on the top. 
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this. 
But I had one problem, my paintings never danced. 
Our imagination might shrink; our hearts might dwindle, and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. 
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats, right, to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff. 
Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries. 
But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news, he's a princeling. 
But it was also the signal that capped the use, or overuse, of energy-consuming devices. 
The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. 
And within just 50 years, in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience, we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind. 
And he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. 
Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. 
Anybody know what this is? It’s the peyote cactus. 
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV. 
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. 
They used the same trash to form green manure. 
I wanted to keep us healthy. 
Here's a clue. 
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. 
So some people will go out and get people to be on one team. 
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?" 
And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. 
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again. 
Again and again, they perceived these seven different sodas, not as seven choices, but as one choice: soda or no soda. 
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. 
Another group got an environmental message. 
The third trait is metis, what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word. 
Well, I think all of you can guess that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal. 
This shows Saint Paul's on the left. 
And so we need a process of generating jobs, for ordinary young men, fast. 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. 
So, for example, in a distant era now, it was common when one gave a speech to basically talk like writing. 
He had said, "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed." 
NT: I had bigger ideas. 
So when Al Gore set out to change the world again, he didn't do it by himself. 
(Laughter) It could be an "L," of course. 
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge. 
Even of Salinas. 
But as I said, the military and the police are very different. 
And again, you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will. 
All my childhood, while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales, my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles. 
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve. 
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. 
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did. 
"No. It's too hard." 
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. 
Nonetheless, in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago, I decided I would try and do that. 
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra, latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. 
For example, how we started: Ratan just began with a five-engineer team, young people in their mid-twenties. 
(Laughter) Beneath it is a wonderful knife. 
So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. 
So these things together give us evolution, perhaps. 
There was the local grocer there -- a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. 
This is a Christmas tree of a fish; everything on this fish lights up, it's not just that lure. 
You can see a lot of stars. 
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air. 
So even though time goes on forever, space is limited to us. 
Because their teachers say that after the session is over, the children continue to Google further. 
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to, and by studying, the collective. 
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year. 
Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. 
In particular, it tells us why we see immorality. 
KA: On the Hudson River? 
In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. 
You see, then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country, and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where, maybe, the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country. 
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. 
And why is the physiology different? 
Look at what she has done. 
We think of it as maybe too silly, too unnecessary. 
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country. 
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims. 
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. 
It is just a large primate brain. 
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. 
What we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator. 
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. 
If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens, that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years. 
If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off, and prevents another fire from starting. 
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives. 
That's what we've achieved as a species. 
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. 
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves. 
There was data within the streams of news that we consume. 
We set up a website and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open," since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course. 
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit. 
But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message: May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal, or to that college roommate, or to some person you may have turned away from. 
The breeze passes through them. 
(Laughter) And the question he had is, "Can I do it? Can it be done?" 
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. 
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example. 
I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. 
And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing that teaching and counseling. 
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity? 
So I whistled along with him. 
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger. 
Her mother was often told by other women, "You and your child will die poor." 
It seems to me that there are five key lessons that I've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting. 
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system. 
So what do we do? 
And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. 
Now, one of the things that I refer to when I -- about the importance of this message -- is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University, where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior, and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine. 
What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine, Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building this three-story floating school for the kids in Makoko. 
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. 
It's about creating a social impact. 
This is another leader of his people. 
Are the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react? 
We called the project CyArk, which stands for Cyber Archive. 
After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program called "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is. 
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole. 
Now, I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen, so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers, the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause) Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here. 
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever. 
On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together as a community, from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. 
And I began to think, I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input -- as if food and information were similar in some form or shape. 
I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off." 
Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with. 
I wish to go to school." 
She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. 
Seriously. 
And from that you have new possibilities for computing. 
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. 
You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. 
It will dry up inside. 
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching. 
"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?" 
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. 
(Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. 
So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally. 
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall. 
They think, "No, there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness." 
But guess what? You're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam. 
And I bet you one of you, if not more, has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- (Laughter) in the last day or last week, right? 
And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization, and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story, a new poetry, a new romanticism. 
And the photos kept traveling even without us. 
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way. 
My dad never wore it, so I didn't see why I had to. 
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with. 
Times Square is now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet. 
(Applause) The Hindus say, "Nada brahma," one translation of which is, "The world is sound." 
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world. 
Thank you. 
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. 
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no. 
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index, or the NPI-16, is a reassuring 0.31. 
You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back. 
We've made half-a-billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon. 
And the hardest part about that is probably the light, because it means you have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world. 
And when that was discovered, it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum. 
And as you go up towards the top of the graph, what you see is each dot is a trial. 
We've got this trillion hours a year. 
Five, the consumer society. 
I mean, big piece at the molecular level. 
And if you push that all the way down, really, it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. 
But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface, is done spectacularly badly. 
But maybe you don't have to do it alone. 
And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape. 
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia. 
The light organs under the eyes are flashing. 
First you get one stone, then several more, and more and more and more and more, and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter) But they can damage your windshield, so you're not happy with that. 
So, Dan [Barber], if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm, I know where to get them. 
So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. 
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way. 
But down there, there is no sun, there is no photosynthesis; it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it, and it's all so ephemeral. 
Unrelatedly -- (Laughter) Japan is doing crazy things with toilets. 
And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient. 
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. 
I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were. 
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool, right, because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue. 
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make. 
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story. 
But there will also be large fluctuations. 
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning. 
They had zero impact on energy consumption. 
OK, I'm going to do another cut. 
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations. 
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity, a whole range of things. 
It's now more than 82 percent. 
The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. 
This was done in like two or three days. 
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. 
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built. 
So, well he did. 
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers. 
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules, rules where businesses earn a small profit, so they have an incentive to sign up more customers. 
And the people that went there absolutely loved it. 
And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues. 
We're now riding along with Voyager 1. 
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year. 
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. 
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. 
We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. 
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. 
I love this guy; his expression is priceless. 
Is it that I analyze the data very well? 
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation. 
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg. 
Of course, they were confused. 
We are here on top. 
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? 
Do I agree with the assumptions? 
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles, you fly 37,000 feet. 
If those people had voted for Obama, even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely. 
And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that. 
And what you see, for example, if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment, and then if you ask people where it was, but you've made the environment bigger, where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out. 
They said, "Yes, we did." 
Here are three questions drawn from my work. 
It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street. 
The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. 
They commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate, and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts. 
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that. 
So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning. 
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater, which is just a saltwater tank with three seats, and then right behind it we set up this space, which was the tutoring center. 
But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. 
Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. 
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly, from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes. 
It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story, but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London, the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story, in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. 
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. 
And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat? 
So we call this the slicer mode. 
Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher. 
Now, if you think that's kind of neat, the story gets really neat right now. 
And see what his response is. 
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. 
Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris, we seem to have drifted away. 
(Applause) Look at what Rojadeen has done. 
There's a wire dangling down either side. 
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. 
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters. 
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. 
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it, and that is all of us are makers. 
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying. 
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler. 
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. 
I think it was a tactic of survival. 
As I should have shown this earlier, it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria. 
And they're investing in energy. 
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean. 
One gram of gold is 30 euros. 
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. 
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this." (Laughter) "And I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop, and as soon as I did, you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad, and you said, 'Look at that. Look at that. 
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times, we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. 
And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it. 
(Applause) (Applause) June Cohen: I have some questions. 
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held." 
We'll find some that work. We'll build on those. 
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. 
I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. 
We started with two schools. 
It's in his book "The Four Loves." 
Some architectures. 
So they did that, and over the last two years, over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype, using what my students call the granny cloud. 
I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter) So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) — And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you. 
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. 
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it -- aside from the fact that I thought he was insane -- I got that thump in my chest, just that "huh?" 
She's totally not kidding." 
Well my personal story, my personal journey, what brings me to the TED stage here today, is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond. 
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. 
Japan is rather different though. 
And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal? 
There's another reason as well. 
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides, nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. 
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see. 
Here's a biometric device: a pair of Apple Earbuds. 
And just by using cold water going through the water pipes, you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium, so you can create that comfort, and then by adding dry air instead of down-chilled air, the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs, to their individual energy balance. 
And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy. 
We've seen how distributed networks, big data and information can transform society. 
In the palace, just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines, there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. 
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this. 
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here, you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on YouTube. 
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power. 
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions. 
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information, and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information. 
But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated. 
All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. (Laughter) I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. 
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos. 
The Chinese government blocked every single international Web 2.0 service, and we Chinese copycat every one. 
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. 
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef. 
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important. 
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful, because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways: It's buying you out of your obligation, for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful. 
I'll look away from the picture. 
That's an absolutely possible scenario. 
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out, trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model, in a digital world, that's going to lead to the most innovation? 
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram. 
Others look at her before moving off. 
And actually, we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well-being. 
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. 
But kids, you can see these signs in them. 
Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV, a much wilder target. 
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one. 
It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology, and it's not using the best people. 
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. 
Mostly they're worried about each other. 
So why are we not eating insects yet? 
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle. 
I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work." 
Now, maybe that's not true in this room, but it's going to be true in a lot of different places. 
And you're like, "Holy shit! 
But over the course of several years, I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. 
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape. 
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable. 
And of course, neither of these things happened. 
And that's going to happen one arena at a time, one institution at a time. The forces are general, but the results are going to be specific. 
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain on a chip. 
I have to tell you a little bit about my family. 
And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. 
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you -- a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film. 
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax. 
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit, who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I. 
First, no real sports fan would talk that way. 
In science, we don't care how many letters you have after your name. 
You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void. 
Let's move on to something else. 
What if we had a very low commitment, but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed? 
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that. 
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself." 
You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. 
(Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. 
But it doesn't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials. 
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. 
It's one of my favorite bathing suits. 
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea. 
Thank you. 
We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. 
Thanks for listening. 
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. 
For example, I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine, but I can't afford to buy an ad in it. 
But inevitably, these tumors progress towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here. 
So how do we do that? 
So that's how those images were made. 
For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. 
That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive -- that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. 
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well. 
And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story. 
We clearly can. 
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they usually don't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author, and vice versa, connecting and empathizing with the narrator. 
Six months later, we did a location-aware album for Central Park, a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall, with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir. 
Then no, it does not deserve protection. 
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does. 
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products. 
Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. 
So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen. 
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business. 
It's all about the visceral experience. 
are Nike T-shirts that are almost identical to one another. 
I guess, you know, he was the big hero. 
Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. 
You and I, only two. 
Crowd: Whoa! 
And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. 
But maybe there is another problem as well. 
One of the things that a stuntman often does, and you'll see it every time in the big movies, is be blown through the air. 
They talk about it. They've sanitized it. 
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago, or created a few years ago. 
One is the reward system, and that's fed by the chemical dopamine. 
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling, they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. 
What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television, and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. 
Look what happens. 
What does it look like? 
And they say, "So how can I be a sociologist? 
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. 
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautify lawns, parkways. 
And here it is, figure-ground. 
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? 
We can strip that tissue very economically, and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global. 
But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value. 
But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger" and blend them together. 
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. 
I never once was asked for a donation, which had kind of been my mode, right. 
I sometimes wonder. 
And if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries' carbon emissions, it would come in about sixth, somewhere near Germany. 
When you look at a penis in cross section, it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton. 
And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition, but this being Israel, the warden somehow made it happen. 
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all. 
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data. 
The great University of California university system, the great things that have gone on, won't happen. 
Well a good place to start is with waste. 
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain. 
And it got me wondering: If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk? 
They lack even the most basic amenities. 
And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him, if you can figure out who this person is," because all I had was his name -- Ray -- and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. 
So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2. 
Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera, they're cracking up. 
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same. 
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen? 
But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. 
Another thing that helped me as a little kid is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners. 
You really reduce congestion quite substantially. 
And in a weird way, that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. 
Or the sensual feeling. 
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds. 
Yes. They agreed with Warren. 
Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. 
I tagged along with my neighbors. 
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. 
People's memories inflate what they think they saw. 
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth. 
Child mortality is down by two-thirds. 
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. 
And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in 2012. 
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it. 
(Applause) Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French? 
And we have a school. This is our bright -- we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school where we have 850 children, and the majority are women and girls. 
She said, "That's nice, dear." (Laughter) I said, "Pass me the yellow pages." 
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth. 
They wanted to stir up controversy. 
That is me playing my imaginary piano. 
All of this has happened in my lifetime. 
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things. 
Now, that's all well and good for things that we've seen, but of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. 
(Laughter) Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. 
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats. 
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. 
And it's all part of the same design. 
(Laughter) And they are plaiting hair. 
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do, whether you want to replace a vein or a bone, or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt, maybe carry your drugs in your pocket, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert, the answer may be in a thread of silk. 
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. 
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard -- the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear, the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang. 
(Laughter) These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else. 
In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance. 
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. 
You know, when you ask the world's best economists, you inevitably end up asking old, white American men. 
Well, the heart beats, rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully. 
If you're a games company, and you've got a million players in your game, you only need one percent of them to be co-developers, contributing ideas, and you've got a development workforce of 10,000 people. 
So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter. 
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet. 
Harvest bombs. 
Now, truth in advertising. Right? 
(Laughter) So what would some of the specific challenges look like? 
I was so inspired. 
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?" 
That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb. 
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite. 
We've got a choice before us. 
I'm going to make a cut right there. 
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. 
Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try, if appropriate, to change our relationship to the past. 
I felt I was not alive anymore. 
Now this happens very fast, in the blink of an eye, so, together with LG, we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second. 
But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. 
Best example: who in the music industry, 30 years ago, would have said, "Yes, let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. 
Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) A few months ago, a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live, and she was brought in confused. 
And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail. 
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles, there was olives, those little white onions. 
When I do a trick at a party -- (Laughter) that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again. 
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. 
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs, all of which went wrong, and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. 
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. 
In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. 
So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it." 
Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. 
It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head. 
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter. 
It's all about you and me. 
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP. 
Why do I do this? 
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation, that cookout is a mostly black conversation. 
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco." 
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. 
So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago, we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. 
And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. 
(Applause) I'm a filmmaker. 
So making a living is not that easy for young people. 
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines. 
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity. 
Thank you for joining us today. 
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude. 
So following the agile model, we ask three questions: What worked well in our family this week, what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead? 
Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. 
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it'?" (Laughter) And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit. 
Why don't we try changing it every day?" 
I should point out at this time -- I'm not a sculptor; I'm a hard-edged model maker. 
She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her. 
There's a lot of research and a lot of failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error -- that goes into each and every dish, so we don't always get it right, and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people. 
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth, but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today. 
So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds? 
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. 
And we know that the issue is not just production of food. 
We have to change it to something much more technical." 
Fast-forward, 2004: In the peak of our activism, the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you. 
So the question arises: when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are? 
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant. 
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call. 
I don't know, because I never did it, but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. 
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. 
And I stopped expecting things to really change. 
My desire to disappear was still very powerful. 
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands. 
If someone punches me -- and because of my personality, this is recently a regular occurrence -- I understand where the pain comes from. 
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. 
If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future, try China -- there's old Confucius. 
The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. 
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. 
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common: both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another, and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots. 
And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. 
They are posh, they're wealthy, they're less likely to have outdoor jobs, they're less likely to do manual labor, they have better social support, they're less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating, interlocking social, political and cultural reasons, they are less likely to have skin wrinkles. 
Right now, maybe you're thinking, "Wow, this is fascinating," or, "Wow, how stupid was she," but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you. 
So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis, propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this, which lies in our brains. 
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. 
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half. 
And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated, and you can use them too, because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. 
We need to make the same approach with the Internet. 
But they find it completely obvious to use computers, websites, make videos, so on and so forth. 
And I just wanted to play it for you. 
So we can ask: What is compassion comprised of? 
And what Rayan did then is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half, and he looked at me and he said, "Baba, I want you to come with me to my office in my house. 
In places like Denmark and Germany, they've maxed out on wind already. 
Okay, hands down. 
And I know that kids get concussed every year. 
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile, and so we have to move very quickly. 
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute, her every nuance, my very own. 
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead. 
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. 
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves. 
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. 
And he stopped doing this. 
From then on, I was raised as a single child by a single mother. 
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider. 
You start looking at how the global plane flights move, and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. 
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. 
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. 
But consider the following: if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone, which are shared by everyone. 
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. 
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. 
One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question, but from a simple gesture of hospitality. 
(Video) And that may be just the beginning! 
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor, was one of the first men in to clear up the mess. 
And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions, and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly, which he deserved -- he had invaded another country. 
Some of them are very easy. 
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the "I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left." 
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area, "You see that mountain over there?" 
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place. 
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. 
But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire. 
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth. 
And boy do we stink out here. 
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression. 
Larry Burns: Yeah, we're absolutely serious. 
Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals, and humans, over thousands of years, had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. 
(Applause) I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. 
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. 
Why, when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design, should we stop at design and not ask ourselves, how does it apply to our own life? 
It was the largest empire the world had known until then. 
Humor relies on the traditions of a society. 
Which country is that? 
And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 -- we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side. 
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual. 
And finally, we need to really reward politicians. 
We had to beat the European monarchy. 
At least that's what it says on my pen." 
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. 
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. 
And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here, in the really brilliant mind, and we lose a few social circuits here. 
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda. 
Five months later, we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. 
If you look at history, in recent history, you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every 10 or 15 years or so. 
And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories. 
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. 
Because the truth is, when they light their candles at ours, there is twice as much light available for everyone. 
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family, the family households, there's a real hunger for more third places. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
And this idea is actually nothing new. 
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. 
Luckily for us, we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances. 
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require? 
In fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the Earth -- maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going. 
You can walk across to another group, if you don't like your group, etc. 
Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia, hundreds of portraits were made. 
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe? 
So, what is the deal here? 
We give you white pages. Invent. 
You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. 
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. 
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. 
It's actually a measure of mobility based on income. 
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there. 
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical, I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. 
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. 
So a couple. 
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. 
It can know how we're holding it. 
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives. 
He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night. 
Woman: This is it. We're on in two minutes. 
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen. 
Most scientists are really rather dull. 
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population, rising towards 10 billion people, land that is turning to desert, and, of course, climate change. 
I'm now supporting Stewart's position, softly, from a risk-management standpoint, agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident, which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. 
So top six regrets -- the things we regret most in life: Number one by far, education. 
And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. 
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this," and the company said, "Yes." 
Our poetry is our mutation, our life. 
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. 
And the most complex things are ourselves, midway between atoms and stars. 
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough. 
It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it. 
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK. 
Second, I call this the mixer. 
GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work, and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind, but the basic technology works. 
And there I met Francis Crick. 
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone. 
That's a subject that we want to dive into. 
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there. 
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease. 
Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem, namely, light vehicles, here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag, and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. 
And I started thinking about a counseling program. 
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. 
They're not going to die of hypothermia. 
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. 
The new chromosome went into the cell. 
And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible. 
CA: So, what was the impact of that? 
In one month, we completed nine classrooms, over 500 square meters. 
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool. 
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap. 
They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. 
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else." 
But I'm now going to give you an experiment. 
We are very sensitive to the negative, but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity. 
Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc. 
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made. 
Now, they are leaders. 
I started going out on cases. 
Then there's the liger. 
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident. 
Volta's battery works at room temperature. 
Imagine a very popular person in the social network -- like a party host who has hundreds of friends -- and a misanthrope who has just one friend, and you pick someone at random from the population; they were much more likely to know the party host. 
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. 
So the way they work is, you know, you just put your finger in the thing, pull them back, and off you go. 
It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon, but they love this stuff. 
Three times. 
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you. 
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen. 
You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out. 
I would like to encourage you to open your mind. 
(Laughter) In Yemen, most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life. 
Now this is a free app on the App Store, so if any of you guys had this app on your phones, we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. 
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. 
In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA, middle of a peace process. 
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world. 
And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason, but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. 
When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks, you get a very different picture. 
The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. 
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries. 
But even black holes don't last forever. 
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling, one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well. 
And I couldn't. I could not. 
I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all. 
How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars? 
However, there was another case, the Eastland, a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915, and it killed 841 people -- that was 14 more than the passenger toll of the Titanic. 
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life, that's the size it would be. 
And now it's got number power. 
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world, you will see an obsession with binary logic, absolute truth, standardization, absoluteness, linear patterns in design. 
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. 
It's not balanced by any means, not even close. 
And this changes the way people live, move, enjoy the city. 
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds, about life on other planets? 
It's about the same as yours and mine. 
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child, every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever. 
One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet. 
(Applause) I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. 
So, affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. 
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run. 
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. 
But a couple of days later, we thought about it with my students, and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition? 
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world. 
(Laughter) What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. 
I go to work, I check email, I log onto a few more social sites, I blog, I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports, I go look at some videos, pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day, as my day winds down, look at my profile. 
So, there must be underwater hot springs. 
It perpetuates deficit spending. 
And we started putting in roofs that look like this, and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed. 
If the group doesn't take action, the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. 
Because in the long run, I think there is no reason, no practical reason for newspapers to survive. 
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing. 
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. 
Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions, which is food. 
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger, our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy. 
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. 
The DNA matched, and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. 
The second aspect is love. 
I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. 
We're losing them. 
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness": "In everything, uniformity is undesirable. 
It says "U.S. Army" right on it. 
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. 
Because they get tested in nice, safe environments. 
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn. 
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities. 
And that's exactly what the pilot did for me. 
You're all high in openness to experience, and besides, it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures. 
Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body, the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness. 
But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human. 
CA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness, that puzzles a lot of people. 
So I began looking around for -- to see if anyone sold a kit, some kind of model that I could get, and I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures. 
I thank you. 
It takes effort. You need to think. 
Soon food became scarce, with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day -- a quarter of what they consumed before the war. 
(Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. 
He wouldn't have granted the cart, and he had a very interesting dissent. 
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter) For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket." 
But we are many more. 
Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter. 
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it. 
And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. 
Now we've had 50 years of warnings. 
The question is, which god was it? 
Notice the title of the book, "The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic." 
Is that a problem?" 
Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had, in his previous incarnation, been a member of the South African police force. 
But he got great terms on it. 
So we can use technology for governance. 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. 
Texting has a 100 percent open rate. 
And I wasn't that impressed. 
But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. 
I'd never seen anything like that. 
Now while I was writing about this, I came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl. 
And so as we move out, we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here, light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are. 
There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather. 
What can you start counting today? 
This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. 
Then other victims, they got into my sisters. 
Quite extraordinary. 
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. 
That's why we're changing the perception of insects. 
And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is "the ideas that we need to anticipate." 
Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks, but you sound like it when you say "Earth," because that demonstration, if I turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper. 
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down. 
It all begins with empathy. 
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that. 
And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle. 
(Laughter) RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle. 
Which means, "Take my camera." 
Your aorta comes up behind your heart. 
This is my house. 
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow? 
But when our species arose about 200,000 years ago, sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa and spread around the entire world, occupying nearly every habitat on Earth. 
I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life. 
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject, a flap for every leg. 
And she says, "I made that decision, and as soon as I made it, there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me. 
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings. 
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search, and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit. 
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh? 
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. 
And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. 
So if we each do our part, together, we can make a difference, and we can help keep penguins from going extinct. 
It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida. 
And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary. 
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's one in a thousand, that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy. 
I said, "Wow," again. 
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime. 
And then lately, people are very concerned about cooking oil, because thousands of people have been found [refining] cooking oil from restaurant slop. 
But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling, much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. 
They are shaping the way we consume. 
So I had to go through trying to eat again. 
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half." 
And you feel it; you see it every day. 
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. 
Just text us your temperature." 
It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000. 
They should be equal, have no reason to be closer to one African than another African. 
(Laughter) It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. 
The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off. 
If you ask them, they'll say, "Well, you know the coal, we need the coal. 
And it's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education, and in doing so, we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes. 
You know, the criticism is fair; it isn't easy. 
They said, "These two grandmothers ... " "Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening. 
We're seeing the baby brain. 
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan. 
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen? 
Hulu and Netflix, among other companies, have open vacation policies. 
So roughly, we have 50 million data points for a given human brain. 
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle, or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish. 
(Gunshots) Man: These are live bullets. 
So, all of these things -- greater metabolic demands, reduced reproductive success, changes in respiration and metabolism. 
When you're doing mountain rescue, you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue, you look for somebody who knows the terrain. 
It was a machine that was never built, and yet, it will be built. 
This species lives only in the Congo. 
Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us?" 
It's not true. When he was a young man of about 30, he wrote what he called "The Ten Commandments for Conductors." 
So I think it should be really, really clear that our system is broken. 
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside. 
He's a 17-year-old. 
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics. 
Blackouts are not fun. 
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand, and a society on the other hand, were closely related. 
And these are the ultimate literalists. 
And then one day we were out together, and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. 
She said, "But what I worry about the most is not any of that. 
And again, this is a pretty big march to take here. 
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. 
It's great to see. 
One is Education Access for All, setting up schools in small-town India. 
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century. 
Animation and art has always been my first love. 
Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today. 
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. 
(Applause) This is poo, and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you, which might be quite difficult, but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo. 
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models. 
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. 
What is the nature of accidents? 
Now, when we have emotions, we show them. 
You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue, if you pair that odor with a shock. 
And he couldn't escape it. 
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively, hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do, or who we're going to need to be. 
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly, a kind of second skin, which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms. 
The future research is "How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds, without having to plant them every 10 years?" 
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. 
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy? 
And here she is at seven years old, weighing no more than a one year-old baby. 
And so you can see here, old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied. 
Suddenly humans show up -- Homo erectus -- big, old melon-head. 
But when you look up closely, you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through. 
And there are a series of behaviors that we’ve learnt as kids, and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. 
And what he came up with was this guy, the prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine -- a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. 
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously. 
So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome. 
You're being constrained by the public's opinion. 
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. 
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. 
I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet, but maybe there's somewhere in between. 
Yes, all right. 
You can see the skydiver with the red suit, he's in a stand-up position. 
If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur, who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry, and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease. 
It was cancer. It was the bad kind. 
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. 
And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another. 
Two big things happened: First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe; and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language. 
My dad finished dinner early that evening. 
It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along. 
And finally, to pull out all the stops, this is a system called Urp, for urban planners, in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems. 
Why has the idea spread? 
SB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart that you had there. 
And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline. 
And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer, but I realized no one was doing anything. 
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months. 
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density. 
It's women who actually push history forward. 
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem. 
(Applause) So this is a story of a place that I now call home. 
Among those papers, was this binder entitled "FINFISHER." 
My history is Irish. 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. 
Isn't that interesting. 
What will it be tomorrow? 
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again? 
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice, I was blogging live from my tent, sending back a little diary piece, sending back information on the distance I'd covered -- the ice conditions, the temperature -- and a daily photo. 
(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. 
But for those 20 years, an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles. 
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you're all really smart, just do the math. 
People go out and upgrade their toilet. 
And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. 
New organizational models coming about, mixing closed and open in tricky ways. 
And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic -- if you're the CDC or some other national body -- is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions. 
At pick-up time the teachers, who have been with your children all day, would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back. 
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same, Don't see the wall. 
It also leads to status insecurity. 
Audience: What are you reading? 
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. 
Thank you very much. 
She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system. 
Well, we can do a little experiment. 
He was broke all of the time. 
And maybe, just maybe, saying, "Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today." 
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man. 
So we try and get rid of those, and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. 
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37. 
It's like the new sperm donor. 
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families, and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire, and they're going to report being 21 percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter. 
And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. 
You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world. 
We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form. 
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. 
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law, then if you can use violence, if you can use violence with impunity, you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. 
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one. 
Unstable because of the threats of terror, weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. 
So if this was happening, your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint. 
And if you compare light energy to musical scales, it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see, which is right in the middle? 
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here, and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. 
That's what computers allow us to do. 
Using the power of the smartphone, it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds. 
And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market, and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world. 
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not? 
And then that's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really, really interesting, and that's a heat exchanger to a gas. 
You can prove, using Galois' language, there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. 
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did. 
But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative. 
Yes. It can, it does and it will, but for this book designer, page-turner, dog-eared place-holder, notes in the margins-taker, ink-sniffer, the story looks like this. 
(Applause) I would like to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail. 
And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things. 
We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs) It's a great job, really. (Laughter) It's such fun! 
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders, particularly Google and NASA. 
Within a few months, there were two and a half million more girls in school. 
George Church thinks you can. 
And to be totally honest, that's hard for me to stand up here and say. 
The connection with the machine is much more easy, much more even ethically possible. 
Well, they came up with three very general criteria. First is -- and they're listed here. 
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility. 
What's your view on that? 
And then we had the electric washing machine. 
(Laughter) (Applause) SB: This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. 
All the people arrived. 
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. 
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana, and it involves beer. 
And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there. 
But if you keep poking it, it starts to produce light. 
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life, its own customized version of mythology. 
If they equal your feelings, you don't even know you have a model. 
So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging. 
We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. 
So I hope you'll join me on my quest -- you as thought leaders. 
It's a richer experience. 
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison. 
Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning. 
It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us, which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us. 
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand. 
Make a wish. (Blowing noise) Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true. 
I wrote the code and put it out there. 
I hope you are too. 
And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago. 
But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. 
Both my brother and sister and I, all three of us own companies as well. 
So the coordination response asks not, how are these people as employees, but rather, what is their contribution like? Right? 
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. 
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. 
It was a wonderful experience. 
Imagine an education system that started from questions, not from knowledge to be imparted, or started from a game, not from a lesson, or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them. 
The driver pauses after hitting the child, his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second. 
I crumbled. 
Meetup is the platform, but the value here is in social infrastructure. 
And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. 
This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. 
Thank you. 
Do three hours' work. 
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented. 
Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed Americas, for National Geographic. 
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy. 
And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. 
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. 
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector, and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. 
That's what he heard. 
So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances? 
But it might be. 
So this is a real problem -- not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year -- but it's a real problem because, as we're discussing here at TED, the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope, they require global conversations to get to global solutions. 
All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear. 
And so how did she get educated then? 
Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. 
But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. 
At his open prison, he came under the influence of financial fraudsters, and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release. 
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. 
Now, wheat is alive, and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds. 
I do want to leave you with one positive thought. 
I'm influenced by everything I read, everything I see. 
Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?" 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) When we park in a big parking lot, how do we remember where we parked our car? 
And on this day, at this moment, we walked into the house with our first child, our beautiful baby boy. 
I mean, it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. 
He's a multimillionaire, yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence, he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself." 
Approach the cow." 
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this, even though there will be some ozone impacts. 
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. 
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. 
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge. 
This consciousness, though, was a little slow to seep through the general population, even people who were very, very well informed. 
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.'" At age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it. 
And I would actually, I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation. 
But there are only two rules. 
We didn't have any influence then, so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves. 
These are among the world's most admired, most beloved, most innovative companies. 
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. 
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people. 
(Applause) So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world. 
But she wasn't alone that day, because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea, and they do every day. 
Were we being followed? 
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little. 
And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today. 
The second year, it was a total of 15 million. 
We've made into something beyond us. 
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know -- (Laughter) -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes. 
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful, you're probably drawn to the lower two. 
And that sequence was especially difficult. 
When it's on top of the paper board, which is the opposite, it forms this. 
He said, "I'm out of here." 
We have to reach a new level of consciousness, a higher moral ground. 
So, I looked a little further, and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase. 
There's six billion dollars on the table. 
There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. 
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. 
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries, and it's sweeping into management suites. 
I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. 
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. 
Others have a few residents in them, one or two "babushkas," or "babas," which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. 
And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children? 
So penguins learn from previous experience, too. 
(Applause) But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. 
In 1700, in 1800, in 1900, no one cared. 
Everyone there understood the project. 
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest, and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. 
This Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen, boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America. 
We already are all of those things, and we always have been. 
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem, because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. 
The video itself is longer, but here's a short clip. 
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. 
It's essentially a big microwave transmitter. 
Think about that for a minute. 
But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression, I realized that with today's technological resources, there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument. 
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them, have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms, one might -- just might -- find aliens among them. 
This is in the Scottish Parliament. 
But they always stop and take a picture. 
If there's money on the table, they keep it all. 
When someone first suggested this to me, quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy, but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all. 
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. 
That is changing the way we create our organizations, we do our government policy and we live our lives. 
It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around. 
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. 
They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get. 
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. 
I also put in here the stress response. 
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years. 
We didn't even have a telephone. 
Today it's $10,000. Next year it's $1,000. 
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog. 
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7, but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks, or as we call them, factors. 
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha, in Belo Horizonte, in the third largest city in Brazil. 
And with that call, my life would change forever. 
By the end of every holidays, I had to say goodbye to the community, going from one compound to another one. 
(Applause) This is a world-changing invention. 
I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet. 
Summer, fall, winter, spring, noon, dusk, dark, dawn. 
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority. 
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 
A computer magician can write this thing. 
How would I know what I was doing differently? 
I suppose we are." 
But if you text now, or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become, you'll notice that LOL does not mean laughing out loud anymore. 
You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, "This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean." 
Angry, frustrated, really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children, this young girl started a movement, a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace. 
There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that. 
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph. 
In other words, what we do there, we amplify, we amplify the natural control, or the biological control phenomenon. 
There's 100 percent up here. 
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. 
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S., you would be flying at these altitudes. 
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it. 
We did it in three steps. 
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. 
All of that occurs within working memory. 
(Laughter) "... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. 
It was finally being in my body. 
So again, we begin with DNA. 
Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity. 
But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. 
And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams, and those imams would take turns, But the whole community, all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni, would sit together and pray." 
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen. 
The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology. 
Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents, due to alcoholism, domestic violence and general apathy, cannot raise them. 
So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules, but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules. 
So I'll just share a third story. 
And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. 
And he said, "A belief in themselves." 
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it. 
The pain gets less. 
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars. 
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. 
Can everybody see? All right. 
So a very diverse group of people. 
But when that food is there, it's transformative. 
But when it comes down to it, Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- Bush versus Gore. 
So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood. 
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months. 
Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy? 
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions. 
He said, "No, no, no. 
So if you brush up against it, any place you brushed against it, you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking. 
And in fact, what did happen to my brain? 
We tested it a lot, but it could still fail. 
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. 
Thank you. 
Here's what the answers turn out to look like. 
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants." 
It really teaches us who we are, and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world, but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. 
Think about that when you see that building, that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. 
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff. 
Historically, for example, chopsticks -- according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan -- resulted in long-term changes in the dentition, in the teeth, of the Japanese public. 
So, you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets? 
So one of them was fairly straightforward. 
Consider, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their offspring. 
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk, even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. 
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. 
They all went through, and then the border patrol saw my American passport. 
Here was the mall in its heyday. 
So three questions I'd offer you. 
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment. 
What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog. 
And to start those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. 
But this is another, this is the Grand Canal, which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. 
Egypt was up here in 1960, higher than Congo. 
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project? 
Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth? 
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. 
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow. 
Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. 
His mother gave him a part of the garage, and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff. 
Their diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields. 
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize. 
(Laughter) He did it again in 1968. 
She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences. 
Now, this year the Internet turns 20, and Ushahidi turned five. 
Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news. 
It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in. 
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free, and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. 
So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative. 
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens. 
MA: Pretty big. 
That song has been ringing through space for all that time. 
The cold colors, the blue and the black, show areas where we have almost no data. 
He was simply the instrument of God's will. 
And I think that's what I've always been interested in, is that -- which is a personal kind of expression. 
So I started to see the world in a completely new way and I became obsessed with this. 
At some point something clicked. 
And I'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world. 
(Music) Brandi Carlile: ♫ Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods? ♫ ♫ And everything there feels just as it should ♫ ♫ You're part of the life there ♫ ♫ You're part of something good ♫ ♫ If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods ♫ ♫ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♫ ♫ If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods ♫ ♫ Have you ever stared into a starry sky? ♫ ♫ Lying on your back, you're asking why ♫ ♫ What's the purpose? ♫ ♫ I wonder, who am I? ♫ ♫ If you've ever stared into a starry sky ♫ 
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. 
How could we survive that? 
So this is a catastrophe. 
(Laughter) So now, what's great about these free-stylers, they will get cued different words. 
As you probably know, the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. 
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years, he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices. 
And they had certain criteria to do it. 
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. 
This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. 
They lack retention; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale. 
Thursday: Confidence is key. 
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups. 
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks, and use Google Earth in combination with that, you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced, which company is stealing the timber, and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. 
You become part of an "us." 
Everywhere I went, I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. 
Or, people are not people without other people. 
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration. 
(Laughter) But he still knows a good thing when he sees it, and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. 
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States." 
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? 
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. 
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. 
I want to know if there was a moral molecule. 
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. 
And he had a lump of iron. 
Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated, but with my computer, I can communicate more widely than ever before. 
(Laughter) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots. 
And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace. 
We have not had an idea. 
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer, and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. 
Let's just go into the brain for a moment, and see where does happiness arise from in evolution. 
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. 
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle," and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. 
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean, we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down, specifically what that means. 
There's another problem. 
It's using this as risk control, not instead of action. 
With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. 
Play is not frivolous. 
But it has an unexpected twist. 
(Applause) This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts. 
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns. 
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service. 
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice. 
Let me zoom in. 
People thought about, "Oh, my God. 
"And how did the world change after 9/11?" 
But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation, both physical and mental, of these migrant workers. 
They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem, but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. 
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit. 
until I tell you who said it. 
Without a splash, so they can see the fish. 
This is 130-year-old technology, and this is a problem, because over 80 percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers. 
That’s all there is to it. 
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives, and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver, and the good stuff they kept for themselves. 
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened" but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted, I suppose, manifestation of racially-based voting. 
You see here the red roof and the gray roof, and in between them there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second. 
And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life -- a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. 
So I can browse this stuff. 
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. 
The thing is the sun is not always available to you, because at sunset it disappears below the horizon. 
And this is when it really gets interesting. 
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why. 
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it. 
Europe of and by the people, a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders. 
In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years. 
He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life. 
It has a smaller welfare state. 
The Infinity Burial Project, an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. 
Now, mass is the first thing; the second thing, that's shape. 
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying, "This is an amazing thing. Come and see me. 
Don't mourn. Organize. 
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness. 
And I understand that. Who can blame them? 
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness, and whereas almost all the rest of them, regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever -- are almost equally happy on average? 
Pretty? Yes. 
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds, and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today. 
Thank you. 
But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. 
So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias -- it is known as selecting on a dependent variable, something we always tell our students to avoid. 
So really, this is how I would like to describe it. 
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.) A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right. 
I had a degree from Cambridge; I had a thriving career, but my self was a car crash, and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch. 
But it's not. 
I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. 
In fact, he was probably six inches taller than me, and she was about this tall. 
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest. 
So what do I do? I figure I have two options. 
But in the end, amazingly, again, people were able to do it. 
Now today, I told you about very strange and weird protocells -- some that contain clay, some that have primordial ooze in them, some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them. 
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company. 
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. 
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. 
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then. 
A player in a game called "Project Entropia" actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars. 
None of them are tricks. 
And for other projects, like in Paris, it's about the name of the street. 
So I actually designed this back in 2003. 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the history of music and television on the Internet in three minutes. 
There are very important people, business and land assets in Detroit, and there are real opportunities there. 
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others. 
Let me close with another short story. 
We've got to attack that brand in front of them. 
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. 
(Laughter) Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. 
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. 
I know most people don't see it that way. 
So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I. 
It's not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. 
How soon can we bring it out? 
When we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things. 
(Applause) Contagious is a good word. 
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully. 
But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success -- Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. 
And you know, we have a society, a world, that is paralyzed by fear. 
It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. 
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. 
These are real! 
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. 
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. 
They must change behavior in some way. 
Because in its 400 years of existence, storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device. 
But how do you do that? 
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life. 
But I think I don't have to tell this audience that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing. 
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. 
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. 
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. 
All the adults knew the risks. 
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky, and you just keep the shutter open, as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope, it will see something like this. 
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year. 
We're all here, and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event, but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths. 
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. 
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. 
It's masses and masses of layers. 
Three transformations take place in the oven. 
Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration. 
We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments. 
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. 
(Laughter) I started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess -- he doesn't normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models. 
And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat, leaving it all behind. 
It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. 
You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause) So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand. 
And so what you're seeing here -- and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. 
It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. 
His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. 
So we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns. 
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. 
They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are, but they were not allowed to show their strengths, because the world was eaten up by grand corruption. 
Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water, so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound. 
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects. 
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. 
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool. 
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year. 
That, I think, is movement. 
And one of these guys, he must have been 22, he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin. 
There's three sections. 
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers -- amazing, the best in the world -- and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. 
And the bigger the telescope, the bigger that universe becomes. 
I learned that my mom had a right to own property. 
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes. 
Here they are: The Earth is full. 
We got data from the Gallup Organization, which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately. 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. 
But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this. 
And the basic punchline of my talk is, I'd like to turn that over on its head. 
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere. 
We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. 
He didn't know. 
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. 
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick. 
As an architect, I have to confront something like this. 
(Music) Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development across two decades, scientists are exploring how cultural forces (Laughter) may have operated during human evolution. 
But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot. 
Eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in. 
A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief. 
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must be a lot of tigers around. 
(Applause) And I know some of you are Apple aficionados. 
Or do you think they're a cardiologist, a barrister or maybe your local politician? 
There's a mix an inventor has to have. 
In the 1990s, there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. -- child labor, forced labor, serious health and safety abuses. 
This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. 
In the last five years, the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. 
So rather than reinvent the wheel, I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. 
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English." 
So for the past few years, the coastal areas, they found themselves in a shortage of labor. 
That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct. 
These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. 
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here. 
First, don't become a cannibal. 
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. 
And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. 
Remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff. 
As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. 
I said, "Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?" 
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of "crony capitalism," political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don't actually do much good for the rest of us. 
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. 
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity. 
We used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not. 
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill." 
There's a pattern here. 
They were so happy. 
It's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else's life, a journey, an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can't quite believe you've been, especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew and the life you've been exploring is that of Muhammad. 
Life adds information to matter. 
So I leave you with this third question. 
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab, and which show you, in a living brain, the reconstruction of that brain. 
So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for, and in a contained, safe environment, evaluating its effectiveness. 
I went and got golf balls from golf courses. 
So, that primal medium, which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... 
And so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that? 
God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions. 
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job. 
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. 
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing, not just dying, but they're gone. 
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. 
At the time, there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan. 
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still need to drink water. 
He keeps coming back. 
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year, but I remember electronics. 
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait until the experimenter comes back, they can have two. 
We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy-Wire, and we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year. 
There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol. 
It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison. 
They're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them. 
And they're also curiously aggressive. 
And so with this Lego kit, we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA. 
And I said, "So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe. 
They've invented some kind of this thing, or this thing, or this thing that will make our world forever better. 
Obviously, we think of sheep as followers. 
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting, but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas. 
So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive. 
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories, you don't pay as much attention to those packets. 
Sorry, TED. 
And the guy took it apart, and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels. 
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details; the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them. 
So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity? 
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. 
It's taken over a wider geographic area. 
We truly, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- (Laughter) (Applause) Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? -- (Laughter) become a major source of energy ... 
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness -- again, it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed -- the only thing we do really, really well is sweat. 
It's all very one-dimensional. 
And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective. 
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him. 
And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter. 
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. 
And I sat like you guys there in the audience. 
I don't really believe it is. 
The children couldn't hear their teachers. 
So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at. 
And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. 
I found no flaw. 
And six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. 
Any one of the wines served at this tasting, if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know, the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable. 
I should have gotten it so they could have won. 
Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. 
And we went through a variety of worlds. 
That kind of makes sense to us. 
"What have you noticed about what you did?" 
So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models. 
And then in the 1980's, they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective, and within weeks I had started that regimen. 
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. 
And those little red boxes are deaths. 
Now as cool as that sounds, my family was not that thrilled with this. 
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun. 
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues. 
So I was amazed. 
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again -- instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins, wins the New York City Marathon, goes home with a big fat check. 
A couple of them were students in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology. 
It's when the young couple whisper, "Tonight we are going to make a baby." 
Thank you very much. 
Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. 
My day started at 5 in the morning, milking the cows, sweeping the house, cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood. 
And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines, not hard, fast rules. 
We activate communities. 
There was no starting point for peace. 
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition. 
And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting. 
Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail. 
We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. 
But most of our camera people and our journalists, they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily -- to report what happened in Tahrir Square. 
I decided to go, just because they told me to, without trying much. 
This article's about how their lives get ruined. 
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples. 
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home. 
So we resynthesized this song. 
All the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
And don't just find another technologist friend; find somebody different than you. 
And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted. 
We need people who want to do the right thing. 
This was taken under a homeless asylum built in 1885 to house 1,100 people. 
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up. 
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data." 
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. 
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. 
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway. 
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. 
Thank you. 
Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. 
Okay. 
You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery. 
I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling. 
So I would say, coquo ergo sum: I cook, therefore I am. 
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears. 
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down. 
Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. 
She's 37 years old, she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years, and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth. 
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?" 
(Laughter) And in America it was called "Our Final Hour" because Americans like instant gratification. 
There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. 
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and, over the next five days, assemble them into biocomposites. 
Netra and I met when she was 18. 
But we'll pick some place along the curve here, and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses, and that's amazing, right? 
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. 
Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was, you aim for the bush in the distance, and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree. 
This is the so-called slurry wall. 
It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process, not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta-historical information, how is historical knowledge constructed, documenting each step. 
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this. 
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need. 
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic, which turns out to be a supremely logical language. 
When I was mayor of Bogotá, in only three years, we were able to create 70 kilometers, in one of the most dense cities in the world, of these bicycle highways. 
So here I'm -- (Applause) This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. 
Thank you. (Applause) What I want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans. 
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house, sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. 
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?" 
Cities are the origins of global warming, impact on the environment, health, pollution, disease, finance, economies, energy -- they're all problems that are confronted by having cities. 
My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what's been done in string theory, but that's a complicated math thing that I don't yet know how it's going to work out. 
Form follows function? 
Thanks, little guy. 
So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive. 
The first, most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone, having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty. 
In one recent study, we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. 
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be. 
And then I get asked questions. 
Thank you. 
Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides. 
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her, and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. 
(Applause) Let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week, four words that will come to define this century. 
And so it gets down to the brain. 
This includes arson, urban sprawl, acid rain, not to mention terrorism and wars. 
The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. 
So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. 
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. 
And employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work, didn't have the right attitudes and experience. 
And you can do the same randomized, controlled trial for social policy. 
And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid, and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. 
I can see the rocks are over here. 
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. 
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine. 
(Applause) It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and I believe this is true, especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success. 
I said, "Nope." 
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me. 
It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. 
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light. 
It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment. 
And I'll end with that. Thank you. 
And it turns out they almost did. 
Perhaps hire people, give them the skills that they can take back to Africa, and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. 
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. 
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product. 
If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni, we would hit them very hard, and it would be very, very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. 
So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS, and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa. 
He said, "Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor, and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living." 
And tragically, in 1999, when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people, focused on preserving their culture and language, she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. 
I'm sitting on a chair. 
And before you get too worried about it, here in the United States, the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it. 
It's about context. 
And it's pretty amazing actually. 
So they're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line, and they're trucked anywhere in the world, you plop them down, and they produce electricity. 
Ah, sorry about that. 
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. 
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant, they don't seem to be able to figure out, "Do I have a training people issue? 
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this. 
Allow many people to come in. 
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland to get mica. 
And for the next three decades, I was on and off various diets. 
So if you look at this, you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. 
And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find. 
And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on. 
Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible. 
And that's allowing for differences in the cost of living. 
It's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here. 
What would it look like? 
And if you look at the 36 countries with the highest burden of malnutrition, that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy every year. 
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community, which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month. 
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you. 
(Applause) My name is Joshua Walters. 
And that's how I really began. So let's begin. 
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. 
And that can't happen in a classroom. 
We can benefit from others' ideas. 
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground. 
So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. 
The wok shot caught fire three times. 
We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves. 
And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. 
Most of them do very simple things, but if you look along all these different pictures, at rule number 30, you start to see something interesting going on. 
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you. 
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley. 
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark. 
The Chinese restaurant model spreads. 
And collectively, we really didn't know if we could pull this off. 
This is when she had her second daughter. 
Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other, we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. 
And this boat, quite ugly, is called the Mutiara 4. 
Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know, but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility. 
(Applause) I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future. 
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. 
And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships, one of which is education, where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red, and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region, is less educated. It's just a fact. 
Normally we think about technology as interactive. 
Could art change the world? 
And also, the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. 
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier. 
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say, "I'm going through hell," and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay, and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people. 
There's figs and everything else there for the taking. 
With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy. 
It should be built in to all the systems we use. 
We need to face our fears and take back our streets, our cities, our neighborhoods. 
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering. 
It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT. 
This must be true because a Scotsman said it. 
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated. 
It's the myth that we live in. 
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes. 
On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. 
We have oxytocin that connects us to others, makes us feel what they feel. 
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics. 
So that is it. 
Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites. 
We use this idea called self-assembly. 
And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe, and he connects this to a container, and he fills the container up with green ink. You with me? 
Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape? 
Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. 
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building. 
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. 
And I did my first "expo de rue," which means sidewalk gallery. 
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are. 
I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo." 
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project, you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model. 
You take all of the conflict, all of the chaos, all of the noise, and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict. 
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters. 
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water. 
I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. 
He sees something in the path. 
The problem is that we play the role of victims. 
The first principle of aid is respect. 
It comes from the World Values Survey. 
While you're waiting around for your nuclear, you have to run the regular electric power grid, which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. 
And I'll expand this up. 
Okay, so that's the lens. 
This is what we hope may happen. 
We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one-by-one. 
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. 
It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people, and especially in Africa and China. 
And I thought that was the norm, because I had never seen fish like this. 
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day. 
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists, and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution. 
So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift. 
The first, if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision. 
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. 
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe, the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan, it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface. 
But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage, excessive borrowing in the private sector. 
(Laughter) (Applause) The second example from music is from John Cage's modernist composition, "4'33"." 
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade. 
What would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment? 
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. 
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. 
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything. 
And I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus. 
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack. 
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. 
And this man, Archie Cochrane, is a prisoner of war and a doctor, and he has a problem. 
Because it's not the right time. 
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen. 
I end with a few quotes. 
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves. 
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act, video, audio, or peer pressure, we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. 
And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses. 
We don't know, but what can we do? 
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back. 
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure. 
Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.) (Laughter) (Applause) You know, it's interesting. 
HK: Yay. 
And you can never replicate that performance twice. 
They're referred to as nuclear batteries. 
We should be talking about half, a quarter, one-tenth the energy content. 
Thank you. 
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. 
I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane. 
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. 
And if we were -- (Applause) If an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away, and lit a candle -- a single candle -- then we would be able to detect it, using the GMT. 
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye. 
Because he blogged about the car. 
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. 
And it doesn't have to be this way. 
Well, we have to take a little excursion, and we'll start in central Texas. 
And it leads to reservations and other techniques. 
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing? 
Secondly, there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. 
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. 
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. 
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, "Solly, you are pathologically helpful." 
And then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it. 
AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine. 
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers? 
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative? 
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. 
They're very low to the water, and they're all uninhabited, except one island has about 35 caretakers on it. 
In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders. 
You can see here, over at the end, our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos, and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. 
And we have a problem-solving technique that works. 
Where's the right finger? 
Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. 
You ruined my life, but you gave me an incredible future. 
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. 
There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: that of personal storage. 
He panicked about being able to support his family. 
Extremely effective, it really did -- somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. 
So to investigate immorality, let me bring you back now to 1980. 
(Laughter) I'm used to a stationary mic. 
Nothing takes longer than two weeks. 
Think about Toyota. 
In the teacher's contract, it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year. 
I watch faces. 
Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut. 
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish, and it turns it to look like beef. 
Not much has changed in those 50 years. 
So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. 
Now, these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple. 
And that brings us to the mythology of business. 
Why can everyone do it? 
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. 
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. 
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing? 
Thank you very much. 
Europe, despite its recent failures, is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment. 
What about the origins of agriculture? 
And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm. 
But what about the self? 
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. 
Is there a sustainable solution? 
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. 
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface. 
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. 
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home. 
It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word." 
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. 
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. 
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. 
Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue. 
But we know how to fix this. 
A project called TEEB was started in 2007, and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8+5. 
To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white. 
And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there. 
Yes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer, that's all, of Christmas gifts. 
He had a side parting and a neat mustache. 
It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle. 
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard. 
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. 
Now there are 192. 
The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers, because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry -- in particular, those flames underneath the burger. 
All right, let me show you some more about this. 
My father worked as a policeman in the city. 
If he's using landmark orientation, he should be able to find the burrow, because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it. 
From about 10 billion in 1990, it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today, and it shows no sign of slowing down. 
First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. 
There is no need to use violence. 
There is no orchestra conductor. 
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. 
He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 -- which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died. 
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here? (Singing) You know what happens? Gravitation is no more. 
How about fitness? 
Would we see 544 airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months, or a year? 
Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. 
This -- you can put details, toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. 
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor. 
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is -- is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten -- but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old, and it's framed above my desk at home. It says, "Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile." 
(Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does? 
Very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery, who found that people who faced a brick wall versus people who looked out on trees and nature, the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer, needed more medication, and had more medical complications. 
KB: James and our country director in Ghana, Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people, from the fishing industry, for enslaving children. 
And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else. 
We know the symptoms. 
The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space, and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe. 
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies. 
Humans ran and ran all the time. 
All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place. 
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. 
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community? 
So for example, Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps. 
So she took it. 
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director. 
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward. 
Now let's ask ourselves, what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future? 
E: Beer. 
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego -- similar island, similar people. 
So this is what he built. 
But my personal favorite of these ones, I have to confess, does actually come from the United States: "Officers Taser 86 year-old disabled woman in her bed." 
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings. 
I could go on about this at great length, but I won't. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: Stephen Wolfram, thank you. 
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference. 
(Laughter) What matters is what we mean by those symbols. 
It looks beautiful. 
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami. 
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter. 
Now, a funny thing started happening. 
So this is Doug Engelbart. 
But in case you do, here it is: they're waiting, we're waiting for you to show us where to go next. 
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills, down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute. 
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. 
By monitoring the friends group, we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. 
A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity, and even general relativity and gravitation, and at least give hints of quantum mechanics. 
So what did they do? 
But certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious. 
You think, what should I do? 
They are stories with a twist. 
And more importantly, when you're actually at the site of the memorial, you can see those connections. 
And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... 
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties. 
That night in my apartment, after I got done kicking myself and so forth, I lay in bed for a long time, and I thought about skin grafts. 
Now you have to remember, this is 10 years before Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves -- 15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit -- nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast. 
And the table form is important, and since it's touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab, or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table. 
And without them we wouldn't be here. 
We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children. 
He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people. 
We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers. 
He said he didn't know. He would ask around. 
(Laughter) But the fact is, there's good people everywhere. 
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- So let me show you the shape-changing mobile. 
The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. 
So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. 
It would require great solidarity and support from other countries, and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air. 
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. 
Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. 
So we've been working with Transport for London, and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years. 
What you're looking at in here is a 3D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [the] cloud of points in real time, cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions. 
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. 
They have lost. 
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK. 
(Laughter) And as they whiz by you, it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill. 
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. 
And there's many of them, all over its entire body. 
It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. 
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. 
Here it is back at home at that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later, working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics. 
Compassion is also curious. 
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment. 
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt, anyway -- (Laughter) but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead. 
And to me, this is research misconduct. 
Powered by my solar panels, it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater. 
Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. 
(Laughter) He was much younger in those days, and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. 
A real school. 
The machine itself would start the music. 
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. 
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us. 
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. 
They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye. 
So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows. 
There are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries, that aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States. 
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development -- and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. 
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible, by all means, climb in and take the plunge. 
And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. 
Now we're on the upswing. 
This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care, in fixing health care. 
The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. 
This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth, and this, again, what the GMT will see. 
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. 
But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player. 
We now call this place home. 
We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. 
This is my story. 
If what we're worried about is poverty and development, sub-Saharan Africa is far more important. 
We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. 
He said, "You're not my son anymore." 
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. 
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material, and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. 
Where's the brain trust that's in error here? 
(Laughter) No. So I had to think a little harder. 
And the more you understand that, the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. 
And in the last paragraph of the book, it's a kind of stylistic mark, because normally Charles Darwin stored, in the last paragraph of a book, the most important message. 
This is the new frontier, if you will. 
So I said to my assistant, "Invite the other women permanent representatives." 
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. 
Somi. 
(Applause) Then I looked on the list of fittest cities, and we were on that list. 
All of us are refugees. 
Call it impossibly idealistic if you must. 
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them. 
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper. 
The conversation will go better." 
But looking at video clips posted by strangers, a world of possibility opens up for him. 
And our prison system itself is stuck. 
But guess what, nobody will really care. 
It can't be artificially evoked. 
And to the person who was promoting it said, "The atmosphere's much more complicated." 
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here. 
You just pick them up with both feet. 
We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. 
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known. 
That's what it's shrunk to. 
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world. 
They were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done. 
That changes our climate. 
Another millimeter? 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thanks. 
My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp. 
Well, to conclude, I can say that we made a material using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. 
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. 
You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you're an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you're Freudian, or your mother, if you're Jewish. 
He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice, sustainability and people's well-being. 
Could we have the solutions? 
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back, which in New England happens very, very quickly. 
Thank you. 
I've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids, thank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues, believing and supporting me. 
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. 
It's not a dirty word. 
In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals, which is the case in the temperate zones, you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops. 
And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately, is not very reliable. (Laughter) Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life" 
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile, and it happens to be 3,000 years old. 
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. 
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now. 
When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff: wood and nails and rope and wheels, and lots of tools, real tools. 
And he told them, "Question the unquestionable. 
You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
In fact, when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth -- about one percent, two percent a year -- that was when India was least democratic. 
They will fall into black holes. 
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. 
I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. 
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room. 
And so KIPP is doing it. 
They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. 
And she started, in the face of a lot of controversy, the Women's Health Initiative. 
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative. 
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally, one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife. 
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics. 
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness. 
Welcome to a decent life. 
And now the most important thing, that is the mood onstage. 
So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations, thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list, but you can find effective organizations, and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor. 
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter, when she turned seven last year, said to her mother, my daughter, "So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State? 
Now, what hard problem is being solved here? 
Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions. 
We have 4,000 companies who are members. 
(Laughter) (Applause) HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. 
But there is a problem with that view. 
And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter. 
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. 
It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. 
There's no accident in names of these restaurants. 
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake. 
Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts, the first to be selectively bred for production traits, the first animal to be cloned. 
So we can now, in a matter of hours, determine a whole human genome. 
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. 
The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious. 
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face? 
Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other, as social beings. We do it all the time. 
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. 
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. 
Julia Bacha: When I first heard about the story of Budrus, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago, in 2003. 
(Laughter) And my mother was Irish Catholic, and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously. 
And that includes our own bodies. 
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. 
It could be something like a wind farm. 
Child: So he won't know which one is his. 
It can be anybody's game. 
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species. 
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth. 
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today." 
I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer. 
And so when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development, and I'm flying home and I'm thinking, "We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations," you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder: to these far-flung places? 
Sort of like a digital Jiminy -- as in the well-known fairy tale -- a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. 
We can reform our electoral systems. 
We wish we'd gotten more of it. 
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale. 
It's got no reflective symmetry. 
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made. 
We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. 
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries? 
And Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water. 
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is --- (Laughter) (Applause) This is one of the first images that comes up. 
(Laughter) Alright what about problems? 
That's the life everyone sees. 
And then it was abandoned. 
These are happy vocalizations. 
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front, and I climbed in the back. 
The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. 
His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains. 
One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. 
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? 
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes, is this note that says, when asked, what do you think of conventional foie gras? 
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. 
We all were at that age. 
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA. 
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it. 
All parties, all factions in society, backed this. 
You know? 
Daylight, you could call it, transparency. 
He showed how all of this can be put together. 
And this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented. 
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity. 
In this case, you actually can. 
And the population will double in one generation. 
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. 
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding, may not be enough, at least not alone. 
In one of them, one of the kids once said, "When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea -- and he's talking about this spot here -- "I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. 
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money, to learn new skills, and to see the world. 
Cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity. 
So really, the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life, where we have fire management, elephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem, and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions. 
Design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate. 
SW: There we go. 
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals. 
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there. 
(Applause) AG: Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari, again in Champaran. 
We're back where we were in the 1970s. 
It's wonderful. 
If you think about the sorts of things that we've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years, we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan, but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on. 
But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air. 
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated, but everybody gets the idea. 
And when a police officer stood in the road, our vehicle should understand that this means stop, and when they signal to go, we should continue. 
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history. 
Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers, because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle, and you believe it will last forever. 
Bell says, "What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland?" 
The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. 
You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. 
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter. 
(Laughter) Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this. 
In the histogram before you now, the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures, going back about far as we have temperature data. 
Maybe we're not the right people to do it. 
And so students like myself with nothing to do, we would learn how to program it. 
I would caddy, I would go to the golf course and caddy for people. 
Dana: But I can't help. 
This, too, is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. 
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. 
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy. 
(Laughter) I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. 
But it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful. 
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt. 
A morning that I will never forget. 
A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. 
And so, you tell them your theory and they say, "No, no, that's not the way consciousness is! 
I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen. 
It operates like a safety deposit box. 
The ideas are coming back from the consumers, and they're often ahead of the producers. 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that. 
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods, and for me the abaya, my traditional dress that I'm wearing today. 
(Laughter) But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and -- (Laughter) (Applause) Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. 
Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer. 
I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company. 
And when Noah had done built his Ark ... 
Back before the turn of the century, women had another problem. 
It's not pleasant. 
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. 
This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. 
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage. 
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator. 
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye, and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. 
Already 600 installations. What is my mission? 
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby." 
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement. 
(Applause) I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. 
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks. 
And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it. 
This is what we need to do with heart disease now. 
Wow! People noticed. And notice they did. 
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process. 
See this hand? 
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code, it's wrapped around these purple proteins -- or I've labeled them purple here. 
Let me turn from jobs to the second objective, which is improving basic social services. 
We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen. 
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up, some 50 years ago, with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar, which is a transistor. 
And I'm making all those kinds of windows. 
(Applause) BR: And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger, which is a cool side effect. 
This is all you. And this is all us. 
And you have all these pathways going on at the same time. 
We tell stories all the time about everything, and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place, and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it. 
We met her on our first family vacation. 
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers, who all performed there, get their own Casa da Musica logo. 
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease, but they are very rare. 
Where deserts freeze and waters boil. 
So we came up with these two rules. 
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. 
And to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers, there's a bale of hay there and some crab apples. 
Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this. 
Too often these days, rounds look very much like this, where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient. 
Is it really yours?" 
And in this case, this object is -- plays on a host of levels. 
Do we pursue happiness with hostility? 
I'm feeling it here. I feel it here. 
It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite, that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life, rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter. 
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours. 
Print scaled. 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. 
PM: I don't think so. (Laughter) NA: But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society. 
But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. 
Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing, and some winning. 
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory. 
How do you reconcile that? 
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is. 
So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. 
And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. 
They have often been rejected by their families, have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them. 
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely. 
I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you, and there are no easy answers with this. 
(Applause) Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge, because different from health or education or housing, it tends to get worse as societies become richer. 
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here? 
Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness, are happiness in another's happiness. 
What's on the roof of that barn? 
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago, this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people. 
And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. 
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen. 
(Laughter) And those issues stayed with me and guided me, and in particular, when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland, from 1990 to 1997. 
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta -- we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease. 
It has administrators in it and many, many other things. 
(Applause) What is so special about the human brain? 
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere." 
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. 
So what Prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see: what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts? 
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?" 
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. 
(Laughter) but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future. 
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. 
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway? 
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York. 
So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years. 
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. 
So if you think about this practically, here's where we are. 
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab, we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope, and they see something in the tissue sample. 
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter. 
So this is a virus-based solar cell. 
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history. 
It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding, reveals the strengths and weaknesses, and yes, like some of the speakers before, the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and it does then become, that process, part of normalization. 
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. 
In Britain, it could mean looking to the French, learning from the French, getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system. 
And because we cannot do it on our own, we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author, any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education, can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming. 
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen. 
There's a new quality in this work. 
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) There's a group of people in Kenya. 
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion? 
(Laughter) So it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. 
We need firms. The firms have gone away. 
Turn it on; turn it off. 
I mean, here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch, this little passion that had developed, then they thought they were fighting the Cold War, and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. 
And here the income per person in comparable dollars. 
So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. 
And anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way. 
It means if I get to the end of my life, the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot? 
And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves. 
Once more, humility, limits, honesty, realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. 
I took the three elements -- stomach, small intestine and colon. 
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. 
(Applause) So the bandstand, as we call it, this is an incredible space. 
Wear a helmet. 
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote, and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here. 
What were those shows? 
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size. 
This is a quiz. What do you think? 
So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be. 
People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic. 
So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round. 
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it: "no to military rule." 
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. 
And the good news, this one's a monster. 
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money. 
I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. 
(Applause) The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression, unless it is so clinically brutal, man. 
And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff, you need a lot of data. 
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. 
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute. 
So how do we operationalize the question of content of character? 
People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. 
If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. 
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds. 
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village, population eight. 
This innovation is from the slums of Rio. 
It's gardens watered by running streams. 
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top, and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells, relay the information to the brain, where we see that as perception. 
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system. 
It is simply how we protect our walls. 
"Know thyself," that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling. 
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth," "democracies can't grow." Actually India could. 
Now, I've got an example here from Canada. 
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle, I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject, and that anyone can discover something new. 
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now. 
Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. 
For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. 
(Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.) Her uterus would be torn. 
"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that, while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter) Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force," which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. 
Well, amazingly, in places like India where costs are very low, that family, that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost, amortized across the rest of the work, was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. 
They've got to learn how to do something else. 
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut. 
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. 
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. 
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too. 
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer. 
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No." 
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. 
In fact, I've got 38,000 of them now and no Kindle in sight. 
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it. 
So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. 
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. 
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas. 
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. 
So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. 
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. 
And I like to show how it looks and how it works. 
And to explain why this is so, I have a question. 
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it. 
I mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem? 
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data, trends and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere. 
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation? 
(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.) Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.) DR: She offers water, and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. 
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list. 
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design. 
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground." 
In a nutshell, this research suggests that among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidents of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. 
Well, you work with the community. 
When I'm sitting in a submersible though, I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all -- I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone. 
She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what's happened to her. 
Thank you very much. 
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible. 
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period. 
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way. 
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift, picks them up, smiles and walks off. 
(Applause) Time flies. 
So I went over, "Excuse me, sir, are you my driver?" 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. 
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. 
I'm not saying that at all. 
And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. 
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems. 
That's the politest description I have for them. 
And they haven't collapsed. 
Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. 
But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. 
Many people will think, though, that charities aren't really all that effective. 
So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now, and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning, not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. 
In my team, the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. 
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. 
In the midst of incredible poverty and loss, people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. 
It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. 
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. 
And for three months out of the year, the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180. 
We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape. 
And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. 
I came this close to doing it. 
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. 
It's a facility which is practically unmanned. 
This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent, from Spain to Korea. 
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed. 
There were three jumps. 
My balloon will expand to 500 times and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top. 
I need some information, and I need a container. 
It's all if. 
If you look at science on one hand, science is a very rational approach to its surroundings, whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings. 
KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect. 
What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side, so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week. 
It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. 
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her. 
It may even be your story. 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. 
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. 
We are, you are, the most underused resource in health care. 
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. 
So if you zoom in on this genome, then what you see, of course, is this double helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters, or we call them bases, right: A, C, G and T. 
We would not be able to process information, metabolize, walk and talk, if we lived in thermal equilibrium. 
And that was a very big part of the buy-in, much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back. 
On June 23rd, 2000, a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, spilling 1,300 tons of fuel, which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins. 
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations, what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. 
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. 
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible, but it's something that really accompanied humanity. 
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular. 
They are going to be cued these three square words: "like," "not" and "head." 
Can you quantify your openness? 
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me. 
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly. 
This is where we are in this process. 
So here's the words: tree, highway, mirror, Saturn and electrode. 
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start? 
We became, or those victims became, more importantly, a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization. 
(Laughter) But that's the nicest thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure, peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity, it could be used to stop smoking in patients. 
There are still no limits. 
So I will spend a little time at the end. 
They're being commodified, and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there. 
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly. 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
(Laughter) TH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. 
And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. 
So this was before the computer was invented. 
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. 
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there. 
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa. 
The good news is that, therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right. 
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. 
This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. 
(Applause) (Guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Distorted guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) (Ambient/guitar music starts) (Music ends) (Applause) One thing the world needs, one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates. 
And this man came up to me and he said, "Why are you dressed like that?" 
Which made me go, "Yippee!" 
And I was so shocked, so stunned, I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?" 
And it happens in different realms. 
When I was in Zimbabwe, we were touring a place with the village chief -- he wanted to raise money for a secondary school -- and there was some construction a few yards away, and I said, "What's that?" 
And then they're going to merge. 
And the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G. 
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. 
(Applause) You all know the truth of what I'm going to say. 
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience. 
So what that means is that people will be able to — ML: (Laughs) TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. 
(Laughter) Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic? 
(Laughter) CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now. 
(Laughter) And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods, and pain that went up and pain that went down, and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain. 
It was magic healers and aromatic oils. 
I come back up, not for air. 
And the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas. 
So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. 
Next step in my process. 
But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life. 
And when human beings began moving objects around like this, it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. 
HC: So the key thing to remember here is, we don't really care what this tuna really is. 
Again, this is no mere hypothetical. 
This is the first voice they've created for an individual. 
And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. 
Now wall switches, we all know, fail. 
And I'd say, "I don't believe that." 
Our economy was based on commodities, so the price of cotton or the price of wheat, and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. 
(Applause) No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller, has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three, and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective. 
And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal. 
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. 
Has it done any good? 
(Applause) I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. 
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York, and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment. 
Well, what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets, the coverage rate really falls down a lot. 
There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ... 
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out, okay? 
Of course, this is a long road. 
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them. 
He was going to be dead by the age of 25. 
Design was just a part of the process. 
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? 
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months. (Laughter) People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. 
But that is no way to survive. 
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. 
You can pinch into any page. 
So for women, housework prevents breast cancer, but for men, shopping could make you impotent. 
So, what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals? 
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. 
So ultimately, I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway. 
He would say we are equal. 
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week, get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed. 
We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs. 
And these are not esoteric limits. 
64 multiplied by 75. 
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning. 
All of these would have been great things to do, and my nurses had no idea. 
We chart it, we've described it, we've drawn it, we've mapped it. 
We can see tendons and muscles. 
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. 
We should not underestimate it. 
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure. 
Some of it ran off as flooding, but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again, exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. 
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated, passionate service to them. 
And I say to Tony, "Let's do this." 
And it will take all of you. 
I believe matter begets life; life becomes single cells; single cells become strings; strings become chains; chains network. 
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine. 
I was a noticeable nobody. 
Crazy, I know. Insane. 
So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. 
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone. 
And then there's the stigma. 
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology. 
So there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world, and what you see is more of a defensive, rigid, reactionary strain, which led to Arab socialism, Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. 
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. 
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz, it's two. 
Not me, that was for sure. 
(Applause) I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. 
In our accelerated media culture, desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. 
And the last one is support. 
Five years ago, for instance, I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle to what I knew was an impossible question: What actually happened one desert night, half the world and almost half of history away? 
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now." 
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange, and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity, his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language. 
Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste, that you like certain things. 
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. 
Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo, London or New York. 
And he asked me how I had made the house for those wasps, because he had never seen one this big. 
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider. 
And that's why actually in the 19th century the Ottoman Empire, which then covered the whole Middle East, made very important reforms -- reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status, accepting a constitution, accepting a representative parliament, advancing the idea of freedom of religion. 
This little girl was interesting; she ate the inside of the marshmallow. 
Here are some images from the film. 
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence, which is that the system starts to do things, which it was never designed for. 
Think about the Dalai Lama. 
We also have transgenesis. 
It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir, not a bad debut at all. 
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man. 
How do we know that? 
And these systems are being tested right now, and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. 
And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. 
Our typical video is two minutes, sometimes shorter, never more than six, and then we pause for a quiz question, to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring. 
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. 
So again, you have to do some detective work here. 
Saving more today is not an option. 
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. 
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. 
What would they tell us? 
We self-edit as we’re having ideas. 
It wasn't my highlight of 2012. 
There's one more part to the story. 
I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures. 
Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas. 
When you walk across landscapes, it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. 
Unfortunately, many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces. 
It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks. 
It will make you immortal. 
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. 
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper? 
And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. 
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. 
And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. 
People started contributing ideas. 
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all, but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family, my kids. 
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search. 
What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings. 
Playful exploration, playful building and role-play: those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work. 
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent. 
But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it. 
It now makes sense to go back in, build a deck and build up on those sites. 
We've done that already." 
Well, not as big as his, but fairly big. 
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap. 
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps. 
They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime. 
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. 
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. 
I do not think about what I consider to be peace, which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. 
I asked a question last year: Can art change the world? 
So we have here, this couple. 
One out of 10 are saving enough. 
What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle, and everything matches up. 
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer. 
I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough. 
I was speaking too loudly. 
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. 
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers, broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers, bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men, your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters. 
who I've got over. 
I said, take care of them. 
(Laughter) So to bring on more co-developers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems. 
However, if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan, and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today, you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. 
I love stories. I want to read." 
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich. 
And second, teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools, because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. 
But one thing is for sure, the Great Divergence is over, folks. 
Thanks. 
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems. 
So we don't have to worry about our products being sold, for example, for less money in places that are poor, and then they get re-imported into the U.S. -- for example, with the drug industry. 
I said, "Where is he now?" 
It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on. 
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day. 
For example, did they ask their students challenging questions? 
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren't going to take off. 
But again, a little diversion to the topic of organ donation. 
They would have spent the time alone, all that time. 
Iceland went through this financial crisis. 
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it. 
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have. 
Can you imagine saying that? 
Ahh! We come upon them, the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out. 
Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen. 
If version 10 is coming out next week, there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine. 
Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. 
Together, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter. 
Voice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil. 
I think this is a revolution. 
They were doing fine. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. 
And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream. 
"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school? 
It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults. (Laughter) BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers. 
In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed. 
And she -- just the look on her face came over and she said -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right? 
We want to play you one more selection. 
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools. 
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime. 
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?" 
So drink your wine blind in the future. 
She's been suffering for years. 
What was difficult was to get them to imagine: so, imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine. 
So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives. 
WAIS Divide itself though, is a circle of tents in the snow. 
Does your work relate to his? 
You get a mouth. 
You are ready? 
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay, a physicist in England, and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things, he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic." 
I'm even more of a fan of globalization. 
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them. 
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand. 
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. 
And it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's racked with famine and drought. 
We then got to the last ancestor. 
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture, to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in? 
Thank you. 
They have trouble relating to other people. 
And this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. 
Think about that. 
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. 
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. 
And this was "Scared." 
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. 
And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES -- Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. 
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years? 
It was time to push what I called MAPS 3. 
It's an interaction between volunteers, passionate inventors and technology, and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. 
And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together, and in the process it has some byproducts, and I utilize those byproducts. 
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962. 
I was like, "Woohoo! I'm going to travel." 
This is the control condition. This is what they memorized. 
Okay, so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing, because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool. 
I thought about her and those who worked with her on the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948, and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. 
You're certain that you possess the Truth -- inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T -- and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness, by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride in being so very right, in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism. 
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment? 
In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, "Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again." 
But 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development, and this is particularly true for young babies. 
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. 
Our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average, and during that five year dotcom bust, we tripled in size. 
The kids got the pills, and then their performance improved. 
And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying, and it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time. 
That people on the fringes can find each other, connect and go somewhere. 
Are you trustworthy? 
Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans. 
They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. 
All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. 
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings, this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways. 
And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression, moderate and severe. 
And I said, "Of course it is." 
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. 
(Applause) The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us. 
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome. 
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific. 
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week. 
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you, there's an even more valuable application than that. 
What do you think they're feeling? 
On April 26, 2010, President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the Muslim world -- the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out to the Justice League of America. 
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple: Block and clone.

To really understand Central Park, you have to physically be there. 
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India, it was the party of a Hindu God. 
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth. 
But when I realized that the non-Muslim, or the non-Islamic-minded actors in the same geography, sometimes behaved similarly, I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region, not just Islam. 
And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine, the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. 
So this is something you have to recognize. 
(Laughter) So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production. 
Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1, 21 digits long, was not prime. 
It feels less positive, less optimistic, to talk about how the pie is sliced than to think about how to make the pie bigger. 
It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins, making the right side of the heart work overtime, and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect. 
At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001, there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York -- commuters spilling off trains, waitresses setting tables for the morning rush, brokers already working the phones on Wall Street. 
In other words, it's kind of random, kind of ad hoc, how we figure out what we should do. 
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. 
Chris. 
It was the fact she was going so slow. 
It doesn't matter what the calculations are. 
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation. 
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this, in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq -- and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea. 
Because if you think about it, 1,000 TEDTalks, that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading. 
So as I said, we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it. 
And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else, and focus our energy on that. 
We get that from the census data. 
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. 
So even though I didn't grow any taller, I didn't sprout a beard, something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed. 
Remember, I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs. 
In fact, I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers. 
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. 
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming, my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it. 
But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls. 
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid. 
In our very unequal world today, it's very striking how many people are left behind. 
What has happened in the last 15 years with this work? 
In real wonder, two years later, I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars. 
Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo, there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild. 
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. 
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging. 
They weren't quite slick enough. 
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 
And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone. 
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky! 
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule, Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism. 
Most of them should be in orbit around something. 
And finally, there's the old way of viewing food is the old way. 
Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister. 
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet. 
(Music) Man 10: It's beautiful. 
But all of these attempts have one thing in common. 
I've tried this in many, many schools. 
There are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live. 
We're at the ocean. 
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people. 
Is there a frontier for us of how we live together? 
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the Internet, even. 
Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. 
Nobody knows where they are. 
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. 
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. 
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks. 
I don't think it looks like us. 
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn, Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system, so if I just keep letting this go, you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that. 
Guys, we've learned from you today. 
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin? 
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down." 
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture. 
Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. 
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. 
Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. 
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. 
It had become trendy to speak about the "obesity epidemic." 
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not. 
The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible. 
Can we have the next video, quickly? 
What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves. 
Thank you. 
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. 
And all of that stuff is really disgusting, but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems. 
He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home. 
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. 
But you find essentially the same results, namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level -- increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. 
But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. 
And the answer is no. 
So they're the brains of maker projects, and here's an example of one. 
For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds. 
I think it depends on the observer. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, what is there to be done? 
That has been the most exciting thing, not the technology, not the things people have done with it, but actually the community, the spirit of all these people getting together, sending the emails. 
You've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones. 
If you know how to pray, pray. 
Between 1950 and 2000, the region grows by 30 percent. 
Didn't make sense to me. 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) Even cats were watching this video. 
You must be out of your mind." 
You have to have a dignity of labor. 
Two months later, something incredible happens. 
We really could think of flu, then, as just a bad cold. 
The rest of it is the bedside console; just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- I mean, really until now. 
But this is not ground water. 
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus. 
We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers, Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots, Islam by suicide bombers. 
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. 
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different. 
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. 
In the next mode, Rezero is passive, and we can move him around. 
And so with all these crises, we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation. 
And Woody's was to do what was best for his child. 
They took him -- I think it was for his birthday -- they took him for lunch. 
Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. 
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. 
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004. 
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for. 
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. 
Now look again at this. 
Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. 
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you, it's extraordinary what happens. 
And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. 
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately. 
Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. 
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor. 
I don't know if you've heard of this. 
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. 
They have increased the security of proprietors. 
(Laughter) But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. 
This is DNA in its classic double helix form. 
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. 
And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight, teaching other people how to fly, just under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward. 
Their burn-up is much higher. 
We tend to look at the world, not as the integrated system that it is, but as a series of individual issues. 
And some people will fund their entire Lego habit by selling the little guy, but then you have no guys in your ships. 
We belong to the family called the Hominidae. 
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that, real LED stuff, 21st-century technology. 
And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area. 
But here's the key thing: you know, the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold, that the planet warmed up enough -- and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade -- the planet warmed up enough that it became ... 
Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. 
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it's not just that the money is wasted -- that's the least of the problems -- it's that the money is captured. 
He gives half of them vitamin B12. 
And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page, you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide, all right? 
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned. 
It's really a question of scale. 
Say, "By the way, that guy's a crappy employee." 
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. 
But imagine if my genome were deidentified, sitting in software, and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there, and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations. 
And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way, where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. 
That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading, and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands; they can save lives. 
And to connect our country after World War II, we didn't build more two-lane highways, we built the interstate highway system. 
Then, on the side, we've got the Web and, increasingly, the cloud, which is fantastic, but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction. 
No, better yet, a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind. 
It has to totally surrender, as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. 
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. 
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across. 
Short shadows at noon and so forth. 
I tried to emulate him, but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes." 
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners, most come with a lot of handicaps, most are homeless and many are in foster care. 
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand. 
We worked well into each night. 
I decided to cross during the day, first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark, second because I knew I was already taking a risk, and since not many people tried to cross during the day, I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone. 
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being. 
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime. 
But then in the field of mathematics, as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED, the age of the computer goes along and things explode. 
A couple of examples. 
And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. 
So three important ones that I can think of are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence. 
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953. 
But, if the merit idea was true, why would identical resumes, in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale, identical resumes sent out for a lab technician, why would Jennifers be deemed less competent, be less likely to be offered the job, and be paid less than Johns. 
We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. 
For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future. 
You know of "The March of the Penguins." 
I was in high school and got a bad grade, a rare event for me, so I decided to hide it from my parents. 
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved. 
(Audience: Yes.) Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!) CP: Okay. 
This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here. 
I'm like, screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond. 
Through reclamation of our narrative, we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. 
So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. 
The old, sadly, we will die. 
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. 
You know, how on earth did they know all this? 
Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick? 
That's what makes the difference between North America and South America. 
We should be marching towards a global society. 
It was about all children. So, we were shameless. 
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall. 
(Laughter) Because there seems to be an issue. 
You could regain this time. 
So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. 
He said, "Well what are you doing?" 
He wants to get your cookies. 
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. 
Because the northeastern trade winds, as they go over the Amazonas, effectively gather the water vapor. 
He was cool. He was fine. 
But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. 
But I don't think that's right. 
The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years. 
The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate is all much the same. 
They are the happiest place. 
Wonderful. 
And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me. 
It would be a big seller. 
In essence, dancers were challenging each other online to get better; incredible new dance skills were being invented; even the six-year-olds were joining in. 
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop. 
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher. 
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. 
Not very sustainable. 
And speaking of values, I've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online, and when I'm talking with people, more often than not there is a weird bias. 
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847. 
And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. 
So before I talk about what is, I think, the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi, I want to talk about their shared source. 
Because now that media is increasingly social, innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. 
It's now an issue for faith-based organizations, under very good leadership from Pope Francis, and indeed, the Church of England, which is divesting from fossil fuels. 
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this. 
So take a look around this auditorium today. 
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas, knowledge, content, designs and product. 
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together. 
(Applause) This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. 
When it comes time to do the actual problem set, we have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit. 
Now it's exploded. 
This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important, more powerful than ever before, and are going to increase growth more than ever before. 
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making, and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before, I'm also sure that technology will advance, and therefore living standards will advance. 
Man: Now blink right to go right. 
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. 
But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro. 
But we break it down to some basic realities. 
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day. 
And, finally, compare nodes C and D: C and D both have six friends. 
We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids. 
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration. 
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. 
And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities. 
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds. 
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister, and something that we hadn't really thought of before. 
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. 
You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer. 
That is, you can stack them. 
In the 1700s, other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all. 
Now, this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years. 
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve? 
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. 
Where had that water gone? 
Like I'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no to me, especially if you have two options -- you have the brown one or the clear one. 
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure. 
They have what we want. 
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. 
They can be a little skeptical; I’ll come back to that. 
And if you had an injured organ, if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area, do you want those robust, plentiful stem cells on the top? 
Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. 
I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird. 
♫ Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh ♫ ♫ If you'd ever been out walking you would know ♫ (Applause) Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much. The show's not over. 
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society. 
Choir: ♫ I'm hooked on a feelin' ♫ ♫ I'm high on believin' ♫ ♫ That you're in love with me ♫ DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. 
I am a conductor, and I'm here today to talk to you about trust. 
A few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab. 
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?" 
I have to take a moment. 
(Laughter) And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it, I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. 
It was the opposite of what was expected. 
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. 
And the fax said, there should be songs, there should be an "I want" song, there should be a happy village song, there should be a love story and there should be a villain. 
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week. 
We created public education. 
How does this help us understand? 
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. 
And it's a beautifully complex neuron. 
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke. 
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy. 
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing, difficult situation into a fun game. 
You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it. 
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island. 
Relatively sparse number of producers. 
"The writing on the wall" is part of our everyday language. 
You can burst bubbles. 
And all this at a time when the population has doubled. 
This is why they did not accept. 
You need efforts to supplement schools. 
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes: Marshall McLuhan said, "Children are the messages that we send to the future," but in fact, if you think of it, children are the future we send to the future. 
Remember fire? 
And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about, but it even corrupts our own society. 
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. 
I'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we're living in a pluralist society. 
This is our star. This is our Sun. 
If you get a bubble in your medicine -- because you have to mix it every morning -- and it stays in there, you probably die. 
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. 
Maybe we have something to learn as well. 
I've become the crazy wrongness lady. 
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person." 
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. 
(Laughter) There is so many things that -- Light. 
We're also born pleasure-seekers. 
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. 
So I brought back the rabbit, the dragonfly, to stay in that street. 
None of them are taught in cooking schools. 
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. 
I was so wasted." 
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories, never by statistics and strategies. 
The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. 
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays. 
It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. 
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true. 
We need that in the world. 
They're a bit subversive in what they do. 
And for us young people, they're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves. 
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice. 
As you can see, the bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from. 
(Video) English Mother: Ah, I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice. 
And those resources are going away. 
It'll be built into architecture. 
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise, surrounding us all the time. 
And today, architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us. 
You see that really salty Play-Doh? 
Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more. 
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi, an actual physical space where we could collaborate, and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya. 
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. 
D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend? 
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. 
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating. 
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite. 
Companies can even give control to hackers. 
So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University, I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career. 
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe, which makes up 23 percent of the universe, and something called dark energy, which permeates the fabric of space-time, that makes up another 73 percent. 
The water's stiff. 
He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a "professional," he does not have to cut out his emotions, he has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy. 
Thank you. 
In the middle of my traveling, I turned 40 and I began to hate my body, which was actually progress, because at least my body existed enough to hate it. 
(Laughter) "China seems to have been long stationary, and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. 
It's around 1900. 
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand. 
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it. 
No, that is not me. 
Now, notice, something interesting -- Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. 
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. 
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. 
So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral. 
There is only one solution. It's not that hard. 
So then you realize there are these conventions. 
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states, as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions. 
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics, we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. 
And you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now. 
And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls, now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women. 
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. 
But moving to our fourth commandment, I really wouldn't be here tonight. 
You have build something very fascinating, and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it. 
People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating, but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone. 
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly. 
My predecessor meant that. 
And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them. 
This is called a figure-ground illusion. 
It has to go all over the world: through fibers, through satellites, through all kinds of connections. 
And so Palestinians guys say, "Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution." 
Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying, from the past, okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. 
And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video. 
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. 
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers just got one word of feedback: Satisfactory. 
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. 
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control. 
The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. 
Let's see. Yeah, it worked. 
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. 
But apparently that was not an issue at the time. 
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this. 
Much is to be gained by eBooks: ease, convenience, portability. 
And the translations of the surviving texts say, "This I will not treat. This I cannot treat." 
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well. 
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now. 
Since we had never been separated, and I thought we would be together forever, I didn't even give her a hug when she left. 
But it's not just about dollars and impressions. 
(Clapping) (Clapping) Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three? 
Look at the health systems in so many countries. 
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. 
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer in this huge, very exciting lab, lots of people coming from all over the world. 
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade. 
MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic. 
I just wanted to say that I miss you, and I love you, and please come back to me and stay alive. 
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. 
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change. 
I get the meat sweats. 
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA. 
In other words, we're not literally replacing the components of the retina. 
But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point, OK. 
You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. 
Teacher: Well done. Very good ... 
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that." 
Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. 
And I knocked on the door. 
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world. 
They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys, rodents -- anything they can, really. 
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme. 
In this way, their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces, with the parks, with the greenways, with the busways. 
And you know, from an exploration perspective, this behavior makes complete sense. 
At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile, I installed one for my daughter. 
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather. 
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet. 
Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the -- excuse me, it's fairly blatant -- is really not the approach that we need to take. 
Yet it would do very little good. 
(Laughter) Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars, cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance. 
(Laughter) This was a fun one.

And from that much contact with politicians, I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. 
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints -- importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it -- and we take them underwater. 
Here's how the song goes. 
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes. 
And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says, "What are those?" 
It's just an incredible device. 
Is everything okay? 
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock. 
Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this. 
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. 
This is something called funnel plot. 
And our team members developed this technology. 
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. 
And I had this captured market. You didn't need contracts. 
(Applause) I'm going to talk today about saving more, but not today, tomorrow.

You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair, pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. 
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals. 
Before the light bulb was invented, people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, focus it a little bit; put lenses in front of it, focus it a little bit better.

She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter) Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her for the new year, said, "It doesn't look like it's worth that much." 
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you? 
There's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud. 
They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán against organized crime. 
That is the resource that I'm talking about. 
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give, it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring, even a chocolate, I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it. 
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. 
Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over. 
Just fold up the wings and keep going. 
So, as you all know, species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments, and the pressures of those environments selected which changes, through random mutation in species, were going to be preserved. 
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York. 
And today, cyclists look like New York City looks. 
A photo is not enough." 
By the third sentence, she was in tears. 
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. 
Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car. 
There are also financial reforms in rural China. 
And how you think about what you're experiencing, your beliefs about the essence of it, affect how it hurts.

You can tickle the rug. 
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. 
It does concern you, as well.

I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over, that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. 
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily, because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically. 
And his pictures, everything's accurate and it's all to scale. 
And they got here in the late 1960s. 
The same is again true with information. 
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong. 
And we have the elves in the form of China. 
And so I thought, "Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system -- not one like this one, but one like this one -- because, functionally, a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces. 
So they tell you where it is, what the prices are, the address, the phone number, etc. 
And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about "disappear." 
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend. 
And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive. 
For example, all the courageous TEDTalks: "People dying," or "People suffering," was also one, "with easy solutions around." 
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. 
It varies a bit province to province. 
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico, which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic. 
Students watched the videos on their own, and then they come together to discuss them. 
Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long used to darken the sun. 
And you can see on the screen a cell being made. 
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. 
Align it in this direction. 
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. 
Most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900. 
There are countries up here which are very poor. 
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. 
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller, is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically. 
That means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. 
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals, but -- (Laughter) they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons. 
And you spend a third of your life in bed. 
(Laughter) They tend to eat a plant-based diet. 
When we look for information online, we basically have two strategies. 
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. 
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. 
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction, you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen. 
So this is my kid. This is Maezza, and when she was seven years old, she came home from school one day, and like I do every single day, I asked her, "What'd you do today?" 
And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to -- Not the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait -- But around that dining table in the officer's saloon, I was sitting next to a Burmese guy, I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian. 
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up. 
And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. 
For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. 
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for. 
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play. 
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees. 
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play. 
We are primates, so the correct comparison is to other primates. 
But I was enraptured, and in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea. 
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree. 
And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, "This is a good seal, ya. 
(Video) Mos Def: ♫ ... brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be ♫ ♫ Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity ♫ ♫ Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry ♫ ♫ Go and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically ♫ ♫ Ain't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be ♫ ♫ Styled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three ♫ ♫ When I say when I be, girls say bend that key cut ♫ CL: And so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz. 
And with that question, I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there's more coming -- (Laughter) — sanitation, toilets and poop, and I have yet to emerge. 
What happens when people pursue money too avidly, is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life. 
And we make the machine meet them half way. 
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range, you go into disease or death. 
Water is the key ingredient in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet. 
(Laughter) We can't sit idly by here either. 
Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. 
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. 
And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. 
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. 
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man. 
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas. 
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. 
(Video) Boy: How about this? 
It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. 
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. 
So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope. 
I collected my findings in a book, placed them chronologically, stating the name, the patron, the medium and the date. 
My challenge instead is this. 
Nature, city. Nothing changes. 
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. 
Child: When I watch TV, it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend, and when you explore, you get more imagination than you already had, and when you get more imagination, it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things, like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach, or something, and it could be beautiful. 
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) I'm standing in front of you today in all humility, wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. 
That means 91 percent, even after the census, still remain to be discovered. 
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun. 
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project. 
But on my left retina there is a bump, which is marked there by the red arrow. 
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. 
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus, I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings, the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. 
So using the supercharged attention from step one, we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. 
This is how it looks. 
Let me start again. 
These women and those young men united Iranians across the world, inside and outside. 
But how meaningful is this calculation, really? 
And, you know, thank you. 
These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized. 
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles. 
But I believe now that we're moving into a new age, and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as "the age of behavior." 
And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters, it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions, to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment, and we can do that with the best passive design, but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun. 
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. 
(Laughter). 
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world, operated by the Japanese government. 
(Applause) So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea. 
(Laughter) This was a huge criticism that we got to say, if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid. 
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable? -- if we can answer that, then we're going to know how special biology is, and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some idea of what life really is. 
India, starting a little bit later, but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth. 
And you can see the cartoon here. 
And the question is: will it make a difference? 
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer, the easiest answer, of course, is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. 
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. 
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you? 
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee, we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry, and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. 
We're people, and we have problems. 
We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong. 
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages?" 
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere. 
And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. 
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. 
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer. 
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. 
Because the killer apps can be downloaded. 
It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. 
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. 
One is fully passive, like I just described -- as in, for instance, the trucker example, where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. 
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that. 
Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country. 
If I really want the music to go there, the best way for me to do it is to listen. 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really. 
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash, and commitment to preventing HIV too. 
Usually it's one or two a year. 
So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did. 
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with, and we actually got to do it twice. 
This is the opposite; this is how we make things. 
Beer is basically liquid bread, or bread is solid beer. 
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists. 
He asked the PGA, the Professional Golfers' Association, for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments. 
We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away from here, and you wouldn't mind too much, but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. 
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species, take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences, which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process. 
And let me show you a simple example. 
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it. 
They could have destroyed this little thing right here from 25,000 ft. 
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier. 
Basically, I celebrated every religious function. 
But it's not all about the seafood. 
Dana: There's too much darkness. 
We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine radiating outwards from the Middle East. 
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. 
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. 
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. 
The Philippines didn't succeed. 
And the hospital and GE were happy too. 
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse. 
They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins. 
Two years later, he was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
I was very much inspired by this image many years ago, and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world. 
Thank you. 
And not only that, but when they came into these countries, then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia, where, for the first time in over a decade last year, children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. 
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. 
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC. 
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo, and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. 
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive." 
And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. 
But if you saw this protocell, you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. 
Never seen Sweden. 
Basically a restaurant just like any other. 
One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish. 
Forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it. 
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know. 
You can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here. 
(Music) ♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ (Applause) All right. 
He's like, "You idiot. You moron. 
2015 is a year that is similar in its importance to 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential. 
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider, with the possibility to fly cross-country, distance, just with the use of thermals to soar. 
For example, it stimulates creativity. 
Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good? 
I guess we could make a glow chicken. 
You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions, it's fact, and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish. 
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. 
It turns things on and off, but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time. 
I'm devoting my career to that. 
Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. 
John Hunter: I offered them a -- (Applause) Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. 
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this? 
This is a world in which there's no electricity, there's no money, there's no medical competence. 
But the next step is called "universal responsibility." 
You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it? 
In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid, Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. 
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face. 
Now most of you are probably saying, well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion. 
And everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate, and the only way that's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements, also called transfer payments. 
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet. 
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. 
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself as extreme. 
And for sure, in our case, our work started to look the same. 
To grow leather, we begin by taking cells from an animal, through a simple biopsy. 
I don't know. 
So no other device has been able to do this. 
We have Olympic-caliber events coming to Oklahoma City, and athletes from all over the world moving in, along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. 
It seems mad to talk about nothing. 
This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. 
Choir: ♫ When you hold me in your arms ♫ DD: This is all computer-controlled in an old Volvo. 
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts. 
If you've been in the American West, you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous, but that being said, you see that this has this unique, circular form. 
And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one. 
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize. 
The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything, because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution. 
Because simple answers may emerge. 
So what can we do about this? 
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio, she wants a washing machine. 
Let's turn the world inside out together. 
But this isn't the really interesting stuff. 
And if you're not an American citizen, you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. 
Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other, who are not fighting. 
Well to start to do this, we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. 
You are Noora the Light. 
And they all treat learning, not as some sort of academic, analytical activity, but as that's something that's productive, something you make, something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from. 
In the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War, the U.S. military, the air force, sent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. 
It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth. 
I think it's fair to say -- (Applause) -- it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike, and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. 
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. 
So our first prototypes we built were huge. 
So research has shown, if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here, in education. 
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. 
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. 
So you could feel good about selling it. 
That's because an egg is not a closed system; it comes out of a chicken. 
Coming in closer, picking up Earth, orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth. 
If this is the only film that I ever make, I'm going to document until this becomes a reality." 
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road, and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice. 
Einstein: [Coughs] SW: Yeah. 
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. 
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise, because there's unique fingerprint, we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. 
He electrifies only the outside. 
I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish, in my tiny capacity, of little African girls -- the wish of being educated. 
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps -- migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier. 
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple. 
And finally the Chinese cracked down. 
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a -- I think it's going to be very, very useful. 
So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life. 
That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for -- to understand particles. 
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. 
But he was the second child, and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter) So he wandered in, and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling, and I don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it. 
And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. 
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful. 
The next slide I'm about to show you, is a little more serious. 
And I recoiled. They stank! 
Why not personal biotech? 
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata. 
And yes, my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds. 
I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. 
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again. 
But in the last 10 years, bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. 
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. 
Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations. 
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. 
Now the main bad guy, Rughal, does not want these stones to update, so he's trying to get them to stop updating. 
And it was time for us to put oxygen in. 
These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place. 
One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently. 
And then and only then, we throw down that mathematical structure. 
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts. How would they do this to their little kids?" 
The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. 
Eventually, the new model will replace the old model. 
Many of you will know the story. 
To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. 
We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork. 
So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource-constrained environment -- and in that sense, very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years, next few decades. 
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles." 
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. 
Do you go to a restaurant? 
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake, but it's impossible to fly over, so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country, to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes. 
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo. 
Now, millions of abalone every year make this shell. 
Are they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy. 
There were still fishes. 
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from." 
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.) -- and I was there with a catcher's mitt. 
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule. 
Where is the soldier in each son? 
(Laughter) And I barely finished elementary school. 
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. 
And a social movement is comprised, in my view, it's comprised of four main characteristics. 
We should retain those people. 
(Applause) I became an inventor by accident. 
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects, hire teachers, school meals, school uniforms, scholarships. 
They had a concept of blue blood. 
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. 
You felt the empathy for that child. 
So on December 4th, I went here. 
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!" 
All right, why would we see this correlation? 
But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is -- that this diversity is being lost. 
There's no American compassion. 
We can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed. 
Is that conceivable? 
The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. 
In other words, to keep operating at our current level, we need 50 percent more Earth than we've got. 
Because this one. I think there were a few here. 
You could count them in five minutes. 
We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar. 
Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn. 
Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street? 
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time, you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. 
But, hey. 
(Applause) Many times I go around the world to speak, and people ask me questions about the challenges, my moments, some of my regrets. 
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. 
And it's very common that we compare India with China. 
And I practiced my walking as much as I could, and I went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where I could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn't too far apart. 
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. 
It's actually a bay. 
(Applause) A tourist is backpacking through the highlands of Scotland, and he stops at a pub to get a drink. 
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. 
But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species. 
Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher. 
I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information. 
And I remember another bloke telling me that I should eat all the yogurt I could because that was the only culture I was going to get around there. 
So this non-lethal weapon was being used, in fact, in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation. 
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common. 
So how do we do this? Well, we use a model system that we term a protocell. 
And you're reading this website. 
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us. 
(Laughter) You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out. 
'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born. 
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago. 
There's no major difference between these religions. 
I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another. 
They are believed to have magical powers. 
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. 
So my process is very straightforward. 
The green line is the number of bike lanes. 
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight. 
It's not hardware. 
One of their mothers said to us, "You know, we can't survive here, but we can't even seem to die either." 
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. 
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in. 
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. 
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life, chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until, you know, I can't record them anymore. 
Why is this? I used medical college girls. 
And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place. 
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. 
I wanted to know what that would take, so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway to find the answer. 
In this image of the Tokyo skyline, I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block, the Kepler Mission. 
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. 
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two, you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors, patients, commissioners of health services, and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature. 
Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? -- When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen. 
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. 
I can only have faith in it, commit myself, that is, to the idea of it, and I do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence. 
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things. 
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining? 
(Applause) So that's kind of our battle cry. 
This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. 
T, E, D. 
To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica." 
But whoever it is, I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like, "Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh! 
I had no practical skills. 
At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much. 
The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. 
It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds. 
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949. 
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. 
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual, simultaneously. 
Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining, and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates, and get out of our own way in other ways. 
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE, which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. 
I had Jewish bibles. 
Let me show you a couple of examples here. 
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina, diseases like macular degeneration, and there's little that can be done for them. 
And it's about loving people really well. 
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing." 
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios, but sometimes big studios borrowing back. 
And here begins 400 years of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams -- the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno, many others -- which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time. 
Fragile democracies is the beige color. 
Many of them didn't want to bribe. 
And I didn't know what I was going to discover, so I couldn't get the funding for this. 
All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we're all made of -- and that's four percent of the universe. 
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. 
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. 
And during harvest, put it back with interest, food interest. 
And the second thing is confidence, that we can see how game-playing and reward structures make people braver, make them more willing to take risks, more willing to take on difficulty, harder to discourage. 
We all love stories. 
Of course, we can't know what's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty. 
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick. 
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment. 
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.) So I decided, kind of told myself, "Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter) Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers. 
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. 
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street. 
And we feed them -- sterilely of course -- with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food -- and we grow them in incubators. 
Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers, you understand that's a very high bar. 
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. 
So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this. 
So it was absolutely gigantic. 
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. 
So, in soap, fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent, but also for giving it a pearl-like effect. 
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius, neurologically, and I think, with these methods, we're getting close to being there. 
And people were like, "We knew they were vicious. We knew they were." 
So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole. 
So, first, it's mostly invisible; second, it's huge; and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing. 
And if he says, "Well, what? how?" 
Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution. 
And stage 11, we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away. 
You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car. 
CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments. 
This is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes. 
Additionally, it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing. 
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. 
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. 
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures. 
And so I've stopped using words like "form," and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer. 
How many here favor the first policy: the state should recognize traditional marriage only? 
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated. 
That's the whole idea. 
No other evidence. 
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. 
(Applause) For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy, and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk. 
It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. 
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject. 
In each little drop of water you get 50 billion of these guys. 
You also have the mathematical structure, talking about grids, measurements, labels, points, axes, that sort of thing. 
(Laughter) But most importantly, what they have done in Japan, which I find so inspirational, is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door. 
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do, and energy? 
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. 
But you know, these stories, and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest, basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me. 
And finally, you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways. 
And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness" of the child's mind. 
And from day to day, we have the techniques that we use. 
The politics become easier as the decade progresses if you're building on a foundation of security and economic development -- the rebuilding of prosperity. 
We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many. 
As a body architect, I've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want. 
And it works the exact same way. 
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. 
Whereas in India, you cannot do that, because you have to listen to the public. 
I love that term: guided mastery. 
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube? 
Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. 
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Natural-watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature, and using dehumidified air to create comfort. 
You can look at it online. 
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut. 
So this scavenger comes in, which is a giant sixgill shark. 
D: Good to have you with us, Brent. 
The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night. 
And it really informs my painting. 
So our patients are women and children. 
This is why I'm launching a new initiative. 
So it does play a social role, however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement. 
It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn. 
What does that mean? 
But they actually create our reality in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. 
And then, in fact, these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships: marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties. 
We have to get to this. 
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. 
But it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is, to have an undefended heart. 
Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. 
Tell that guy to wait half an hour. 
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. 
So my artwork is about identity and language, challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from, gender, race, class. 
(Applause) DH: So since we started this project, we've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls from people from all around the world. 
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. 
As a homework assignment, think of 10 ways to get around it. 
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you. 
You wouldn't paint with syringes, but it works just the same. 
I don't think what you did was right. 
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all? 
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen, the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott. 
Environmental consideration was served with every plate, but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. 
Check out this image above the orange line in Boston. 
I said, "Chicken pellets?" 
I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. 
And you'll need to attract families, the residents who will come and live there permanently, raise their children, get an education for their children, and get their first job. 
(Laughter) And so we didn't build any models, and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. 
These regimes created something within us during this period. 
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.

Then what happens is the retinal circuitry, the middle part, goes to work on it, and what it does is it performs operations on it, it extracts information from it, and it converts that information into a code. 
And this is what runs our infrastructure. 
But really, every measurement it makes is precious, because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets, and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe. 
And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.

So that's what we are planning to do. 
So, I've been really lucky as an inventor. 
So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. 
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts. 
They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma, and we developed concepts of collective action, basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table, explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing, and to make a long story short, we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. 
Let's start with why this is important. 
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [unclear] by doing things differently. 
But they are networks, and the most important network of cities is you. 
We launched two titles in October -- "Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate, which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?" 
We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world. 
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. 
Publication bias affects every field of medicine. 
The purpose of this project is, one: I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past. 
But China also has a great firewall. 
Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers. 
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. 
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person. 
(Applause) (Children singing) Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai. 
It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements, it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to, say, reproduce and evolve. 
And they will step up. 
And I promise you, if you take that walk inside Google Streetview, you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. 
Please raise your hand -- oh, that's a lot. 
Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners. 
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees. 
Well, this has deep implications about the limits of science, about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies, about intelligence in the universe, about questions like free will and about creating technology. 
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and, I would say, nakedness, that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. 
We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.

MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. 
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy, but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. 
Well, who else would be in the house?

I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design. 
This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn. 
And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make. 
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. 
(Laughter) Now we have to counter that, though, against the evidence we've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans. 
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.

One is the question of education. 
The question was, where from? 
So I start with immunization. 
And then they morph into violent extremism. 
So if we all take only what we need, then we can begin to share the rest, we can begin to celebrate, we can begin to restore. 
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. 
So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the in-vitro meat habitat, or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. 
And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid.

Japan here was regarded as an exception. 
It doesn't matter what your religion is; even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know, "Make sure you lie three times a day."

This is a real rural village. 
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal. 
It was very hard at first. 
I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. 
And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations. 
How do we live it successfully? 
(Clanging) (Buzzing) A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something." 
And also, space is incredibly vast. 
They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot. 
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe, but this is available in India. 
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. 
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally, people are communicating on a regular basis with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere. 
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions. 
Hasn't changed that much. 
And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed. 
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is. 
We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger. 
And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity.

We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals. 
Once you start down at this very humble level, then you can start finding ways to see things.

It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. 
When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves. 
With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. 
Why do we have them? Well, as I said, we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. 
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is." 
Let me tell you what I've come up with. 
I mean, it's not easy; you see a lot of poverty. 
A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them, and it's difficult, because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program.

And here is the twentieth century answer. 
So, take a look. 
The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it, simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing. 
Central among them are three. 
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- "What is a scalable model?" -- as if the need of a community, which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places, has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale. 
That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot, send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.

So, yeah. 
Dangerous troublemaker. 
Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.

That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel. 
Susan Boyle. 
Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed, with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. 
So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. 
(Laughter) I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell, and this was the very latest one. 
(Video) ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ ♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫ ♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫ ♫ And somehow I get over it ♫ ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ ♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ ♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ Okay, so I wrote that song, right.

I realized I couldn't survive much longer this way. 
And so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder, and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. 
So to invoke another metaphor, if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned American quilt, and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches. 
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time. 
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. 
We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria. 
And it's a system with very high turnover. 
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.

And on the first day at Simikot in Humla, far west of Nepal, the most impoverished region of Nepal, an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. 
There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. 
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology, like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. 
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using, divided between two floors. 
But also the non-Muslim communities of North Africa -- the Animists, even some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa is known to practice female circumcision.

DNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny. 
The message reads, [Arabic] "You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring." 
The big trials are closer to the true answer. 
The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. 
And this is the tower from below. 
It's quite a familiar story. 
I made more money. 
We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel, or two-foundation morality. 
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter. 
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. 
There's a nobility of real, hands-on, dirt-under-your-fingernails work. 
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data. 
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. 
And the gut is a silent voice -- it's going more for feelings.

That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground, entirely. 
It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before. 
Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime. 
So, if we want to track something that was spreading through a network, what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network, including node A, monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network, and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. 
There's a lot more to come. 
But these surveys are costly, so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.

So to give you an idea of what that's like, I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle, and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. 
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. 
They did not share the same anti-colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region. 
But people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything! 
You could literally, I mean this, pass this particular unit without knowing any physics, just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. 
And it actually means sad. 
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. 
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up. 
But just go to the Web, YouTube, pull it down, "folding T-shirt." 
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers, camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs. 
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere, because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend. 
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side. 
And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease for 50 years. 
But what politicians need is a range of options. 
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes. 
(Laughter) They did that, and watch a little bit of this. 
So the idea of a mistake: From the perspective of a jazz musician, it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.

So it's a lot of vacancy. 
And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities, not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, what have you, but here at home as well. 
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front! 
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons. 
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide. 
There was amazing improvements.

Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. 
Let's look at some results. 
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down. 
And then there's improvising on a scale -- quarter notes, metronome, right hand -- scientifically very safe, but musically really boring. 
And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. 
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures. 
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us, because the street furniture had not yet arrived. 
And it completely threw science on its head. 
Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million actually. 
And then it's my box. 
No one has seen this before. This is literally stuff that we've come through last week. 
So, let's explore. 
When I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice, because I was taught at a very early, young age -- when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school -- that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age. 
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. 
And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves. 
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. 
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?" 
And we take this utterly for granted, because we're a species that is so at home with language, but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language. 
We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure. 
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium? 
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah. 
I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects. 
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable. 
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms. 
As I diminished, I grew. 
We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil, and no one had bothered to add them up before. 
And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body. 
What we saw was a natural experiment. 
Now we know today -- this was revealed by Thomas Reed, Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary -- this explosion was actually the result of a CIA sabotage operation, in which they had managed to infiltrate the IT management systems of that pipeline. 
Buy it anyway. 
Thank you. 
So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. 
That's a little bit scary. 
It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. 
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. 
But I'm not ashamed of my self. 
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."

New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims, and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there. 
So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. 
What issues deeply concern you? 
Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough, because these documents, most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan, in Venetian dialect, so you need to transcribe them, to translate them in some cases, to index them, and this is obviously not easy.

But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific. 
What's the point of teaching people math? 
They give us our identity and a sense of community. 
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. 
But the point, of course, is still to say, if you get another 100 billion dollars, we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we? 
So the engineer's boss said, "Find a way to quiet this train." 
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies, and not for everybody else.

The Tarahumara had a different strategy. 
Is there a chance you'll see her there?" 
Anyone who's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex. 
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants.

I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. 
About 900 people died that day, most of them taking their own lives. 
(Laughter) was what any self-respecting researchers would have done. 
So, shortly, I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco-Heroes. 
I moved back to Kenya in 2011. 
What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. 
I'll just give that to you one more time.

And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles. 
Now, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002, the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. 
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball. 
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. 
What happens to creativity in our age? 
Behold the world in pause. 
It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening. 
And it is much harder, often, to be compassionate towards those closest to us, which is another quality in the universe of compassion, on its dark side, that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. 
And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this, I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa, I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India, I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards.

They're not statistically significant. 
And I speak, but this is an amazing audience, and what am I doing here? 
He's approaching the end of the run, makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. 
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. 
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others, and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free and, implicitly, more happy. 
But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere, with people to talk to about those books, this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing. 
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly. 
Most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X." 
This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.

You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers. 
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. 
So 37 is our target audience. 
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science because they can't comprehend what it's about. 
Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another. 
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. 
What is the default setting if people do nothing, if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?

the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago. 
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century, that scarcity started to get eroded -- and I don't mean by digital technology; I mean by analog technology. 
I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented, and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin. 
So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible. 
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa? 
Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. 
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun. 
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh.

And there's only data where there is light. 
It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.

Ask for compassion. 
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube, and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes. 
They started telling the West, "Be aware of Al-Qaeda. 
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. 
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes. 
So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children, and they found that, across space and time, all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow. 
And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. 
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance. 
To compensate this loss of inner control, they try to control the outside, very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately, this fits very well into the traditional side, regressive side, repressive side, restrictive side of the cultural context. 
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God. 
But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. 
In this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on -- that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. 
If you look like that, you look to the past, or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself. 
And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun: we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. 
We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently, and there were literally 100,000 or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability. 
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket. 
This is when I was in Texas. 
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+. (Laughter) What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create. 
It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. 
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system. 
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them. 
You just have to feed me." 
Actually it was a very hard challenge. 
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. 
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability. 
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? 
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is: How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on? 
Her friend says, "Buy it already." 
You don't need that much up there. 
Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved? 
Last summer when we were in our home in New York, he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working, and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy." 
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before. 
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi. 
One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects. 
With all of our projects, our public space projects, we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces, move the furniture, take care of the plants. 
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity. 
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem. 
In the first panel, we see the moment of creation. 
There's no real, true balancing going on, and in a sense, the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges. 
And for Parkinson's disease, Cochlear implants, these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder. 
Gotten sick of the chicken fat. 
You can do it with threats of coercion, "sticks," you can do it with payments, "carrots," or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. 
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. 
I was slowly losing weight, but for me, that was what the doctor told me to do. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. 
Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called "Cancer Alley," and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and, in the process, kills people. 
This is what happened in Tunisia. 
And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents, his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz. 
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube. 
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves. 
(Laughter) Sure, if we get it wrong, we could face the end of this civilization, but if we get it right, it could be the beginning of civilization instead. 
Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market." 
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute, and we think about chips today, we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. 
By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. 
(Applause) Writing biography is a strange thing to do. 
Are we alone?" 
So that's just forming some body stuff, right? 
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites, so on. 
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. 
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away. 
(Laughter) Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?" 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis. 
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs. 
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. 
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits. 
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago. 
(Applause) Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. 
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing. 
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. 
And I came back, and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly, so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood, and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan. 
They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago. 
So what's the data? 
"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always." 
And then we grow these things, and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from, "Look, actually we're not just storing this to get the seeds later, but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants." 
(Laughter) So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business? 
And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action. 
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria. 
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole. 
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure. 
Make the audience put things together. 
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away. 
They want to have permission to do the right thing. 
And as a blind person, your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell. 
(Laughter) You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test. 
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff. 
And the soldiers are Chinese, and everybody else is Chinese. 
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener. 
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. 
Flavor is king. Flavor rules. 
Thank you very much. 
And this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me. 
It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern. 
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. 
So the camera's black and white. 
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France. 
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent, I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. 
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. 
We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system, because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth: The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. 
I think 2010 can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the 30-year cycle, and it's the birthday of the global food system. 
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world. 
the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences. 
Okay, you simply wouldn't. 
Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making -- it's the last to mature in late adulthood. 
And the third, democratic choice in Muslim-majority societies has been relegated to a political choice, meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party, but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party -- wanting to rule by military dictatorship. 
Its shape was too complex now. 
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?) JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?) JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments. 
This is about looking beyond your bias. 
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible, say yes -- a thousand times, yes -- and please turn out the lights. 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. 
People say, "Is such and such true?" 
He said, "I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. 
So how did it start? 
Now, there are less than 10,000, and family support services are provided across the country. 
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that, if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right; life cannot go on like that. 
How many other people? 
Yup, yup, I think I probably am. 
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy? 
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea. 
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on. 
The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter. 
But how will we know? How will we come to know? 
But really, you just want a better life for yourself. 
Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio. 
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. 
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. 
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. 
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point. 
And if these algorithms, like the algorithms on Wall Street, just crashed one day and went awry, how would we know? 
It's got to be long-lived molecules. 
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages. 
(Laughter) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you'll start to notice. 
So this is what I've learned from bread. 
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. 
"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me, by doing more of what I've asked them to do" -- extra credit, we might call it -- "until I love him or love her. 
What will happen is economic growth. 
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back, one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of. 
If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet, it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. 
It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world. 
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. 
So where would you put your brain on this scale? 
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself. 
Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay. 
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class. 
To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have, not by searching what other people may have written down before, but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions. 
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. 
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. 
In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis, you go to your doctor, and what do you get? 
It's not to do with electricity or water. 
All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either. 
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book. 
And she puts it in her friend's coffee. 
But I think his son will understand this, and will have no sense of grudge, or sense of being neglected, I think. 
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear. 
Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact of a health condition both on life expectancy as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use a metric called the DALY, which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year. 
It's also the very first letter of the word shalan, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. 
So we decided -- actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you. 
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. 
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. 
Or they can simply smile, and remain open to all possibilities. 
In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. 
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing, so I looked at Miguel. 
Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life. 
(Laughter) (Applause) The grandchildren are coming home. 
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation -- like literally two raindrops falling, and just watching that pattern is so stunning. 
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. 
One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel -- oil, coal or gas. 
And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? 
How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years? 
And I'll close it there. 
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road? 
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries, and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events. 
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer. 
I venture there are many in this room. 
So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good. 
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users, some years it's only pregnant women. 
This is what I'm building now -- they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments. 
And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it. 
We had to get rid of the smell. 
(Laughter) Solar technology is ... 
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation, hippie parents. 
"All right. Okay." 
The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. 
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer. 
Are we the victims of a mass delusion? 
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor. 
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it. 
Now, here's another thing that happens, which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome," which is that big, expensive things get big, highly-intelligent attention, and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent, until you get down to the small detail, the usability, which is the signage, which is catastrophic. 
So, I decided it was time to end and go back home. 
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around. 
This is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper. 
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool. 
It's not about the things that it brings. 
That's the old way, that's the old mantra: one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen. 
Porous, nonporous. 
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique. 
He's thinking about it. 
This is not a philosophical statement, this is just science based in physics, chemistry and biology. 
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas. 
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who, when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong. 
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion. 
Thank you very much indeed. (Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine. 
How amazing is that? 
So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project. 
And the local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB, immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken. 
And like Hitler, Goering fancied himself a collector of art. 
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth, and I held up another square that was the root two square -- so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans; and I said, what is the relative value of these two things? 
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far. 
And then our mothers tell us, "Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over. 
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows. 
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo. 
And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. 
In the rest of the cases, typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer. 
Now smile to go straight. 
What about bigger numbers? 
Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it? 
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. 
And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens, of our peoples, even more in the democratic process. 
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant, and all kinds of stuff. 
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them. 
They shouldn't be failing like this. 
Hundreds of people were paralyzed. 
It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music) And that actually reminded me of jazz great, Charlie Parker. 
This is last week in northern Kenya. 
In the time I have given this talk today, 34 people have died on America's roads. 
They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers, photography, industrial design. 
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office, and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now. 
So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient. 
Now, there is other origami in space. 
(Applause) Good afternoon. 
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain. 
For so much of my life, I wanted something else to make me happy. 
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages? 
We don't have that kind of situation. 
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts. 
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it. 
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. 
George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility, or their stability, you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. 
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day. 
Recording: Hi, my name is Ray, and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. 
Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago? 
Some of them elect not to save. 
You can get on a flight in London, you can end up in Bangalore later today. 
Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves. 
And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break. 
Why? Because if you earn a lot of money, you can give away a lot of money, and if you're successful in that career, you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers in developing countries, and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done. 
Here's one of the culprits. 
Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol, and alcohol has got some very interesting properties. 
This gives us genetic diversity, or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity. 
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. 
But it's ugly. 
And this was a reality that really struck me, because of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem. 
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. 
So, how do we have these conversations more easily and more often? 
And we're living in a great time right now, because almost everything's being explored anew. 
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think. 
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. 
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo. 
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist. 
I like that kind of quest for my daughter, and I like that kind of quest for my son. 
So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. 
I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. 
The whole resources are there available for you. 
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids, they have no embarrassment at all. 
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. 
I didn't know he was abusing me. 
And not only do we show them, but others can read them. 
So, this is the challenge for this bread. 
E: Hey, baby. 
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. 
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period. 
I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels. 
Now I'm going to step back in history. 
Now on the one hand, exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill," because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. 
(Laughter) And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free. 
And I think there's almost a paradox with those. 
(Laughter) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. 
The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. 
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much. 
Otherwise, it can't be done. 
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. 
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. 
And the people thought for themselves, "Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario." 
It doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there. 
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot. 
So I work in Singapore at the moment, and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology. 
We started asking our customers, did they feel an emotional connection with us, in one of seven different kinds of ways. 
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually. 
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways. 
This is a decrease by two-thirds. 
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me." 
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about. 
(Laughter) These are expressions of truth as awe-full things, by meaning they are things you can worship. 
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. 
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher. 
Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world, because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment. 
And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. 
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign. 
Now ideas have this amazing property. 
And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. 
Primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all. 
I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. 
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods. 
Africans and Indians, as usual, South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list. 
And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options. 
The most popular blogger -- it's not me -- it's a movie star, and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans. 
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body. 
(Laughter) And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere, everywhere. 
Throughout the tower, you come across all kinds of services, like the barber, small factories, and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. 
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year. 
I do. I look for it all the time. 
The people and the chairs are very different, but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same. 
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. 
I mean, the joke "One, Two, Three, Many" is kind of right. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
BG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. 
And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. 
They have higher blood pressure, poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes. 
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large. 
So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. 
I'll give you an analogy. 
And so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left, because there is still spectacular beauty. 
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school. 
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches. 
And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. 
But if it had been following the odor plume, it would have come in from the other direction. 
Or, is it, perhaps, possible? 
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels. 
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other, for better, or for worse. 
Can you write it using pictures? 
Anyone else for? Go. 
All backwards. 
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. 
Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? 
Telegraph? No. 
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures. 
My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand, stretching across the desert. 
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. 
I was married when I was 14. 
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. 
And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.

Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof. 
We've got to practice what we preach. 
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. 
We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. 
As we started to look at this information, we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria. 
One is: why isn't it happening now? 
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds. 
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns. 
It's an international project. 
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. 
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. 
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?" 
"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother. 
Saima's not going to produce you a son." 
We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. 
(Laughter) She should not go into banking, for example, or work at a cash register. 
So what we've got here now is the global footprint of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner. 
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour. 
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay. 
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do? 
And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive. 
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings. 
And then this happened. 
That is great, that means we're going to have 10 billion minds working together, 10 billion talents together. 
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture. 
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth." 
And it would be 30 years, but I would eventually get the answer to that question. 
They're not legally liable. 
And The 99 were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. 
We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. 
This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid, one that goes down frequently. 
I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there. 
In any case, as you may remember, the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s, some considerable time after decolonization. 
(Music) They speak when she touches them. 
So the question is: what do we do next? 
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate. 
Thank you. Thank you! 
Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars, like we can, and pick the right one to match? 
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. 
The babies in the United States are getting a lot better, babies in Japan are getting a lot worse, but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. 
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. 
(Laughter) A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome. 
And we eventually broke the code. 
If you could please stand up, [unclear]. 
But attached to the base of the wing is a set of little, tiny control muscles that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast, and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke-by-stroke basis, and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces which change its flight trajectory. 
What am I going to talk about? Okay. 
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did. 
I'm not going to get to 12. 
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong. 
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson. 
The little bottle says, "I just don't know." 
And everyone's somewhere in the middle. 
It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one. 
And I'm really excited about this, because it's a very compact core. 
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters, at that time three and a half, were missing me and feeling my absence. 
We learn about its orbit, the period of its orbit and so on. 
So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes, and we meet people along the way. 
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot. 
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you. 
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. 
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals, but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects, you have to understand a little bit about the back story. 
But online, everybody speaks at the same speed. 
She showed off her expensive bags, clothes and car on her microblog, which is the Chinese version of Twitter. 
If you generalize this, the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with, both easily and deeply, such as happiness, our own body, food, emotions. 
(Laughter) So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas, one in each hand. 
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. 
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain. 
And about five years ago, we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the U.K. 
We now are treating 325 people a month, despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. 
21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas: the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world, on the one hand, and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world, on the other hand. 
Poverty, despair, struggle. 
There are many health issues as well. 
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking, "Oh boy, I'm on totally the wrong track here. 
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam. 
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. 
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive. 
We now believe that in the early history of Mars, which is 4.6 billion years ago, 4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like. 
Today, it no longer is secure. 
These pictures I'm showing here, they are some pictures from Madureira. 
So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings, pets, potted plants, whatever was in there, were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well. 
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me? 
If not now, then when? 
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country. 
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am. 
But they all tell us what the natural variability is. 
We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. 
I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. 
And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers, between, say, the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile. 
In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you. 
But a small number of them did, and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill -- whose immune systems were probably compromised. 
So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas. 
And inside there's nothing; there's no famous actor's voice; there's no projections; there's no televisions; there's no color changing. 
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today. 
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate? 
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today. 
It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. 
You can take a runner like Ann Trason, or Nikki Kimball, or Jenn Shelton, you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. 
(Applause) Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy. 
Why don't we train our children in compassion? 
And this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who know my research and what I've done well. 
Spread the ideas. Spread the light. 
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios. 
For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. 
As he correctly guessed, some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. 
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone -- I can say this I guess because you've done it here -- he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker." 
We feel awe, we feel pity. 
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. 
When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. 
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. 
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began. 
So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable. 
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head. 
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked. 
The universality, to repeat, is us -- that we are the city. 
That's the experience of a clever ride. 
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. 
So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. 
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. 
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration. 
This is the retiree health care benefits. 
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story. 
And the truth is, recent research backs him up. 
And he says, "I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free." 
One of the largest consultants are the social insects. 
Now saving is a classic two selves problem. 
The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. 
Their marketing is slightly different. 
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. 
So everywhere we look, pretty much across the board, we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. 
Sometimes I would win, mostly he would win, but we both enjoyed them. 
But before I got to him, I was so lost. 
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this." 
Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. 
These are young sunflowers, and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. 
And the garden, it was beautiful. 
They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb. 
He didn't call it the hypotenuse, he called it the shortcut distance." 
What do you do? Of course you can call the police. 
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it, because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette. 
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year. The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections. 
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand anything that they're going to say, then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. 
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts, that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs. 
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again. 
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it. 
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time, moving towards a new place. 
But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that. 
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. 
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest. 
And so if you ask this question: Where would you look to see the future of education? 
So these three years, in the past three years, social movements about microblogging really changed local government, became more and more transparent, because they can't access the data. 
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink. 
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. 
We'd have to see at night, right? 
She was mesmerized. 
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city. 
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. 
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it. 
We have corporates that have stood behind us, and we are able to, now, open more schools. 
We're not trying to control polio. 
It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you. 
I go home, I look it up. 
It looks like a beautiful photograph. 
And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure, and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be. 
And yet, one is a chimp, and the other is a cow. 
(Applause) I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question: how can we make digital content graspable? 
They have the social connectedness. 
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down, in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay. 
Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever, but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon. 
You can't catch me. 
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things? 
It costs me five Kenyan shillings, or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China. 
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services, (Laughter) no longer tied to a single monopoly provider, in many cases, sourcing things locally, and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load-balancing. 
Thank you. 
And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. 
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing. 
So in fact, experimental economists had run this test around the world, and for much higher stakes, and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust, and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness. 
No! You select. 
In the face of death and destruction, our mundane differences evaporated, and we all became one even if for a few hours. 
But the objective of facing reality is to change reality. 
"But there is no law banning you from driving." 
Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. 
And so in my lifetime, a lot of what's happened in the world -- and being a person obsessed with food -- a lot of this has really changed. 
So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. 
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds. 
We're 3,000 strong right now. 
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life. 
Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. 
Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk. 
A game in which you give people money, and then, on each round of the game, they can put money into a common pot, and then the experimenter doubles what's in there, and then it's all divided among the players. 
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there. 
And the demand side being mostly politicians, bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them. 
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff, and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this. 
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. 
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants, because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed. 
Fourteen years ago, I searched for beauty in the traditional things, in craft forms. 
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus -- telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus -- various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly, in the ability to change perspective on things. 
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. 
Well first of all, it is a mind, which is a flow of mental images. 
And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors. 
It reminds me of my college days. 
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked. 
This is a new kind of solar cell that's based on how a leaf works. 
You're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital? 
Does Amazon carry it? 
I was also influenced by another experience that I had, again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford. 
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone. 
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. 
We actually think the future's going to be event-driven. 
It was like cell phones strapped to your head. 
That's the only way that we could have done this. 
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us. 
I think usually, as companies get bigger, they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects. 
And I remember reading that book, and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate, to send bits of information from one star system to another. 
Let's bring the military back again." 
He said they were wrong. 
And the way you should do that is study the furniture, let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself, and then a few days later, go with your gut, because unconsciously you've figured it out. 
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years. 
Who's going after Chinese, which now has 400 million internet users out there? 
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. 
Is fission kind of played out, or is there something left to innovate here? 
But interestingly, they have a sense of humor. 
So if I squeeze the base, the bands go from base to tip. 
And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood? 
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil? 
Well, at some level, we think all of these things should work. 
The next day, the land looked like this. 
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. 
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. 
And then when we look at religions, we can see that the Eastern religions, indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children. 
For example, molecular structure. 
He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes. 
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100, thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change, and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more, and who needed the help so much more?" 
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center. 
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati, who are over in Tarawa, the westernmost group. 
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space. 
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. 
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win. 
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, "Hey, can you deliver the pizza?" 
You may know one line of it, it says, "I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy." 
It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories, and they all burst, a huge, extended bacteria family, all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts, the viruses taking over the bacterium. 
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out, just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students, and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well, fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers, it probably wouldn't get published in a journal. 
(Laughter) Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. 
We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle, on Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats, gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun, the wind and the rain, and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route in Colorado with nobody at the wheel. 
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock. 
The goal of this whole film is transparency. 
And so, 25 years ago, there was a peak oil; just like, in the 1920s, there was a peak coal; and a hundred years before that, there was a peak wood. 
And indeed, I was very far from the mark. 
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies that these kids have made, and they're quite incredible. 
We are setting up a 10-year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system. 
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. 
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine. 
So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. 
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. 
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have." 
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues, and also fossil fuels, there is no one silver bullet. 
What's also interesting, if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value, a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value: They are often quite egalitarian. 
But we're spending 36 percent. 
But they want to use it -- seriously. 
And that creates a big problem. 
Perhaps denial. 
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. 
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished." 
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation? 
I don't know for sure, but I think at this point it's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try. 
So exactly why did China grow so much faster? 
And unfortunately when I first received the answers -- and here you'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed. 
Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those who lost their lives, and those who gave their lives to help others, but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country, the love, the compassIon, the strength, and I watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy. 
For this 102-year-old karate master, his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art. 
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. 
And there are 4,000 -- and still counting -- other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. 
And we compare that to the fame that we observe. 
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. 
That's grown this year to about 10. 
So the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face, oppressive governments or oppressive societies? 
But we also know where we are through movement. 
So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. 
Change has accelerated as human populations rose. 
They have this very continuous feedback loop. 
Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in, that we teach them in, are hideously insensate when it comes to space. 
And that was when I had the idea. 
In addition, if your body size, if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 -- if you're clinically obese -- we also colored the dots yellow. 
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now. 
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about. 
I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair, right? Where does all this stuff come from? 
Maybe you had a direct line. 
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy. 
Our farming has done the opposite. 
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries. 
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side, and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute, and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. 
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. 
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. 
Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars, and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon, but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet? 
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time. 
And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. 
So for instance, here is somebody using the tool. 
(Applause) My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes." 
And our media is less global by the day. 
We have the androids that are inspired by man. 
You can look at it from on top, from the ceiling. 
This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught. 
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that. 
I realized society didn't value my passion. 
How many of you have kids? 
Of course, it was the same man, but she was seeing him in different ways. 
People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. 
So if you imagine a very, very big universe, an infinitely big universe, with randomly bumping into each other particles, there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states, and then they relax back. 
So I took the husbands along. 
And I'd like to show it. 
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power," and we hope that that will help, but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them if, at the same time, actively or passively, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power? 
The meat is torn up. 
So it wasn't about symmetry. 
So, I have now showed you three projects, and you might ask yourself, what is it good for? 
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. 
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see. 
Local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese, and this was a really big commitment. 
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show. 
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven, which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. 
We all love chocolate. 
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras? 
The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. 
As everybody knows, you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus. 
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. 
It took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. 
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. 
Here's another story. 
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. 
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact, and understand, maybe, the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work. 
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline. 
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles in the right direction. 
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool." 
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions. 
Can we play that one? 
To try and answer that question of, "What am I supposed to be doing with my life?" 
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate. 
(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. 
And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor, you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!" 
If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does, we could achieve factor 10, factor 100, maybe even factor 1,000 savings in resource and energy use. 
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man." 
(Applause) The coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." 
Google is a company born of idealism. 
This chart is going to document a very similar trend. 
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken. 
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. 
I want to make my friends understand: China is complicated. 
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.) (Applause) It's a simple idea about nature. 
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it." 
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife. 
(Applause) My journey to coming here today started in 1974. 
CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. 
Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass. 
(Laughter) When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. 
Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live. 
Chekhov said, "The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. 
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon. 
Remember, it's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics, and let's say we could take two of them, like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines. 
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality. 
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk to each other a couple of times. 
You look at South Asia, and people are. 
And it's true; there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile. 
And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. 
And two of them, two 20-something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. 
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. 
MR: Thank you very much indeed. 
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. 
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift. 
Obviously experimentation is very important. 
They didn't help at all. 
that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. 
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids, and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are, these are still war movies. 
"Are you carrying clean needles?" 
And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing, not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion. 
When they're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income. 
So, to make the point, these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash, 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons. 
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. 
We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music. 
I'm like, "That's stupid because you have to work for five hours. 
ML: It's much better than that. 
(Laughter) (Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel. 
NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind, for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich, where products of intellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life. 
And in 2009, I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year. 
I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. 
Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. 
And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity, my mother told me of the miracle I was, said I could grow up to be anything I want. 
Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Africa to the rest of the world. 
For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall. 
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate. 
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars," do you know what she said? 
Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. 
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. 
But terrorists aren't the only threat we face. 
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. 
And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. 
Because think about it: An animal is a sensory-based thinker, not verbal -- thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells. 
So that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits. 
In order to survive, he needed to be working. He asked the man to write "dyer." 
You can vary enormously. 
The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. 
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control, which includes usability, understanding -- but also the feel and heft. 
I'm an artist, so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art, science and culture. 
The second thing is: speak up. 
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, "You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. 
This map can be updated, and we can add in new data. 
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 
I need to be reborn again. 
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops, and maybe 50 million next year. 
And at some point I found out, when a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid, which is difficult, because what you really want to do is go away. 
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get? 
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly. 
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. 
Sorry, this is a global story. 
This is the Jewish version of the same story. 
I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature. 
So you start really understanding that you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet, and once you start looking, and from that point on, everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information, the production of information, the preparation of information, I've looked at from the viewpoint of food. 
And the nice thing about this, we have a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up, and this let's them really make money. And I -- you know, there's a number of people I met -- I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party, and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money. 
We created the modern welfare state. 
He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated. 
That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. 
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that. 
I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially. 
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. 
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did." 
We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. 
This is a great technology. 
And I forgot to bring one up with me. 
The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. 
And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity, some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. 
(Applause) So here's the good news about families. 
And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. 
That was the problem. 
Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris. Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley. 
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems, and when you do that, you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt. 
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture, so I made one. 
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. 
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it. 
(Laughter) I wanted to race cars, and I wanted to be a cowgirl, and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book." 
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years. 
To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. 
And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory, out of those association cortices, and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception. 
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur, because there isn't a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude, what are the positive emotions. 
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. 
And all those stories are being heard at the same time. 
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. 
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. 
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. 
(Laughter) I thought I was a hero. 
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. 
Their business trajectory would change. 
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. 
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?" 
What it's about instead is finding the true believers. 
So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated, which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo. 
The technology will advance even further, but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago, "Remember, darling, you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers." 
You can paint a hive to match your home. 
This is a robot, Autom. 
And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, "I don't use a car." 
I mean, it could be somebody's health, it could be somebody's career, something important to them. 
But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been, I suspect, more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA, even than making an exception for Casey Martin. 
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. 
(Laughter) Actually, he was meditating on compassion. 
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary. 
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in, for instance, the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent. 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. 
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun -- in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it. 
I must admit, I used to be one of them. 
And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it, wanting to track down the source -- (Laughter) saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source." 
I hate to argue with Einstein, but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued, aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane? 
We don't have disposable resources. 
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own. 
The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow. 
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s, but I deliberately waited a really long time. 
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. 
It can be put up in any environment, from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields, because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools. 
And on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes. 
And the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied. 
And he makes this complicated thing. 
And we need to support it financially. 
And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain. 
Oh, yeah, you know this one? 
That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. 
That gives the impression, has given the impression, to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. 
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. 
We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot, and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning, and it happens pretty early on. 
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter. 
I like to think -- Thank you. 
I thought that was it. 
I ended up creating a melody out of it. 
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people. 
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. 
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. 
A guy goes into a psychiatrist. 
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal: half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day; a billion people with no access to clean water; two and a half billion no access to sanitation; a billion going to bed hungry every night; one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age. 
Now, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year, where millions of them come together, but it's not why I started studying them. 
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing. 
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying, but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people getting infected every year. 
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox. 
What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh! 
(Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one. 
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. 
(Applause) Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. 
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie. 
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure, here's the same story, the same progression, told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago, in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. 
It wasn't the only passion I had. 
So, for example, I was giving this talk recently in New York City, and I said, "You know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you, and you just instinctively smile back?" 
And that's been my humbling experience in this. 
They travel down roads. 
Could it be -- a devastating question, a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte -- could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete? 
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. 
It's the last defense before anything enters the body. 
I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference, but can we come back here in 30 years and say, "What we have done, it really prompted a change for the better." 
And we finally figured out how to do it. 
And it starts with three people. 
When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world. 
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day. 
There are about 30,000 in use now. 
So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates. 
The women in this room and watching in L.A. 
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily. 
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
That their parents be less tired and less stressed. 
Maybe select a little bit of that. 
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm, capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago. 
It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it, and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart. 
And the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important, because when new cells are formed, these strands come apart, new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process. 
I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school. 
I can stand here right now and see, as I go tearing into the water after him, the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. 
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go. 
Equally untidy office there, as you can see. 
So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. 
And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. 
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp organized by the U.N. 
You can tell that from the little barbs on there. 
But culturally, we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic, and we expect that. 
I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs, and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day. 
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. 
Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. 
If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution. 
Light 'em all up. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
It's just a quick video of what we do. 
They're not even aware of this themselves. 
Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. 
And that's where they do their experiments, and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down. 
But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. 
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. 
You go back to that original room. (Laughter) Have you ever forgotten your keys? 
And we're acting out of that fear. 
Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?" 
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you." 
The 1950s: June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver." 
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge, we kept having to put them back up. 
There are so many things to be happy about. 
And we're seeing people transform their lives. 
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. 
Profound leaps forward! 
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. 
When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth, his hands moved as if in slow motion. 
I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games. 
It's a magical place. 
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle. 
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent. 
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand. 
And you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another. 
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities, scaling this so we build many more? 
And it should be able to tell us that. 
1877: The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. 
With the sub's lights switched off, it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh. 
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. 
So let's look at the numbers. 
And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things, where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything, and then, at the last minute, they landed. 
So one answer was George Clooney. 
So one of these take-home messages here is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans. 
It is actually worth 10 bananas." 
It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things, a great big gas balloon. 
After all, in this country as well, all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization. 
So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally. 
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many. 
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal. 
And yet, nobody listened to them. 
It depends solely on the bat. 
We can then choose, from among a range of options, the best one. 
That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that. 
That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food. 
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. 
What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ... 
We're facing a very powerful opponent. 
Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives. 
So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?" 
Looked for something different for the second one. 
And so we measured its motion. 
He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal, or should I untie him?" 
Five new flagship stores opened. 
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers. 
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles, this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up. 
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. 
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. 
And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time -- I told her how I ended up in Australia, how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket, and all the stories. 
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point, please let me know. 
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s. 
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement, and I don't really understand any of that. 
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did, no matter where they live. 
A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine. 
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this. 
But the result is always to have stories. 
And we have testosterone. 
To our knowledge they had no music. 
And what did we talk about? 
Does your brain have to send little painters in there? 
Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter. 
And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important. 
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. 
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out. 
I would give my viewpoints to people. 
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. 
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola. 
You might think these must be very senior teachers. 
You could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships, spousal relationships, co-worker relationships, neighbor relationships and the like. 
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat? 
Now of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. 
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet. 
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. 
And that was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life, a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say, "You've been an incredibly important person in my life," was a moment that I didn't even remember. 
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office," which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture. 
That is very, very important. 
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. 
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter) So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. 
My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T, "If I had asked people then what they wanted, they would have answered, 'We want faster horses.'" So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. 
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive, so very few will be able to basically afford that. 
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called. 
That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. 
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA, and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body, I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. 
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it." 
(Applause) But it was only the beginning. 
And I needed to find something historically that would match that. 
(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face? 
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first, and which one should we do afterwards? 
That's the best part. 
We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on -- for something like Prozac, in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected -- but we also get to see the whole thing. 
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains, training in preparation for some high altitude jumps. 
Now, we can measure this, and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves. 
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine. 
I don't know, what should I do?" 
(Applause) Last question, Julian. 
And it can also turn into a commodity, which is a very scary thing. 
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows. 
People started buying appetizers and salads, because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. 
The number of people living in back-breaking, soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000 and then to 21 percent by 2010. 
Here are two very different walls, very different geometric pictures. 
So I could do a lot of projects, and here I am going to share with you only three of them. 
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees. 
Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy, like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet. 
And that same year, 10 years ago, I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. 
As the length of the construction takes years, workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building. 
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks, and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think, that's a great support group. 
Two rows from this table of two billion entries. 
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily. 
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine. 
(Laughter) But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens. 
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. 
That compassion is actually an inherent human quality. 
(Laughter) DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. 
It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. 
So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special. 
And this one actually carries two great manipulators. 
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. 
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement. 
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently, that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world, from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. 
(Laughter) I miss Michael. 
And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. 
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want. 
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left. 
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. 
But up until, literally, 15 years ago, that was all we knew about planets. 
That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. 
Let's call him Don too. 
I mean it really is. 
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. 
Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security. 
We've started to ask the question: Can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive? 
(Applause) KB: What a tongue. 
And so we've created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production. 
This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. 
So we asked those guys to do it again. 
So we can do some rather amazing things. 
That's the way to handle this. 
I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom. 
Belinda died and within a few days of her death, they published a book for her, and she used my cartoon on the cover. 
The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives. 
What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls, do they have the same symmetries? 
And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes, and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. 
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. 
High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money. 
It preps you. It aims you. 
Let's try this here. 
With economic opportunity, it can be transformative. 
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that, you get 40 extra years of education. 
In our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. 
And the results were super dramatic. 
Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride. 
So, in both of these cases, you've got these cycles of improvement, apparently driven by people watching web video. 
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide, you know, whether I’m right or somebody else is right, are the people in our community in the next generation, in 30 and 50 years. 
Not bad. It's also not good. 
We don't really like to only consume. 
(Tapping) So my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe. 
And that's the power of storytelling. 
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. 
This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you, that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff. 
Some ideas I've had is like, look, the reality is -- kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. 
And then, within zoology, I took the course or the discipline of entomology, the science of insects. 
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. 
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg. 
I'll just mention two generalizations in this area. 
It won't cost us any more to do it the right way." 
As an eight year-old, he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city, looking for Tamils like Renu to murder. 
You spoke about the responsibility of the press. 
The electron hits it suddenly. 
So those are the consequences. 
And testing breakaway signpost pillars. 
For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling -- to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder. 
He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career, an academic career, he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living. 
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa. 
The Transition gives you a safer, more convenient and more fun way of using this resource.

They get building material for houses, a contract for selling the sugar, so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. 
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane. 
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. 
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment? 
I was very conscious of this as I took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1945. 
His name is Chris Farina. 
And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray. 
And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it. 
This is another sound from my group. 
So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself. 
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT. 
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building. 
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. 
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques. 
So I said, "I'll hold it for you." 
We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner. 
At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. 
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades. 
And they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. 
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. 
They're motivated by something else -- motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs. 
Thank you very much. 
And so she must have taken the ferry over. 
Only then do I construct it. 
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us. 
Every dot is a person, and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. 
Among other things, if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are, it's always better to own an original than a forgery because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries. 
(Music) That's them rolling. 
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year. 
The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild. 
But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations. 
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics, and the speed, and the players in the industry. 
There are two basic types of innovation. 
And two years in, I really could see very little. 
So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore. 
Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the "highlighter version," which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.

And they said, "We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning." 
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No. 
But despite my like for them, there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices, and you might feel this if you use them yourself. 
It was just a story. 
This photograph was taken on completion day, and just one year later, it looked like that. 
How can the nervous system get this so wrong? 
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach. 
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. 
(Laughter) And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness." 
This isn't faith. 
Umami -- this is a meaty taste. 
New forms became bats. Civets.

Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray. 
If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. 
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants. 
They got to the Pole late January 1912 to find a Norwegian flag already there. 
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb, we're the best on the planet. 
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free. 
Please let there be some left.'" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, "You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid." 
I tried a bunch of different stuff. 
We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now. 
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue. 
I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it. 
Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox, better education, health service. 
(Applause) How many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader? 
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired. 
"No thank you," was more like it. 
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine, blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day. 
And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking, right. 
By 2010, I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. 
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda, and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there. 
And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. 
"FeliCity." 
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. 
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city. 
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. 
And within that context, we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives. 
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. 
Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway. 
This software allows interactive use, so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. 
To the contrary, we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests, which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups, the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. 
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. 
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is. 
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. 
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. 
This was me at age 13, when I started my first diet. 
A very silly, trivial thing to do, but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all, that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee, or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity. 
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based. 
Is it a utilitarian object? 
Actually, for the first 20 years, the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow. 
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey. 
Here is another example in the Alhambra. 
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. 
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor. 
These have been private meetings so far. 
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility, not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. 
This is live transmission. 
And is it fair to say that it's simple? 
So what did I learn? Well, here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza. 
So back to economics. 
In his deeply authentic self, he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter) He loved knitting. 
Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid, trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings, that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of HIV. 
So how does health and development market? 
We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not, but it can't. 
So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. 
Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years, and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data. 
Let us just take an example. 
But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature, what they found was a very different picture. 
You don't hear about lion attacks, there aren't a lot of lions around. 
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer. 
In order to write the book, I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was, who was the father she had known. 
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem, because you have to build a small, portable robot that's not only really affordable, but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. 
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off. 
What are you into? Who are you into? 
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. 
I am productive. 
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, and that was great, and we don't need them anymore, and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially? 
Here's one young man who's taken this advice. 
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. 
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her. 
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold. 
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because its body temperature is actually relatively low. 
One person wrote in, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top." 
So what's not to like? 
Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. 
No, they want judgment. 
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. 
Thank you very much for your time. 
It's plenty. 
And it's produced a great amputation, a shallow view of human nature. 
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction. 
And look at this: they even teach their kids -- they train them in the same way the U.S. Marines train. 
And one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. 
We really showed that, yes, we can. 
And really, I feel as though, when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does, like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. 
What if it was a security patch? 
All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly, all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available, and it's not the same as laminar. 
We had the bursting of the tech bubble. 
But you know what? It's revolutionary, and it's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this. 
And the song, 18 months old, went back to number four on the iTunes charts. 
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man. 
All you can do is learn to recognize it and own it. 
When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. 
So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings, I ask people to go on a walking meeting, to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week. 
We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. 
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to. 
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. 
I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years." 
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia, but not to have hair from Texas. 
That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand, you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous. 
It's been widely heralded. 
And there's a cause for that, all right. 
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz" to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. 
The audience can talk back. 
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. 
Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe. 
And for a while that was looking really good. 
But like the Maginot Line, the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge, because not one of those four things was true in this environment. 
(Laughter) My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop. 
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy, but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane. 
It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. 
He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes. 
Look at that picture. 
And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients. 
But, it is entertaining. 
In my case it's quarterly. 
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs. 
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever. 
And then we have intentions. 
These are both real objects. 
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them, except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage. 
And for that I do not need an electric grid between us. 
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers. 
I'd like to share a couple with you today. 
It all started back in 2001. 
Two months later, I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief. 
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness. 
They're in there. 
Later, I understood why my father got so upset. 
The project launched in April 2005. 
But after one week of practicing, my throws became more like this. 
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open source collaboration. 
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. 
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating. 
DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. 
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. 
The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong. 
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS. 
We're heading to the future of bits, where everything is speedy, it's weightless. 
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently. 
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained. 
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models? 
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane, so, you see what the problem is? What once made you safe now drives you insane. 
Look at this. 
Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. 
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea, and that's why I want you today to try to think about this, think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. 
And one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws, and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric. 
Come on. Get up. 
And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things, a big fat "no," everybody imagines I was devastated. 
And Country 2 is possibly India." 
One out of every seven people. 
So, this would be the Twitter search screen. 
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. 
His brothers, Benjamín and Julián, got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action: to pay the ransom, to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help. 
And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in 2004. 
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot. 
What happens to the grass when you do this? 
So that's what I'm working on now. 
We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high. 
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe, and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe. 
There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating, and that's that it forages and provisions a nest. 
In the 19th century, it was slavery. 
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this. 
My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher, in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations," is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business. 
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses. 
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all, it's these guys; it's fireflies. 
Behind each image is a story. 
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org, where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries -- it's done by U.N. specialists. 
"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out. 
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of. 
That's what keeps you from getting help. 
Behind every window and door frame, you'll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. 
And this is two kinds. 
He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. 
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families -- the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it. 
I suppose it is, so I won't say revolution -- but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton, and of particles beyond that. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
What's the budget for protective equipment? 
(Laughter) Thank you. 
The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, invading all space, and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state. 
But let me just try a couple. 
We should call it what it is: a business in liquidation, a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. 
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1. 
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning.

Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson. 
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.

That, under all circumstances, they have pushed the boundary. 
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer, except there was one problem. 
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons. 
So also, put reliable stuff last, the stuff that's going to run every time. 
They only eat milkweed as larvae. 
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. 
But there is something more profound here, something deeper. 
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. 
Again, we're talking about outliers -- there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there. 
It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. 
And of course, the major thing: learn to pay attention, to concentrate and focus your attention. 
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they. 
My hair wasn't right. 
And we can scale this model. 
That is a picture of my mother, and she recently got a Facebook account. 
How can we explain this universality? 
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer, because it will break your legs very, very quickly if you land on it wrong. 
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important, and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here, we just give problems to students; we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. 
(Applause) HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much. 
One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world. 
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. 
Well, he was complicated. 
Audience: Fold. 
(Applause) Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. 
And there are two key things it's got to do. 
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. 
It was fought for, it was campaigned for, And this great news gives birth to even more great news, because the historic trend is this. 
He was the most respected scientist in the field. 
So I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris, you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes, or a factory with chemical toxins, and it leads to habitat restoration. 
The year after it's $100, give or take a year. 
Joseph Kim: In Korean? 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea. 
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings. 
Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. 
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs, we have doubled the amount of miles we drive. 
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy, as well as "Maestro," because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. 
There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe -- encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. 
We may not be that many, but if we are promoted as a good, positive example, there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again, coming to the bridge -- between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion. 
After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product. 
The captain waved me over. 
They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not. 
I don't know. (Laughter) So, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say, we shall try to speak about something else. 
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics. 
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. 
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment, and I got frustrated, and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream, and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. 
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that. 
Ask yourself, is this company behaving in a socially responsible way? 
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. 
"What do we do now? 
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that. 
What defines a story? 
This kid needs a lot of work." 
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this. 
And that's okay. 
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay. 
And I tested them. 
So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again. 
This is scrolling up the East coast. 
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out how we can change rules. 
Perhaps anger. 
It physically carves out conversation space for one. 
FG: No, it's near the current campus. 
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged, and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south. 
And it goes like this. 
The reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the United Nations. 
And then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment, so what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up. 
And that went on for about two years, until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III. 
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. 
We'll call them biological modification tools. 
That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses. 
I couldn't even do the simplest trick, but it was very natural for me, because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports. 
(Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. 
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims, hated by the Taliban. 
And we talked about snakes. I don't know why we talked about snakes. 
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest, like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe. 
And I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting. 
Now, I must tell you that this was never a very popular argument, and it's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience. 
But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases, their own overconfidence. 
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior. 
I'm not quite sure. 
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs. 
Not an easy project. 
So mentoring, we've all kind of heard that before, it's in the vernacular. 
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars. 
Look, invade, subdue them, take their resources. 
And we have to do it this year in those two big summits. 
And he said, "Madam, move your chair." 
But there's a bunch of different styles. 
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker, the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound. 
Yes, it does say that, but in a very specific context: the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden, and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. 
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina" and its famous opening sentence, "All happy families are alike. 
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. 
And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor. 
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival. 
Here's a typical street view. 
I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands -- India is all about thousands. 
This is what it's about. 
Yeah, but you know what? You stuff that down your shorts, when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free, everybody bought them. 
But I think being different is good, because you present a different point of view. 
It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection. 
It opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. 
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts. 
But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations? 
(Laughter) Thought the guy was going to come back and be like, "We've been looking for you for 200 years." 
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. 
It's mostly farmland. 
He'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second. 
Human contracted itself blind, malignant. 
You can have a succession of changes. 
So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot. 
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. 
In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles. 
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. 
(Music) (Laughter) So there's a picture of my toaster. 
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we're paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. 
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end. 
These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. 
(Music) (Applause) I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way, like I can train my body, so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being. 
So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high. 
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries. 
You've misunderstood totally," he said. 
Samuel Johnson, the great lexicographer, [posed] it through his character Rasselas in his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia," published in 1759. 
And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist. 
And on the right-hand side, we show the same data, but here with daily incidence. 
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them. 
And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other. 
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. 
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do. 
The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair, in need of charity. 
The academic publishing environment is very different now. 
Early filer and late filer." 
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow, and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down, we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. 
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. 
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. 
But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. 
(Laughter) Now after sporulation, the spores repel. 
This was, at a distance, realizing that someone was feeling something, wanting to affect them in a particular way, using media to do it, putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. 
So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career. 
So we’ve run two flight schools. 
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. 
What we're trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this. 
That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself. 
And we were able to grow this software footprint, and a few years later it became very useful software, and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were, and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
Then one plus two is three, two plus three is five, three plus five is eight, and so on. 
What happened next, of course? 
People from all different kinds of disciplines, they think of themselves as only analytical. 
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night, the phone rings and it's The New York Times. 
But the problem is, how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power? 
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo! 
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. 
Thank you. 
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other, are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged. 
I would have stopped to help." 
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day. 
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. 
We have to gradually increase the complexity. 
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts. 
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area. 
So we call it a relational universe. 
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them. 
And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves, to have the faculties to be able to deal with information, to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly. 
I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story. 
I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep. 
So there's no control; there's no control group. 
These are 35,830 lines of information. 
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons. 
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity, scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. 
It's a story of intercultural intersections, and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies? 
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix. 
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? 
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study -- I know this will come as a shock to all of you -- the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. 
But then sometimes I'm thinking, what are today's young generation up to? 
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie. 
Almost nothing has changed. 
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism. 
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. 
Radio 2: That was gorgeous. 
Is life that improbable?" 
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. 
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. 
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are. 
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. 
But when I look towards the future, the next project is completely unknown and wide open. 
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. 
And so I went back and I studied my first two acts, trying to see who I was then, who I really was -- not who my parents or other people told me I was, or treated me like I was. 
The instrument always ends up resembling its model.] (Music) Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt, they're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity, because I desperately needed these objects in my movie. 
This is what's going to take a bit of money. 
It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century. 
Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him." 
That's the consequence that we have to face. 
Let's say, for the sake of argument, my mission is to get 15 pies and I can get 15 pies by killing these cute, little monsters. 
So for me, to me, are beyond imagination at the moment. 
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, "You can," then they will. 
This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along: "Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address. 
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. 
Then, so, before breakfast, you've already met the pig so many times. 
Now, we had released, early in the year, a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy, but this is not necessarily connected. 
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms: true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea, which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to. 
It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two-dimensional. 
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there, which I've made from a tree trunk. 
And fortunately I decided in 2008 to return to Ghana, after 28 years of absence. 
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West. 
Because there is this asymmetry, which creates, basically, failing governance. 
Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him. 
So, do we need this? 
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. 
There are four on-board micro-controllers that, each time this ring rotates it, as it passes the rear of the display, it picks up a position signal. 
It's important because if you solve these problems, you can solve the problems of poverty in the world. 
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. 
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana." 
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant. 
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. 
Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later. 
And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test, if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines who are there, who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say, "I want to be on their team," because they're going to be on their team. 
And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. 
In fact, when we use all these things, what we've found is that, in some cases, energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent. 
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was all men are created equal. 
And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side. 
I'll tell you what happened. 
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about? 
You know, it's not as though we don't have the technological solution, but these women have three strikes against them: they are poor, they are rural and they are female. 
As Christian iconography got changed, and swastikas were created out of crucifixes, Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada, also going back to the Bible. 
And yet it doesn't happen. 
"What do you want to do in a village? 
I am a native of Burkina Faso. 
How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? 
And for good reason. 
We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered. 
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding. 
And they weren't flashing in anger, they were flashing in love, intense love for her students. 
The opposite happened. 
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable. 
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari, a longtime San Francisco educator -- she was teaching in Mexico City, she had all the experience necessary, knew everything about education, was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood -- I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching. 
And so what I decided to do. 
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work. 
Now if you think about it, if I tossed a coin a hundred times, and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times, then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads. 
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory. 
This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe, and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. 
So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course, which I find kind of funny, because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. 
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing, but I realized there were not enough for everyone, so I decided against it. 
There's almost nothing left. 
That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. 
Or look at Google. 
Okay, try this. Bring it back. 
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with, so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff, and then lower security cases. 
And I survive. 
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention, meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge, they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. 
So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. 
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. 
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets. 
Now if you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks. 
And so we did a six-month pilot. 
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self-interest to do this. 
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it. 
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from, rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. 
Now, California's considering similar legislation, and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas. 
And it was really terrific. 
So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables and say, "That's all we have." 
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely, years after we're gone. 
We are all different from different perspectives. 
They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive, downloaded, streaming, HD reality. 
Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now, all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said, "Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?" 
Let's do something about it." 
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. 
We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill, but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings, living people. 
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs, about what they really are, what they came from, what they're made of, what their hidden nature is. 
And this, over the years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage. 
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money? 
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life. 
I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem. 
No, you've got it all wrong." 
She's exaggerating." 
Now, when I was first doing this, all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources. 
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it. 
Harvard was wrong, big time. (Laughter) Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy. 
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective. 
It's such a huge subject." 
It's keeping the lights on. 
If you don't, you're not alone. 
Hospital readiness is critical. 
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point. 
So it was true. 
Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated, as we have seen at Copenhagen. 
And this made me really sad. 
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. 
I started to speak with the community, and I could convince everybody, and we could start to work. 
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static. 
That DNA is passed down through our mothers. 
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person. 
We have focused on the worst-case scenario. 
Ushahidi, by contrast, is civic value. 
You say, "How is that possible?" 
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now: the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap, Generation X, which is a small generation. 
He was actually collecting fish. 
This is a 15 year-old boy. 
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted. 
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. 
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?" 
If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. 
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military, accused of being a terrorist, and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum. 
♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫ ♫ Maybe humming along ♫ ♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫ I'm a huge believer in hands-on education. 
Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be. 
I like this question. It's about a water tank. 
I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s, called "I, Pencil" in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made, and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil, because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite, and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. 
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition. 
And the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use, because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. 
What do I get there?" 
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
This is more than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. 
Well, here is a thought experiment for you. 
Why was it effective? 
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated. 
But that, as I said, we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. 
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... 
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here. 
They were taking 3,000 children, they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills, six of them a day, and then a year later, they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. 
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. 
This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts? 
You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled. 
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. 
You'll need to attract firms, who will come hire the people who move there first. 
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was, that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was, that beneath my smile, there was struggle, and beneath my light, there was dark, and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. 
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro. 
But it is not part of metabolism itself. 
Since 2000, already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them. 
But we have to continue this journey, and we have to tell people, and we have to prove it can work." 
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. 
I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers." 
I'll talk you through one example, and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of, and that's the example of Al-Qaeda. 
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. 
This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum. 
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it; we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved. 
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. 
Words too, for me, have colors and emotions and textures. 
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops, and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling, and have them work with the kids. 
And it's like a magnet. 
And we open up so many more possibilities. 
And I could not disagree more. 
And then finally, turn it back to the real world. 
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh, and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker. 
There are a lot of people who are frustrated." 
Why have you taken our apple? 
So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality. 
"A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer." 
Audience: Shake. Fold. 
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news. 
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years. 
Mahatma Gandhi, one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world." 
The third set of ideas are what I call as "ideas that we argue about" -- those are ideas where we have a fight, an ideological battle about how to do things. 
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. 
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground. 
I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. 
But I actually came to this issue in a different way. 
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. 
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. 
(Laughter) SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. 
(Laughter) RG: Cruel. 
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. 
At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening. 
And that's what it looked like. 
So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? 
We want things that are designed not that rare event. 
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out. 
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. 
And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data. 
I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you. 
The next slide is going to be gruesome. 
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. 
Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen, they are down to the last few remaining members. 
I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist. 
He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old. 
So if you think of a map of your country, I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth, you could draw little circles to say, "These are places where good teachers won't go." 
They can adjust and find their comfort they need to find. 
And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. 
The old shyness was a fear of rejection. 
And here's scaling of cities. 
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter. 
My skill is not in the mathematics. 
But I don't think that we were that way initially. 
So, here is the technology we have today. 
That's better than a glowing chicken. 
And so she thought, well, what the heck. 
No human heart is denied of that empathy. 
Historically, we've always acted as victims of something or somebody. 
And for most of those years, I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks? 
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. 
I look. Both are of the male sex. 
With immunization or bed nets, you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved. 
He said, that's what flutes are for -- to be played well. 
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.) MS: Charlie says -- We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply. 
First of all, we wanted small schools -- about 300, 400 pupils -- 14 to 19 year-olds, and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms, but through real-life, practical projects, working on commission to businesses, NGO's and others. 
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? 
(Applause) This story is about taking imagination seriously. 
They cannot prevent this. 
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York -- a place as different from San Francisco as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again. 
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae. 
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world. 
And the brain scans were identical in both activities. 
Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases. 
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. 
Very basic stuff, slightly suggestive of public park signage. 
In the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area. 
I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. 
But tell me, advertising for what? 
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. 
But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called "wasichu," and "wasichu" is a Lakota word that means "non-Indian," but another version of this word means "the one who takes the best meat for himself." 
And if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability. 
Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways, they have to be the same number, and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13. 
And the back story is this: SOPA and PIPA, as legislation, were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century. 
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts. 
We determine how this will all end. 
In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war, and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle, his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge, and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family, which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost. 
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face. 
Every person in this room do this: think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing, where you wondered, "What should I be doing?" 
And it turned out that one of the guys there, a friend of mine that I never actually met, but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry. 
But they couldn't get the results they wanted. 
It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you. 
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid, with about up to 250,000 dying. 
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years, the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. 
Which brings me to my third paradox. 
And actually it's called "Temple Grandin," not "Thinking In Pictures." 
The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. 
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties; another name for them could be "architecture" as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it. 
It was a lot of anger, insane humor, a lot of attention, outrage. 
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going, "Why would I conceivably care about this?" 
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards. 
So if you dig below the headlines, though, you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press, far ahead of the politicians. 
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. 
But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK. 
I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles. 
This is a system called TAMPER, which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be. 
But you know what, half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars. 
We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth. 
(Applause) When I was about three or four years old, I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers, and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book, to feel the picture they were discussing. 
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out. 
All these three things, then, have to be melded together. 
Then they give you 10 minutes. 
(Laughter) in this place there. 
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system." 
And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands? 
This is after a week. 
Growing living structures under an alien sky ... 
After all, we are the mouse. 
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say, dealing with electricity production, which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions. 
But now that we've been given media tools -- the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume, what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be. 
Step out. 
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food. 
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. 
I have one gram of those predatory mites. 
I brought some for her parents. 
And then I saw my own parents, my first teachers. 
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. 
Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. 
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball -- took him on his shoulder. 
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog." 
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix. 
And as I've shown here, we have the audience. 
This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring. 
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy. 
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. 
India is one of those examples. 
It's made by the company Think Fun. 
There's just kind of an ick factor there. 
Even he said that, and he would know. 
Now you may think this is just a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride, just the world's biggest stunt. 
So it's not a surreptitious technology. 
Well, at least, here at CERN. 
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing. 
And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. 
But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. 
This day, right now, has unique weather, maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again. 
Oh, that's all my time? 
Oh, some of you have seen it. 
What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason -- namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. 
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him. 
And who are waving their first books in the air, which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know? 
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here: an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left -- the world of the quantum -- and on the right the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies. 
So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet. 
The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size, and the larger the brain, the larger this difference will be. 
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant. 
Copepods are small crustaceans. 
I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration. 
So it's not just my father that I've imitated. 
(Video) CL: Mike, come on in. Mike Pope: May the force be with you. 
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing, and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. 
I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going, and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop, and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled, and fortunately, no one was hurt. 
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. 
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core. 
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. 
"My mother," she said, "My mother didn't enjoy a fight, but she was really good at them." 
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni? 
I still valued self-worth above all other worth, and what was there to suggest otherwise? 
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer." 
For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000 accessible books in Spanish. 
They spread across Africa also, of course, and there were older, earlier forms of humans there. 
It's the indication that it's the best foie gras. 
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women. 
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet. 
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "representative foreigner." 
And lo and behold, the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. 
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. 
And before long, our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins. 
You know, now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information. 
I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc. 
Thank you very much. 
This was my first sunburn. 
And so they had to cram the sign. 
Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy, and you want to do anything other than drive. 
It is a very difficult battle. 
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do. 
(Applause) So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store. 
And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child, only 400 years ago. 
And then one day, boom, we retire. 
They're on sites big, they're on sites small. 
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. 
This is work from a number of years ago, but what I'll show you next is updated science, it's updated technology. 
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. 
We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective. 
♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫ ♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫ ♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫ ♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫ ♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫ ♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫ ♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫ 
If I go out in the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface, most of the animals -- in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light. 
So I thought, even as architects, we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing. 
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers. 
Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we? 
(Laughter) (Applause) But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. 
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear? 
There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic. 
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. 
So how are we going to solve this? 
Let's do something really simple. 
I'd like to get into Android programming and development, and I'd like to continue my app club, and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. Thank you. (Applause) I made a film that was impossible to make, but I didn't know it was impossible, and that's how I was able to do it. 
People are learning more things about it. 
People say, "I was home, someone came into our village, they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs, who needs a job?'" And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. 
Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. 
But then we had to learn how to make them. 
MS: I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family. 
We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. 
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene -- and not just okay, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat. 
And also you want something that frees your eyes. 
Come here. 
This is just one example. 
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. 
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. 
Thank you. 
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank. 
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. 
So we went to the teachers. 
We started eating "freedom fries," and we started boycotting anything that was French. 
(Laughter) And Freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system, and our negative system is extremely sensitive. 
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. 
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that. 
It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's pretty simple stuff. 
So those who are suffering disproportionately don't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly, and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of the changes in the climate, the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly, and knowing how to look after their future. 
Those of you who changed your mind in favor of "for" put your hands up. 
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow. 
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco. 
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved, although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. 
And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change, change that will address this great moral challenge. 
Against my doctors' and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral. 
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways. 
We didn't fit in the normal work. We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits. 
(Laughter) Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them. 
DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. 
Do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur? 
(Applause) So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. 
And if you're a radar, that's a really bad job. 
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. 
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size. 
For example, in Saudi Arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police. 
I will be with you through the end." 
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. 
(Applause) I'm a very lucky person. 
It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and, in short to love. 
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000. 
So, let's start off in China. 
They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire. 
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet. 
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are. 
This is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science. 
Think of the implications. 
Despite having limited access to space and money, the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. 
They're searching for bush meat; forest animals they can kill to feed their families. 
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred. 
Thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him, because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night. 
She wasn't violent. 
I like eating. I like playing." 
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. 
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. 
So the wires were uninsulated. 
Someone stands up and says, "This one is important. 
But what is happening is that effectively -- and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this; lots of things haven't helped this -- business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy. 
It's a very young nation led by young people. 
(Laughter) Right. 
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. 
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply. 
So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all of the while remaining just a primate brain. 
And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff. 
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. 
I can't even name them all. 
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts. 
It's doing something that, neurologically, is remarkable. 
It was very green, it was very peppery. 
They were developed in Japan pretty recently. 
So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure, and its commercial development was stopped, and because its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published. 
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way, and 20 of them. 
You already heard about that. You know what that means. 
So this was the birth of vampire economics. 
It's an interesting fact. 
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people, when they get educated, lose it: they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. 
And I will take Kenya as an example. 
And of course, lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. 
And sure, we could find fast food chains. 
But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems. 
Now, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details. 
They're just part of being alive; we all do it. 
I've been watching, since I grew up, the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences. 
In flight, my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco-friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. 
Now for me, I'm surprised by this, because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be. 
Well, one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. 
So I was just like, well there's all kinds of coat hangers. 
It is insane what dance is right now. 
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta; she's a chick with a dick. 
Most disease is correlated with poverty, but in the case of childhood cancers, the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families. 
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. 
CA: And when do you think that will happen? 
And one of my favorites has always been, "Make love to your man in a Chevy van," because that was my vehicle when I was in college. 
The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home. 
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed, and clearly walked away from it. 
But I want to tell you a different story here today. 
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty. 
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction. 
So, to conclude, intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries, and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year, while significantly reducing global energy consumption. 
These women, many from small towns in India, help keep the peace, far away from home and family. 
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal, but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't: this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. 
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. 
And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. 
Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?" 
CA: You've got a company set up to ... 
How many say the best flute players? 
The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. 
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven. 
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson, at the Genome Institute at Washington University, who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem. 
In an interview printed in the financial press of India, He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai. 
So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. 
It turns out, all sorts of things. 
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using, and start wasting less of it? 
(Laughter) So the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade. 
So that was pretty exciting. 
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera. 
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning. 
And this brings up mentors. 
This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity. 
(Laughter) HK: He's a French robot. 
This was the worst month of my life. 
And the answer is zilch, exactly zero. 
My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells. 
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. 
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger. 
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. 
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. 
So back to Homer. 
But in fact, the majority were scared. 
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. 
It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. 
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces; we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc. 
In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization-state, rather than as a nation-state. 
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. 
On giant grass. 
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure. 
Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time. 
They were gone in an instant. 
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi. 
That illustrates that with golf, as with flutes, it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires, without grappling with the question, "What is the essential nature of the activity in question, and what qualities, what excellences connected with that activity, are worthy of honor and recognition?" 
This little syringe contains the moral molecule. 
Man 3: I'm the pet guy. 
And probably most importantly, basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. 
(Laughter) You bet. 
Quite the opposite: I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care. 
Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses. 
What do they do? 
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. 
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California. 
I put my friends in jars, I put this character, this sort of endangered species character in a blender. 
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone, and we can participate virtually, then why bother leaving the house?" 
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. 
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. 
It turned into a 24-hour contest. 
The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency, with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. 
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined. 
Okay? And then celebrities started. 
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out." 
It's an issue for young people. 
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason, and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either. 
I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: "Why didn't I go into banking?" 
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
They're easy to be re-adapted. 
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what? 
So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody, and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose. 
Can we move that up a little bit? 
This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
And they just make better decisions. 
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. 
These organisms, how are they insulating against their own electric charge? 
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
There were some conservationists, really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple, who is one of the founders of conservation biology, and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List. 
And it has a very nice acute property. 
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it, HIV. 
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before. 
I'm thrilled to be here. 
Who sees it all? 
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda. 
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize? 
And that's complexity. 
What it is now is mud, and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud, to parking lot, is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity. 
This type of leather can do what today's leather does, but with imagination, probably much more. 
That's the order of the day here. 
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center -- on social issues, we're talking about, primarily -- or conservative, and I'll give a third option, because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. 
Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category. 
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising. 
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped. 
If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed, then, because of quantum tunneling, a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time, and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. 
So, there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself. 
And on the bottom, my personal favorite, the little male over there, four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. 
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. 
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them. 
And you can see, they all follow the same line. 
If we could understand the structure of networks in villages, we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads. 
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural, beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese. 
But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society. 
Wise people know how to improvise. 
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" -- (Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote, would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet? 
And how many say, no, he doesn't? 
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective. 
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn. 
How do you get something that you can't afford? 
So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it? 
Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre, where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits, but they're not really going away. 
Daniel Kahneman: Sure. 
And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. 
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. 
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip. 
Strangely, these revelations didn't cure my low self-esteem, that feeling of otherness. 
Isn't that beautiful? 
They send him to Iraq. 
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. 
That's what we're made of. 
Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father. 
(Laughter) The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors, and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints. 
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget." 
And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements. 
Thank you. 
So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each. 
It's cells and it's wires all wired together. 
They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. 
They asked this question. 
What's new -- and it's huge -- is that, for the first time, we get to see him, and he can see us. 
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty, and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous, in fact, that one has to ask what purpose they serve. 
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it? 
The name of this track is "The Magic To Come." 
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy, as I travel around and I do autism meetings, is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids, and they just aren't very social, and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. 
There's no suggestion of a relationship there. 
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself." 
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world, where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best. 
And that showed me such a fundamental truth, that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot. 
This is over Tilamook, Oregon. 
You know, the thing is, autism comes in different degrees. 
Bill T. 
In my country, that was the case in 1974. 
We never published a paper together, but we did have a lot of fun. 
So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. 
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. 
But, what should they look like? 
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space, then the whole universe radiates. 
There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply. 
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right? 
Obviously trial and error is very important. 
They were both only children who chose not to have kids. 
Now, bad weather comes in, just land, fold up the wings, drive home. 
He coined the term "reverse fishing license." 
As of about six months ago, the state of the art in this field is that you would, for instance, go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair, and you'd say, "Steve, you're an expert on the irregular verbs. 
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could be a great communicator. 
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. 
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. 
I said, "Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm, and then do they fly 150 miles back at night? 
So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. 
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter; it was a biography. 
And what we found was this curious phenomena, that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum, making language as simple as possible, and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. 
And we invited everybody, and no press showed up. 
And this was an important thing about 19th century technology, that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart, even when judged by the most expert people. 
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule." 
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die? 
And what does that look like? 
Like this: Agricultural workers in Africa, whipped and beaten, showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. 
And I set myself and impossible target: can Tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own? 
It's how they say they care, and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying "food" in the first sentence. 
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language. 
Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. 
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object, which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football, but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn. 
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf. 
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real? 
When I was four years old, I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were. 
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms: either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action, or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war, disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion. 
They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance. 
I mean, most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them; in a month, there are about 600,000 -- most of them don't leave a trace. 
"How is that possible?" you may ask. 
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. 
There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit, very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between 35 to 70 jobs per 100 people. 
I'm going to start off by playing a video for you. 
At that point gravity wins. 
It was a hot day, and we found ourselves down by the river. 
I believe, number one, it's complacency. 
I mean, can you have rules about creativity? 
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? 
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief. 
So as he comes up from his first bow he says, "My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years? 
In Buddhism, we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front." 
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. 
Though I was attached to this ugly, unwanted, high-maintenance, mechanical pet, my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera -- very complicated, but in a good way. 
Pretty good. And at school? 
But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk. 
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty. 
This is so specific that, for example, if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem, if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example, what you get is coma or vegetative state, which is a state, of course, in which your mind disappears, your consciousness disappears. 
But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources. 
We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. 
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. 
They engineered a system that was so robust that it's still with us today, continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists. 
Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship, so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages. 
And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien. 
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. 
If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past, or Facebook of the past, we need to enlarge this space, we need to make that like a rectangle. 
(Applause) We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened. 
The proof of this came in Chile, almost a month later, when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile. 
She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder. 
That was not what was going on. 
What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier, where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy. 
All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get. 
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. 
This is a floppy disk -- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A. 
I'm going to be an elephant handler." 
The teacher only raises the question, and then stands back and admires the answer. 
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong? 
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff. 
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. 
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is, but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak, Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. 
He wasn't alone when he started. 
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around. 
(Applause) Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling, but whose streets we can't walk. 
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- "vielle à roue." 
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. 
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has 25 digits. 
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making. 
And it's a copyright violation. 
I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. 
A heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face -- 58 Gs. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. 
And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices. 
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. 
The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused, and the mouth is hanging open. 
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass. 
I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist. 
So just a month ago, on January 29th, we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event. 
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. 
And this network grew voluntarily, continues to be voluntary, and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative. 
(Applause) I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world. 
And even better, because it's an interactive application, you can tell the story for yourself. 
We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. 
What would it be like to be improving the human lot? 
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. 
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying. 
Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. 
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds, we need to construct neural maps. 
How many know him? Anybody? 
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience. 
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. 
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them. 
And the water will go where it should go. 
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment, but they are acting selfish and pathetic. 
For. 
So these are words like "teamwork" or "endurance" or even complicated concepts like "resource allocation" or "perspective," a word that they don't understand. 
What they lack is that safe space to come together, agree and move to action. 
I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. 
He actually raises money, solves my disputes. 
But that's a probabilistic statement. 
But as I began working on this project, I began changing my mind. 
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me. 
And part of that activity is honesty. 
Confused, aspiring pacifists. 
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago. 
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way. 
Why is that? 
And indeed a few years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise the smaller the detail that we can see. 
And you'll notice something about Tarawa; it is very low-lying. 
The way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden, and it's not because they need to be. 
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself. 
I felt misled. 
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. 
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars. 
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead, there may be trouble ahead, but I fear no one. I don't care. 
That's a challenge for 21st-century science. 
They didn't do this with a computer. 
Now, let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED, for the first time, on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. 
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups. 
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. 
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global. 
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting. 
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. 
What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room. 
Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time. 
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years, had top quartile teachers, the entire difference between us and Asia would go away. 
So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues. Right? 
So can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems -- say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say, "That has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons, and this is how we might simplify it"? 
That is prosperity, the saving of time in satisfying your needs. 
And this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids. 
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. 
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this, and this is the grandaddy coral. 
So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. 
I went to Turin in May. 
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing. 
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo. 
But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible. 
And you do it automatically and non-consciously. 
So I was trying to figure all that out, and I felt a little confused, and I said so on my blog, and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts, having all of the answers. And this is not true, and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling 
Okay, I'm reading that at about 75 to 25 in favor at the start. 
Foie gras and the future of cooking. 
And that's taking us to McMurdo. 
And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. 
Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him, slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page. 
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. 
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. 
We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti, but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. 
you know, we have an LDL level of 140 for a male aged 50. 
Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it." 
And this is Yuyu, who is a dancer I have been working with. 
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter) But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like, suppose it isn't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro. 
So back to the question, "Can art change the world?" 
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. 
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws. 
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. 
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves." 
And also, colors, lighting, sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having, in real time. 
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. 
But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago. 
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. 
We kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go to the cave. We were ready. 
That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world. 
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules. 
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors, such as these ones here. 
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. 
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form, and as they fuse soils, they absorb water. 
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo. 
I do not want to have my conclusions tested." 
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. 
Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. 
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six. 
(Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, "Forget that." 
This thing was made of resin and it was too light. 
So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area, and use that height that we have to have for its function. 
And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform. 
(Laughter) Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. 
As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady. 
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire. 
And so these are the things we will try to do in the lab, make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life. 
Instead, everything we touched we killed. 
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting? 
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. 
Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city. 
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring. 
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear. 
I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. 
That's the only space she could express her creativity. 
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light. 
When I was a young man, a young biologist in Africa, I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. 
And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched. 
One last example from this data: Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. 
And I think it really summarizes where we are here. 
A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. 
We think that might have something to do with Reagan. 
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone? 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. 
So, you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. 
And it was that bias that was determining their outcome. 
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch, Ratan is taller than me, and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. 
And they want to do their design by simulation. 
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!" 
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nano-structured, one thing that's fascinating, is when a male and a female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material. 
This is quite comforting for people like me -- I'm a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation. 
And this one in the middle here, the large truck, is actually called the Active Denial System -- something the U.S. military is working on at the moment. 
We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense, except, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat. 
Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park. 
Interestingly, data is relationships. 
At all. 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. 
My mother carefully opened the door, and she loaded the laundry into the machine, like this. 
I'm proposing three planks. 
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. 
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. 
On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole. 
And it's a pretty big building. 
The collapse in biodiversity, climate change, pandemics, financial crises: these will be the currency that we will think about. 
To my surprise, it did not correlate. 
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy. 
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s. 
So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. 
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time. 
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line. 
The thought that you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly, no one ever thought of that. 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. 
We also brought new designs to the street. 
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so, science has kind of blurred this distinction between non-living and living systems, and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. 
That was the surprise of going across the river, of going on the highway around it, of walking down the street and finding it. 
We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically, socially and environmentally. 
Now the challenge for all of us is: how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right? 
Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. 
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken; what's called the "cold chain" gets broken. 
Instead, so far, the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena. 
So we basically turned the box into a bubble. 
And it's just clever. 
We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn't possible. 
This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby, there's no problem with this visual. 
What we have to look at is at how we feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. 
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals -- But the exchange of one object for another never happens. 
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. 
But if you look at the blue data points, which is mechanically ventilated air, it's not as diverse. 
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising, super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet. 
Because every generation thinks we are the final one. 
Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year, some experience you could share within a group. 
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. 
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable. 
It would be terrible. 
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes, and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. 
So this stuff is just beginning. 
Study after study is coming to the same conclusion. 
She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together. 
But each and every one one of you has the potential to change that. 
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise, because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. 
I work with children all over the world, and that's an entirely different talk, but I want to leave you with one story that really, really inspired me. 
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable. 
What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life, whether it's your work life or your business life? 
So let's take one problem that families face, crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help. 
We have thousands of organisms that can do this. 
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars, and that translates to "aru meen," which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. 
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. 
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer, and there's no sign of this pace slowing. 
(Laughter) Someone made an old timey version. 
And this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue, and it's being cut. 
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. 
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see. 
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this, which I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or: There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner 
I went to this village for the first time. 
And over time, these neural pathways become hardwired, they become the norm -- even if it's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety. 
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples. 
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles, and Noora, the one that can use light, are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated. 
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. 
The term "deep six" comes to mind: "If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill, deep six it!" 
It's even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan. 
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. 
Free is probably the most interesting thing. 
My son's birth is on this camera. 
He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink. 
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone, to find the nearest AED which can save lives. 
You must have taken tea in the morning. 
He really popped their balloon. 
Now why would you use rats? 
You would be wrong. 
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable? 
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit, and our former prime minister came, so they helped us to collect money, and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium. 
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T. 
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride. 
Again, like I said, my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell, and also making them for myself, obtaining them, appreciating them and diving into them. 
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes. 
This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. 
On the left is the heart rate showing biology. 
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. 
We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the Big Bang. 
The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors -- is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the Internet of things. 
2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists? 
But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it. 
Thank you for listening. 
Thank you. 
So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components, put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface, will actually spend five minutes here, 10 minutes there, clicking. After six months, 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote, "practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.," once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. 
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. 
You operate the world as you operate the real world, which is to say, with your hands. 
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses. 
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore. 
And I thought it was so fantastic. 
What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do, whether we should use that guy's data or not? 
It doesn't work that way. 
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people, endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people, putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others, and this is because of human ego, human greed. 
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. 
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. 
Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country? 
But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth, when it all came together. 
Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists. 
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan -- they don't need to see the video; they see it every day. 
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience. 
The key thing is that for it to work, there has to be interpersonal influence. 
Thanks so much, Chris. CU: Thank you. (Applause) So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit. 
I think of meditation. 
So now, how to choose the metals? 
We observe the cells in a plate, and they're just on the surface. 
(Applause) Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem? 
So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work. 
It doesn't always mean plot or fact. 
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene, deescalate it, show victims a safe way out. 
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP. 
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen. 
And so what they found, in fact, is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans. 
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need. 
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. 
I was injured all my life, and then in my early 40s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too. 
And of course, from here, we can go and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at? 
And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. 
Our standard see-through patient. 
For example, New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. 
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum, he got this one wrong. 
At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan. 
So we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things. 
If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place. 
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it." 
It did this a thousand years ago. 
If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
They really make Inside Out their own project. 
We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire, how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea, how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time, controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south. 
And then someone goes off and saves the world because they've been told to, with a few people tagging along. 
And after about five years of doing this, I was arrested for kidnapping. 
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. 
It's the same with institutions. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. 
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers, and I myself, I'm not going to give you many answers today, just ask a lot of questions. 
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985, when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply. 
(Applause) So, this is my grandfather, Salman Schocken, who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed, and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table. 
And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored. 
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering. 
(Music) (Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January. 
A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance. 
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place, but I promise there is good news. 
And Feynman's eyes just opened up. 
Thank you. 
Our special is tracking cookie. 
Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off. 
In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college. 
There was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of. 
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village. 
These are very dirty little protocells, as a matter of fact. (Laughter) But they have lifelike properties, is the point. 
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans, not just to a particular flavor of soda, but to a particular brand. 
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born. 
And you watch the news, you pay attention, you read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends, and you read the newspapers from around the world. 
The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct" makes the case that, "The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation." 
It's an ongoing process your whole life. 
What is the ideal balance of human and machine? 
They have parochial interests. 
We do need to really start trying. 
One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world. 
I was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?" 
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. 
You can come back to Earth. 
We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. 
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back. 
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years. 
This may be surprising. 
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are. 
And then this is Anthony. 
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story." 
Throughout her time there, she was strong, she was steadfast. 
So there goes my theory of necrophilia. 
Thank you very much. 
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. 
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. 
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. 
(Laughter) It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified. 
I mean, we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education, holding these press conferences, which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there. 
You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system, create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing, which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner. 
As I became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now. 
I call it cognitive surplus. 
Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle, which is, using pictures to represent words. 
You may discover, as I did, that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault, a lot of things you used to think about yourself, really had nothing to do with you. 
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of: the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally. 
For a while there the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter, the global short messaging service -- nine of the top 10 links were about the quake. 
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter) [Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. 
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it. 
Because it looks like it might. 
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it. 
Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost to connect within Africa. 
And while, of course, we do need clean energy, I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem, we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it. 
And some people will get people to be on the other team. 
And with absolute difference -- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position, where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter, and everybody outside Africa has another letter. 
But how did it actually run this show? 
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality. 
And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders, go beyond our conflicts and work together. 
And at each time, I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. 
Let's go for it, and while we're about it, let's have a bit of fun, for us, for the students and for TED here. 
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving. 
So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out. 
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can." 
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections. 
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. 
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. 
You will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not. 
And then finally, to show that some of the differences between people, in how we judge others, can be explained by differences in this brain system. 
And we had progress in the free media. 
Look at that. 
But it turns out this is just a reminder that, although this is a lot of fun, when you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful, and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. 
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery. 
(Laughter) Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. 
You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing, and a lot of light and dark comes into it. 
That you're much better off, almost universally, looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. 
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs, Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed, and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain. 
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain, and this is Matahari, her second son, which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy. 
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers. 
And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. 
In the United States, North America, much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ... 
(Laughter) OK. 
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside, carrying with it sediments from the construction site, smothering the coral and killing it. 
When you're pre-immunized, what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes. 
They also have an estimate of around a billion. 
Invest. 
So this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences. 
So at the end of it, we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own, irrespective of who or where they were. 
Isn't there something shorter? 
And within just a couple years, San Francisco became the first no-kill city, running no deficit, completely supported by the community. 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. 
In this time, it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. 
He's not open source, but it's very, very powerful. 
It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. 
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day. 
And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. 
Again, it's got technology -- it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head. 
But this is it. 
So all the way over on the left of this graph, what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year, and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year. 
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. 
We still haven't heard anything. 
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in -- Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting, which is where we kind of have to be. 
We'll see what happens when we play with this palette. 
Well, some really nice little tricks. 
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning. 
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes, sometime in the early 1900s. 
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product. 
It's a primitive conifer. 
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food, and they have to keep moving, and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants, while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil, as we see where a herd has passed. 
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005. 
It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites. 
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter: particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei. 
A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. 
Slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today. 
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. 
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life, all sorts of backgrounds. 
The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support, empowering communities to look after their own children. 
(Laughter) No comment. 
Now we're in tough times economically. 
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold. 
So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on. 
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. 
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. 
These seem to be natural human aspirations. 
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones, you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. 
And they do what we've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand -- which is that they give them a name and a story. 
That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country. 
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk? 
The second, more honest way is to actually fix the model. 
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in. 
The green movement significantly inspired the world. 
Can you feel the rage? 
Forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010. 
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around. 
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government, probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. 
Wham! It hits me by my right leg. 
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? 
So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it, maybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better. 
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second. 
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement? 
And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. 
FG: Yeah. 
We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed. 
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. 
I'm really blessed to be a parent, and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way, and you don't have any say about it, and there's no changing it. 
And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion. 
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent. 
May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share, if they want to, by themselves or with others, because property is one mechanism of coordination. 
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to. 
(Laughter) I skied on for a week past the Pole. 
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as "sell or starve:" Sign the paper, or no food for your tribe. 
This is all the press we got, and we said, it's time to celebrate. 
The telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground, telescopes with different wavelength capability, telescopes even that are similar, but different instruments -- they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. 
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not. 
(Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful. 
He solves my problems in the village. 
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? — he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was, you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard. 
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths. 
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
And so, they're joining China, whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been both defensive and offensive. 
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch. 
You can work to change your relationship to your past. 
This is pretty incredible stuff. 
So he sat down -- and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -- and he tried to write down, and did write down, the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. 
There are more neuromodulators that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure, and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns. 
Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. 
And my chest ached. 
So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. 
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. 
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it. 
What's next? 
Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea, but this task, as Bruno mentioned, isn't an easy one for two main reasons: First, the detection algorithms. 
And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country. 
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away, and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly, which is explicable, because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses, but you can learn how to cope with them. 
Containerization has made it very efficient. 
Then when the photo left, the frame was still there. 
There's also neo-biological design, where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. 
Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with? 
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins, diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. 
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so. 
And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships, your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. 
(Laughter) I thought it was very indecent of Accenture to ditch Tiger Woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way. 
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover. 
Microscopy for 1,800 patients. 
It's just been industrial, which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph, and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe. 
Then another school said, "Well, what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?" 
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way, as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers. 
And these are base stations. 
Life was pretty good. 
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night." 
Let's just take a few examples. 
In 2008, Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days -- from conception to two years old -- does not have adequate nutrition, the damage is irreversible. 
This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine, and Mohamed Atta's last day began." 
In biology, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us? 
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills, it worked out pretty well, didn't it? 
Many people, I think, on our planet right now despair, and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. 
This is for real. 
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect, which is a very old idea in the social sciences, going back 150 years, known as "dying of a broken heart." 
I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil. 
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. 
Or should we use something else? 
The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end. 
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her number-one pick. 
He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri. 
I wanted that wish to actually start now. 
What do people think about it? 
They are more expensive in places like North America. 
So here's little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns. 
I study monarchs because they get sick. 
And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise. 
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye. 
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. 
Basit and Amjad; they are still there. 
(Applause) (Laughter) I think I might have actually heard more hands. 
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. 
Instead, they've become, sadly, uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing, pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. 
And it's very important to have political reforms, to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. 
Here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs, or urban agriculture. 
Actually they were an education for participation, for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens. 
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick. 
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. 
Those sold for two dollars each. 
I was on a three-month road trip this summer. 
So race, class, gender, ability, all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. 
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And, but we were still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is: How do you nature-nurture? 
And to understand why, we must look at how, through the ages, military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace. 
First, it allows us to showcase our Arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, New York City. 
I'm like, "What are you doing here?" 
We think we have a problem of people saving too much. 
(Audience: Yes.) Good. 
But not when they're together like that. 
They have a hut that has no electricity, no running water, no wristwatch, no bicycle. 
It's very clear that this is what happens. 
We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. 
And it's investments, not donations, not loans, but investments that have a dynamic return. 
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. 
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material, as an organism must, for the maximum amount of strength. 
I do not remember what time it was. 
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale. 
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products. 
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. 
It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. 
The same is true of globalization. 
But if he were here -- (Laughter) he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography, that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey -- a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades. 
If one member trespasses the agreement, and does cut down trees, the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him. 
And we need to revive that spirit. 
They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved." 
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. 
But it needs to be done long-term. 
So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools. 
This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. 
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. 
RSW: This is the computer building? 
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak, just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee, as you see in the other image -- and having a paste graft to that knee. 
A. And you have an immediate appreciation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network. 
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do. 
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem." 
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible. 
(Laughter) Now I've been talking so far about pleasure, but what I want to suggest is that everything I've said applies as well to pain. 
And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. 
So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. 
And Einstein said -- and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that "these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge." 
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds. 
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land. 
Now she thinks the powder is sugar. 
And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon, which is going to be pretty fun. 
(Applause) Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. 
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years. 
So therefore, we get a lot of complaints every single week -- complaints including one we get very often, which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage," celebrates the idea of vivisection. 
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. 
Oars are your only means of propulsion. 
Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. 
Stay-at-home moms. Right? 
But because they're a U.N. operation, maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them. 
So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration. 
And you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous. 
Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years. 
Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it. 
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something. 
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. 
After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. 
At least they patented something which, you know, could do useful things. 
And so this function of emotions suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve, they're a kind of primitive form of communication. 
What if there were a pure form of justice? 
The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. 
In Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021. 
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly, to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons. 
Thank you. 
And I'm going to start with some of our own experience. 
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years. 
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility. 
Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. 
(Laughter) SW: What about a skunk? 
The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong. 
Are they so different? 
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is. 
I'm not saying it's easy. 
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies. 
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees. 
And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. 
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer. 
And this picture was taken by ATLAS. 
Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? 
There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built. 
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution. 
Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object -- that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time. 
I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. 
It's called "Fashion Statement," and there are quotes about fashion, so you can read it, and also, because the definition of artist book is very generous. 
And especially the small reactors need to go forward. 
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina, which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. 
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off. 
(Applause) I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses. 
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight, and it fills the middle portion of the fly, so when a fly hits your windshield, it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at. 
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. 
And I looked at India and said, really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
We are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world, and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage. 
What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it? 
But it brought in so many people -- teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody -- because it was street level. It was open to the public. 
It's a children's book for the iPad. 
Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment, promote trade. 
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do. 
Next, we need proper science, proper evidence. 
But the companies withheld that data from them, and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years. 
So, how do you make education better? 
In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side. 
So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. 
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. 
This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate; this is me being a parent. 
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. 
Seventy percent of the population didn't want this. 
You have that much uncertainty. 
He became a recluse. 
So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized. 
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes. 
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel. 
If you don't think that way, well, you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy, because the tidy idea, you know, people criticized it. 
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. 
And they are public places, but that are managed by private companies. 
But play's a shapeshifter. 
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. 
Open source software, these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection. 
And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. 
I asked them all. 
And one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search. 
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone. 
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants. 
He gave us a new perspective on life." 
(Applause) You will understand nothing with my type of English. 
It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. 
I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi, 14 years ago. 
But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today. 
Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. 
And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. 
And we want to be the first one to create it, Chris. 
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children. 
And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals, so that they could produce milk and whatnot, like we had in the Biosphere. 
If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media? 
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round. 
It wastes the body, but the mind remains intact. 
Nathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. 
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico. 
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. 
Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age. 
So what will happen now is quite straightforward. 
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"? 
that the less-frequent "arghs" are, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating -- except, oddly, in the early 80s. 
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. 
Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity. 
So this is where we are, but we have a long row to hoe. 
And that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down, and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out. 
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient, and only one of them died. 
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say is actually far nicer, and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out. 
The economy is mostly agricultural. 
We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. 
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs. 
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 
And only this little bit, only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop. 
JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram, and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead, although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. 
We can also see blooms of bacteria, blooms of viruses in the ocean. 
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities. 
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences. 
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. 
And they immediately said to me, "Well you are describing a classic ritual." 
We do have artists, but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet. 
(Laughter) "I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out. 
Thank you very much. 
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find? 
You're either in love, or you're not in love. 
How do you solve this problem? 
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn't lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades. 
And so we expect -- it's not much fun. 
In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. 
Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way -- a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. 
Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for. 
I might still be in the green list, but I'm not doing myself, or you, or the oceans any favors. 
Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. 
But if India grows at something like eight percent, income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050. 
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter. 
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. 
These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. 
Okay, a bit more. 
Have you ever been involved in a conversation, and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting? (Laughter) So you're nodding and you're smiling, but you're really paying attention to this one over here, until you hear that last word go up, and you realize, you've been asked a question. (Laughter) And you're really hoping the answer is no, because that's what you're about to say. 
In that hospice, there were 31 men and women who were actively dying. 
I know that I'm not my body, and I also know that you're not yours. 
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that. 
So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better. 
So here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently: divorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee. 
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al," and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this. 
False. 
Our thinking is backwards. 
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds. 
Now actually, in 1993, the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study, published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community, in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was never published; it's now a good example of publication bias. 
But some locations draw you back time and time again. 
Same thing with every single password and so on. 
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays. 
(Applause) And I have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom. 
or Roger 2.0. 
He was waiting. 
Country 2, that has fewer telephones, is China. 
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System. 
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. 
Now, because I know -- (Applause) -- OK, I assume that answers my question. 
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier. 
(Laughter) This is a very different demographic. 
I thought so. 
By working together, we can create peace one day. 
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table, you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away, and it seems to keep getting irritated. 
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work, and his early work had a resemblance to my early work. 
The HIV epidemic peaked. 
And there are a couple of answers to that question. 
(Applause) I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. 
Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty-making. 
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days. 
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious. 
Well, I think we've found its secret: It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule 30 or like this. 
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. 
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. 
With this event, a new era in Native American history began. 
But is it practical? 
And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result. 
BR: So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles, wasted energy, and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna, or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place, with local, organic produce; so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin. 
The only bit of ice I could find -- it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -- was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis. 
And that moment is right now, and those moments are counting down, and those moments are always, always, always fleeting. 
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. 
And we've got such a long way to go with this. 
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down, we realized that we had a cathedral, a cathedral to green, and a cathedral to green education. 
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. 
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe, like a hurricane, it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery, but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that. 
Well, it’s the relative importance. 
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel, that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. 
(Laughter) (Applause) How often do we hear that people just don't care? 
I was so proud. 
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. 
And last year, our population grew by 80 million. 
There's plenty of parental authority going on. 
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row. 
(Laughter) But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s, where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. 
That's physical activity. 
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. 
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs, poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair, and she sat there, kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs, checked the list, made themselves breakfast, checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher, rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had, checked the list once more, gathered their belongings, and made their way to the bus. 
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun. 
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way, those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics. 
And this is the terrain it appears over, and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. 
So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person. 
And I went through a mental exercise actually, because I started a patient support community of my own on a website, and one of my friends, one of my relatives actually, said, "Look, Dave, who grew this thing? 
I was frightened. We were frightened. 
And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. 
On this map, green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated. 
And I think a lot of people in this room, I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself. 
So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. 
In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums. 
I strive for authenticity, even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. 
There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. 
He wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early. 
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin, and they are destitute, like these young men in the image. 
I mean, who knows, right? 
Unfortunately I couldn't go. 
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations. 
We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch, and end up as second class citizens. 
All right, you've all heard the term: "He's a born surgeon." 
It's the most important map of all. 
It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. 
So it's not only about the system, it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say. 
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland. 
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. 
Human beings are very motivated by the "now." 
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously, I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi, one of my heroes and mentors really, he managed to get UNICEF involved. 
And then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth. 
The consumer society is what you need for the Industrial Revolution to have a point. 
They were asking for democracy; they were asking for freedom. 
I wouldn't know. 
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit. 
But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. 
(Applause) I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause) Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy. 
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true for anything that is creative. 
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. 
Then the city grows around it. 
It's the only gift that you have right now, and the only appropriate response is gratefulness. 
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887, he called them radio waves because they radiated. 
Now how do we cope and deal with that? 
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. 
If you read a book, pull things up. 
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region. 
If we invest about 12 billion dollars, we could make a severe inroad into that problem. 
In order to operate, this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer. 
So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. 
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind, and it helps the sentence to feel right. 
And compassion does seek physicality. 
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. 
And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. 
It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. 
Like even people in convenience stores saying, "Have a nice day," when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. 
I fainted and landed on it, and it broke. 
So what you see, that precipice, that high precipice with the valley, is the 2008 financial crisis. 
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here, but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know, keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate, plenty of real estate in the universe, and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle, and I know you like to think you're a miracle, but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong, so probably not the case. 
And the bigger your gesture gets, the more ill-defined, blurry and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra. 
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network: that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language. 
(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. 
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. 
And each possible rule, in a sense, corresponds to a candidate universe. 
And finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. 
He was one of the members. The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins? 
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. 
Remarkably, the answer is yes. 
(Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. 
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. 
It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today. 
They're under threat because of changing climate. 
He's learning about how to keep a fire going. 
In 1993, there was a table at the conference in Seattle, and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web. 
I built this in my garage. 
And it's specifically algorithms, which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. 
This is horrifying. 
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites; I figured, no problem. 
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. 
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you, or you can actually choose to interact with it. 
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. 
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. 
So, if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case, in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism. 
If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard? 
I didn't. 
I mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. 
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. 
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort, is a kind of validation, a sense of being seen. 
These guys down on Wall Street, Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation, they're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel. 
(Laughter) Except maybe French people. 
I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign. 
An almost identical structure. 
The story of this little girl: She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months. 
Don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs. 
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea. 
Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run. 
Everybody applauded politely. 
And that gap continues to widen. 
Three main approaches. 
But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here? 
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish. 
But the novelty is here. 
And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said, "Oh, we really need a new concept." 
It's not just inappropriate, it becomes really unsafe. 
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. 
And the first mate hesitates. 
I will meet you there. 
Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. 
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them a mechanism that self-updates. 
Recently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love. 
Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
There's a receiver. 
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on. 
We couldn't go to all the slums, but we tried to cover as much as we could. 
Well, the fact of the matter is, look at this person in 1956, and this is when texting doesn't exist, "I Love Lucy" is still on the air. 
Well, how could it have? 
It is also unstable. 
And if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do. 
That's the footprint that is always being confused. 
CA: And releasing this caused widespread outrage. 
I learned to be always there. 
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded. 
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. 
But, you know, I find reading with machines a very lonely process. 
And there isn't always a translator available. 
Whatever. I don't know." 
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year." 
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything. 
That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view, with twice the amount of CO2 in the air. 
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had, and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named the number one artist influence at the time. 
Think back when you were just a kid. 
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted. 
Why did they create a system like that? 
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats, we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change. 
The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease." 
Call this naive if you like. 
So they had created these artifacts. 
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head, I realized that it held the best and the worst of us. 
Well, we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) — and we hope once it's there, you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there, and what we're about to do. 
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper. 
Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person -- has become programmed, electronic and virtual. 
And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo, they're us, we're the people getting policed. 
That song -- (Applause) Thank you. 
Tesla's insight was profound. 
Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. 
Now, in economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis. 
And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. 
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. 
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. 
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys. 
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship. 
Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side -- bringing peace to Northern Ireland. 
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion. 
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. 
All of these things are happening in plain sight, and they're all protected by a force field of tediousness. 
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer, how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test? 
We couldn't do them without technology. 
So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. 
You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings. 
And in order to adopt a fresh perspective, I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage. 
They downloaded it from Disney.com, or one of these websites, 14 days after putting the computer in their village. 
And even light could not escape this current. 
And so look at her. 
They are training themselves, as many young animals do, to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. 
This was a fly by wire. It has wings. 
And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them, and I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool?" 
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different." 
Let me show you one of my favorites. 
But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You, where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. 
I thought, oh my gosh. 
And when they do all of that for about five years, they get the coveted board certification. 
How does this work? Well, two ways. 
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. 
If I have a painting of a facade, I can consider it's not just that particular building, but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information. 
But now, in our third acts, it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time. 
Last year, his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region. 
As you know, an animation is a series of images. 
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts. 
And let me tell you why I have that perspective. 
He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. 
All of my work begins very simple. 
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys. 
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another. 
The manufacturer said, "What would it take for you to cut one in half?" 
I have a couple of units. 
And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. 
I will not kill for you. 
UE: Nope. It's just smoke. 
We take the sand, we mix it with clay, and we keep building. 
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map. 
He's a unicyclist. 
Now here comes the radical experiment. 
These are normal cells. 
(Laughter) This model requires you to act like the king, like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back. 
You know, it looks at economic power measured by GDP. 
The comments began pouring in, and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them. 
Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America, you click the "I want it in Spanish" button and out it comes in real time in Spanish. 
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it. 
Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end, and they place it on the table, they actually spin it. 
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number. 
How many people knew of Lula before today? 
Why? 
Politicians have recently begun Twittering. 
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. 
Back on land, Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa, where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals, the main parts having already been sent to Europe. 
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. 
Now as our light is red, the cyclist's light has turned yellow already, and if you squint, you can see that in the imagery. 
But most of all, the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. 
And then that year, that year, 2008, this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th: "General Stanley McChrystal, commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan, announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September." 
When the second group of children came in, they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams, but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with. 
We need to catalog it. It's a library of life, but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it. 
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for 250 years has been their British identity. 
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall. 
So Attitude: Look, we're all going to get lumps, and we're all going to get bumps. 
A human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds! 
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave. 
You go places you've dreamt about. 
And indeed that's exactly what stars do. 
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues. 
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. 
and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe," and have it tell us. 
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again." 
The other objections, I think, that are important to say, is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice. 
And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA. 
That's what it feels like to me. 
This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. 
To Svalbard, in fact. 
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. 
And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got. 
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. 
You've got two options. 
It's a children's book about Indian independence -- very patriotic. 
And let's see how this one works. 
So if we go and look at this piece of content, President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago, and look at what we find in this same data set, at the same scale, the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. 
(Laughter) In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook. 
Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged, as shown on the left. 
(Applause) When I was 14 years old, I was interested in science -- fascinated by it, excited to learn about it. 
As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. 
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them. 
With ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. 
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy 35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment, where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor. 
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. 
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting: because you can see the best, everyone can learn. 
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. 
But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities, we talk about a gathering of people. 
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance? 
You see, I, Sam Richards, I know who these guys are. 
We're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that. 
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of what we did, a lot of the secret of our success, was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement. 
I understand how this could happen. 
Here's what had to happen. 
It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence, which then makes you very, very successful in later life. 
(Laughter) "That's cool." 
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before. 
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron, the building blocks of planets and of life. 
And so the net effect of all 250 of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for. 
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. 
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. 
Well, obviously, when people die in the war, they are Muslims, they are Iraqis -- they're not Americans. 
And they're out there! 
Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future? 
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. 
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain, because that's all there was to look at. 
And that's what makes computers powerful: these high-level languages that can be compiled. 
That three-year-old girl is still part of you. 
And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations. 
(Laughter) CA: What's on your mind? 
So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question. 
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. 
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs, but actually -- well, I am a little bit -- but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. 
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either. 
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. 
So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken. 
(Laughter) Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design. 
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stock broker already. 
He's actually taking his own picture, shot with what's called a camera trap. 
And this is my scariest. (Laughter) I don't have a good answer for this one. 
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. 
So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of "digital humanists" that are going to be ready for this shift. 
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. 
Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist, they made her think and think and think again. 
And we have new tools. 
And my hat's off to you in Kibera. 
And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion. 
We like it. We like some parts of it. 
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see. 
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless. 
And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they're deciding what to do, when they're making action choices. 
Now, this woman lived in a village in Nepal. 
I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping. 
They're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning what other people should do, planning their life for them. 
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract. 
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism. 
You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's. 
This is the field of biologic replacements, where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones. 
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question, "Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter) I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter) That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is, these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people on the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter) It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO, he explains that design must get big, and he's right. 
(Whistling) (Applause) Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion [of] Whistling. 
It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer, and just requires phenomenal grunt. 
That is to say, it creates people who only do things for incentives. 
It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. 
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image. 
And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. 
That was like, we considered that super cool. 
If you see the word "microfinance," what comes to mind? 
And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. 
Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me -- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very -- you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody, everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example, is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City. 
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American. 
When their kids were five and two, Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. 
And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really. 
He ran his trial. 
Because this is treating your audience like a moron. 
So what does that mean? 
Real-time data turns on the lights. 
And finally, lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country. 
You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really, you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say, "You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy," and they're going to hoot you off the stage. 
The system measures the beam's time of flight, recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return. 
What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel." 
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice." 
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto, and they settled into a new life. 
Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha, with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. 
So under that basis, we put it out and said, "Look, we're skeptical about this thing. 
So right there is the tutoring center, and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices, where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that. 
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. 
But the truth is life is being lived there. 
Thanks. 
Open it up. 
Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles. 
The first attempt didn't go so well. 
He did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!" 
So if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons, what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel? 
There was another unusual boat out there at the same time, doing as I was doing, bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch, that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas, with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it, circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre. 
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic. 
It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs, the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny, give place to parliaments where laws are made, and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained. 
So Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater. 
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane -- the materials that help us, when we're hit like this, not to hurt ourselves too much. 
They are over 2,000 years old. 
What if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years, because that's true, too. 
Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here, so please ignore me. 
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates, they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money. 
And then we reverse the current. 
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy." 
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. 
And therefore, the standard process, where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men, are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent. 
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being, but when they're happy they look beautiful. 
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence. 
Yemenis are using cartoons and art, paintings, comics, to tell the world and each other about what's going on. 
And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults. 
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors, but I never have the decency to honor their names. 
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that. 
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters, such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year's floods. 
And then once you have that problem solved, the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction. 
We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff. 
And in one of our labs, Jack Szostak's labs, it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets, on certain types of planets like the Earth, where you have some liquid water and some clays -- you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. 
He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. 
Well obviously this is a replica. 
We need active system. 
The second thing I'd like to talk about: If you were living in a remote village somewhere, your child was limp, and you were in a drought, or you were in floods, or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet, what would you do? 
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left, ninja-clad bike messenger. 
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker. 
But it's not dinosaur DNA. 
(Laughter) And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication. 
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts. 
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. 
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie, and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. 
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. 
And I said, "What do I do?" 
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, which has left more than 200,000 people dead, thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. 
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan? 
(Applause) Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.) LP: A quick question for you. 
It's about time. End sequence. Take one. 
On his last job he was working with his boss, and they started pouring the columns wrong. 
(Laughter) We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back. 
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, "Who's there?" 
And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered. 
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity." 
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing." 
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. 
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. 
Commendable: a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do -- like tying their shoes. 
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968. 
Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think Google Maps, think GPS -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation. 
When I spoke to the -- my project management team, they said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous. 
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through 900 meters of water and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor. 
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning. 
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding. 
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. 
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. 
You have to remember that this is not a real island. 
And at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join." 
With neutral, there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. 
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use, we waste nine. 
So that's all I'm going to say about that. 
(Applause) It'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way, if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight -- (Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause) SP: You've got it! You've got the job. 
And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. 
The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white. 
So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. 
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia, which are the equivalent of plant roots. 
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want. 
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it. 
(Applause) One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. 
And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. 
He lost purpose. He lost his community. 
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. 
A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded, someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs. 
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems. 
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." 
It's done very well. I love this puzzle. 
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. 
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. 
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero, that just breaks you in so many ways. 
And it's not just in terms of sex. 
When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs. 
A study published last year found that from birth, from the moment of birth, babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language. 
And yet despite this, hardly any of us have ever heard space. 
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models, we will be able to see the future. 
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, "Hey guy, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?" 
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this." 
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues, the ongoing conflict in Darfur, escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. 
But it's a technology so pervasive, so invisible, that we, for a long time, forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. 
If you want to keep going, if you want to change the camera angle, you can do that, and because of that, I can show you that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn. 
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive. 
It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up. 
And one of the envelopes had things in it that said, "By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself." 
But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. 
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change.

MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story. 
And I wondered, what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places, where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms?

Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures. 
This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete. 
Decades after the "Hunger Winter," researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity, more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.

Evan Grant: Let's do "pull." 
They've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. 
Compassion is a worthy successor. 
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before? 
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. 
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know? 
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. 
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India. 
(Laughter) But nine of the 10 in those first hours. 
This is very promising. 
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. 
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum, which is there for us to use. 
There is a dearth of old stars. 
This brings me to the third, and perhaps most problematic, assumption: "You must never say no to choice." 
(Applause) I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. 
And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard. 
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball, and this ball they roll away from the dung source, usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source, and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls. 
They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. 
Now, our data processing on this is still preliminary, but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive. 
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules. 
We've got what's rational for public health. 
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck. 
And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously.

China, women run 20 percent of all small businesses. 
I had been growing all my own food. 
(Music) What's amazing about this is, if the processional of the wedding was this much fun, can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?

The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me. 
One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. 
Why? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way. 
But in fact, that question "Is it still ethical?" 
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that, guaranteed, I am inspired -- I am inspired by the person I am listening to. 
Now, headline writers had a field day with our studies. 
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. 
Next week, with raisins."

Thank you. 
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... 
We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon. 
And then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages. 
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. 
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime. 
I built that pier with my bare hands. 
It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. 
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments. 
Because liberals reject three of these foundations. 
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge. 
for the Cassini mission. 
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual. 
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
So if you have a container, it's like getting in your car.

It's a promise. 
Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. 
They say, "You know what you smell? 
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And "God"? 
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process. 
So, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something, or other patients have been diagnosed, and all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay. 
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it? 
And people told me -- like these 36 views of the Empire State building -- they told me, "You're making artist books." 
We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other -- billions of each other. 
Here we'll just create, in this line, a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. 
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project. 
So to do that, we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and, of course, smart delivery methods. 
It grows and is nurtured. 
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon, but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets, and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto, the body formerly known as a planet. 
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. 
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts, but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body, shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way? 
About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. 
She's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her, who's able to listen to the audience, and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another. 
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads. 
(Laughter) A lion having a late night snack -- notice he's got a broken tooth. 
And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was. 
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator. 
Just shout it out. 
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. 
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. 
Another three years. 
I say that, for thousands of years, women have lived, exemplified, met in intimacy, the archetype of Avalokitesvara, of Kuan-Yin, she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. 
On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network, which is very important; people really love social networking. 
I may be an [odd] student with unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you. 
Thank you. 
But there were also revelations. 
I don't get it. 
(Laughter) So let's take [an] example, actually. 
So at that point we knew that it was cancer. 
So what are jobs going to be like? 
Everybody thought is was finished. 
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy. 
We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. 
Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. 
When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box, we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps. 
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting, and we had voted to work on overreacting. 
Could you go the other way? 
The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups. 
When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism? 
Well, let me first back up for a moment.

And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood, like in Morrisania, about the jazz history. 
And I think that, if anybody in here runs -- and I just had a conversation with Carol; we talked for two minutes backstage, and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. 
They were maturing at five centimeters. 
It's the ideas. 
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently. 
People go one, two, three, four, tear. 
And this is, in my opinion, an example of soft power, because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. 
And yet, of course, that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. 
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. 
Who here has had surgery? 
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time. 
When? 
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time. 
That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone. 
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human.

Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer. 
Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: "Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice." 
It's very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people, you split them in half, you treat one group one way, you treat the other group the other way, and a little while later, you follow them up and see what happened to each of them. 
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around. 
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that. 
You know, that's the strength of our argument, that we are doing something that's truly different. 
That's a 50 percent deflation rate. 
And their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not. 
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively. 
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. 
Now if you don't have power, or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of surgery, this machine transitions automatically, without even having to touch it, to drawing in room air from this inlet. 
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person? 
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you. 
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about. 
And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn't be kidnapped or killed. 
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. 
We call that the pizza. 
This was one of the groups. 
How do you not despair when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy, climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture, that to someone like me who could dance for three hours? 
I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. 
Quick example from the corporate world. 
I made the battery all liquid -- liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte. 
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. 
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation. 
Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now, because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now, almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. 
Well, she was shocked. 
I received and email and it said, "Hi, I'm Ray. 
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. 
And the under-reading was women aren't worth it. 
And we know that most of them are dead. 
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES. 
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there, pushing him in, those turned up jeans. 
And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. 
She's in the studio with him for a long time. 
They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. 
20 percent of the Council. (Applause) The same time, finally, that Council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February. 
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it? 
Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes, great successes. 
What we found is that in very remote areas, these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. 
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals, so it's unobtrusive. 
The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story. 
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence, the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout. 
And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G20 is really important.

My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. 
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. 
We try to make big, permanent, important change. 
And she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which, in a business context or a government context, would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing. 
(Laughter) But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1 (2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers. 
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention -- they go home, they're finished. They don't stall. 
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle, plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. 
(Applause) My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago. 
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing, by dying, but they don't. 
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. 
Like Philip Roth, who said, "And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people? 
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube. 
It strips that gas cloud apart. 
Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation -- for reaching agreements, for striking deals and for coordinating our activities. 
(Applause) So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. 
So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics. 
And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments. 
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known, killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more. 
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense? 
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

After that first injury, their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. 
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion, I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible. 
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. 
It was really something. 
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. 
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies. 
Well, the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated. 
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census. 
Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. 
Thank you. 
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means. 
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity. 
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is, will you feel stuff? 
This is a serval cat. 
E: Ooooowww. 
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. 
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus. 
And we do something different than what we did in the past; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that. 
And right now, that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us, that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. 
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project, and Ben became an instant media celebrity. 
Instead of -- cement usually emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement. 
If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. 
With deworming, you can get an extra year of education for three dollars. 
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet, we need to look somewhere else for the solution. 
I'm trying to remember the words -- "monism," "dualism," categories all over the place. 
The human brain is not a large rat brain. 
Of course, you understand, the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying, quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process. 
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other. 
And you can see, off a tiny film, incredible clarity. 
There's consequences for carbonate organisms. 
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers. 
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. 
I mean, that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris, you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to, what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case?" 
She went to school.

Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain, a wound. 
So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. 
So how do you do that? 
The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. 
Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America, and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe, they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job, its old ecological role, of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it. 
Can't copyright a costume either.

First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way, and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon. 
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one, is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online, so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.

And perhaps most obviously, and perhaps most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrate this -- it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity, of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine. 
And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable? 
So what are we waiting for? 
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me -- and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.

In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. 
Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity. 
But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic. 
No one can survive alone. 
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate. 
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently. 
Why? 
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important; we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first. 
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself. 
But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create very powerful energy, which has never happened in the Chinese history. 
It includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil. 
I want to ask you, why do you think this is? 
(Laughter) Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause) BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way, we get a little bit annoyed, right? 
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.

In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so-called social sector issues, I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for-profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues. 
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton. 
I've come around in the last 10 years. 
And it cost about 500 dollars to start it, which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today. 
They bring out the issues of stigma. 
In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times, some who mind the nation's purse want to cut life-saving programs like the Global Fund.

And inside, we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive, because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared. 
It's a matter of choice. 
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water.

This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. 
But she knows where he is. 
Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming. 
It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress, incrementally, bit by bit. 
(Laughter) So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. 
See that up-close picture? 
It's not one of the first things people would say, if you asked a modern cosmologist, "What are the problems we're trying to address?" 
This person was interested in the history of frustration. 
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. 
It has to be part of the explanation. 
I realized Sister Sam was right. 
And by answering that question, I think we can take something extremely powerful away. 
We have the kind of the flash of insight, we have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments, we have the lightbulb moments, right? 
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one. 
So the sounds that were before distorted and loud, were suddenly a melody. 
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes. 
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done -- it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. 
And electronic tattoos also shout. 
So what's going to solve this? 
Knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every 15 to 20 years. 
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. 
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. 
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. 
They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. 
So Kleiber is about process. 
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them. 
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it's not isolated points on a map anymore, it's a network we've created. 
I think it's a great challenge. 
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. 
Now as you ponder that question, maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten, the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher. 
So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in, and using the spare soil that's there on the site, we could make a power station that was silent as well. 
And guess what, it worked. 
These guys are facts. 
As I thought, that's most of you. 
(Applause) There have been many revolutions over the last century, but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution. 
How interesting. 
You learn swimming by swimming.

(Music) Do you hear it? 
We call this gravitational lensing. 
He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped. 
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business.

It's good to get gifts for people that you know. 
I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old. 
We were in Les Houches.

I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places -- more sustainable places, period. 
I suffered a lot as a mother. 
The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have, it's how you use the bombs you have, and more importantly, whether you ought to use bombs at all. 
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks as living things, as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand. 
And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators, so they combined with a lot of local designers, local writers, and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing. 
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.

With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass, we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding, which is just not feasible. 
So satisfaction was a very important part. 
You have every boat that goes out, every boat that comes in. 
And just a piece of context -- the societies in which our brains evolved had about 300 products and services.

What do we learn from that? 
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising, when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet. 
They don't talk about God and God's nature. 
And you're going to say, "Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States, but it can't work in Bulgaria. 
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word -- I hope to have an interest in the English language, but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter) I'm trying. That clock has got me. 
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search, so she asked everything she could think of. 
I want to salute the 100,000 ships that are at sea that are doing that work, coming in and out every day, bringing us what we need.

The reason for it, in part, was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable. 
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion? 
And so he agreed. 
So I decided to close it down for one year. 
I think we're last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handicapping ourselves. 
They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store. 
(Applause) It's a continuum of traits. 
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. 
Maybe there's not a single map.

We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt. 
All right, see? You guys should try it out. 
I would say it's a work of genius. 
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks, they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. 
People come around us and start asking, "What are you doing here?" 
But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting: Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. 
And a final really interesting study -- it's been shown, a correlation between play and brain size. 
And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system. 
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look, once you learn how to look for them. 
The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. 
Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. 
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place. 
In fact, if you compare India with the average developing country, even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth -- now India is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period, India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies.

It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip. 
So I didn't give up. I continued. 
And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell. 
Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example. 
(Laughter) But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture. 
But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West. 
Thank you very much. 
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.

And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own. 
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him? 
There are 10 million people in the U.S. 
So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go. 
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit, and we now, being the top organism on this planet, are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. 
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga. 
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved." 
When schools stop doing that all the time, I will admit that, yes, it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. 
We are sharing with them whatever we have. 
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know, almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government, one way or another. 
It was fantastic. 
So, here we have "figure" in black. 
So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon, maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for. 
He's closing in on the van to make the moving pass. 
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.

Why welding and why not computers? 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. 
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. 
And there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief. 
So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday," current rain, "It is raining now," or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."

When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong. 
It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally, across teachers, parents, people involved in education. 
And I had the pleasure to work on the central plaza. 
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils. 
It's no wonder that many political leaders, and I don't exclude myself, have lost the trust of our people. 
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims of our circumstances.

And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. 
This is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes, which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S. 
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right, putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters. 
I will do so with the help of words, of course, but also a geometrical shape, the circle, so throughout my talk, you will come across several circles. 
Every year, thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu. 
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value, that actually intangible value, in many ways is a very, very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things. 
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt. 
They're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders. 
But the point is, this is all good news, because when something is predictable, it is what I call designable. 
This happens every year. 
No, no. The other way. 
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking. 
In other words, choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it.

May none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species. 
So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time. 
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.

I joined Ford after college, after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. 
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. 
And I don't know what the solution is. 
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world." 
When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. 
So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city. 
And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats. 
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections. 
He had to come up with new ideas, new things that would be hard to copy. 
Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this? 
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia. 
Well, I've come up with seven things that, I think, show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. 
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000. 
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair. 
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers. 
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. 
Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. 
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife? 
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars.

But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not. 
And he was a perfect fit for the part, and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance. 
Child: Um, yeah. 
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question. 
Significant problems remained. 
When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both. 
I've been working with plastic bags, which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years. 
It's manipulation, but it can work. 
But partly, we want to make the world a better place, and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation, and we're in the process of setting that up. 
And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. 
Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments, are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. 
People who spent money on other people got happier. 
It is a system, like traffic, which has components. 
Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments, who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. 
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right. 
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color? 
The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace, and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here, we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. 
But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy. 
And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. 
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way. 
So they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. 
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction. 
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem. 
So they set out to make San Francisco a no-kill city: create an entire city where every dog and cat, unless it was ill or dangerous, would be adopted, not killed. 
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it. 
Last March, we received very sad news. 
One is: if 80 to 90 percent of what we're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic, then why don't we call it what it is. 
They were going very slowly. 
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion -- priming God, making people think about God -- often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior. 
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. 
This includes, for example, the 3D laser scanning systems, ever more powerful personal computers, 3D graphics, high-definition digital photography, not to mention the Internet. 
It's something terrible, horrible. 
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies. 
We could have been done by lunch here. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Sound familiar? 
But then after a while I realized, this is my life. 
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. 
But I want to give the last word back to the novelists, and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying, "The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. 
Whether storytellers realized it or not, they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville, radio news to radio theater, film to film in motion to film in sound, color, 3D, on VHS and on DVD. 
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. 
That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this. 
So if you met an educationalist and said, "I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing," you'd make a lot of friends in education. 
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. 
And in one case, it originated on another continent. 
Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. 
So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. 
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it, but you couldn't get the same object back. 
We have training going on in China, in the USA, and many other countries.

They meet Neanderthals, mix with them, continue to spread over the world, and somewhere in Southeast Asia, they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific. 
The collectors, the friends, the press, everyone said, "Nice, but thank you." 
For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. 
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. 
She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school. 
The acid rain was falling on the forests. 
But I think they're doing very important work. 
And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care. 
(Laughter) Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal, and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster, then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal? 
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were, then Mother Nature would have a problem: How on earth do you get chimps to mate? 
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally. 
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana. 
Here's just a symbolic picture of that. 
Wow, that's interesting. 
Because the thing about being autistic is, I had to learn social skills like being in a play. 
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different. 
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. 
So instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. 
I think he's going to be super popular. 
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing -- we've had 900 million media impressions for this film. 
That instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them, that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker -- somebody who's half asleep, following instructions, keeping their head down, fitting in -- every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me." 
This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth, driving photosynthesis, driving the ecosystem. 
But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing. 
And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways. 
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place. 
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews, the people around, who were interviewed as well, refer to that behavior as Talibanization.

One draws boundaries. 
It will take us about four months to make this return journey. 
So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine, the fuel cell, hydrogen as the energy carrier. 
Those three projects, they're based on very simple scientific phenomena, such as magnetism, the sound waves, or over here, the physical properties of a substance, and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way, and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us. 
My carotid artery had ruptured. 
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston. 
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is, if you don't want to hear it, you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it. 
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to.

Always, we believed that change will spring from within, that change should be a reconciliation with culture, cultural diversity, with our faith in our tradition and in our history, but at the same time, open to universal values, connected with the world, tolerant to the outside. 
The second one took place in upstate New York. 
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover. 
Thank you. 
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this: I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, "A Boy Named Sue." 
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal, he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.

By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion. 
Penicillin was discovered in 1928, but even by 1940, no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced. 
In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones. 
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day. 
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000, because they didn't believe us, and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. 
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside. 
And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology. 
Another kind of cell, head direction cells, which I didn't mention yet, they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing. 
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light. 
(Music) So in the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music.

And when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you. 
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism. 
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.) Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for? 
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left, the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes. 
This little guy is called the kinesin, and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell -- whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle, whether it's to build something or repair something. 
But a couple of weeks ago, I asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt" and to send me screen shots of what they got. 
This is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules. 
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. 
But it's okay, it's the Red Sox, right? 
You think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression, and that's like what you get. 
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch. 
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. 
Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. 
So without further ado, would you like to hear it? 
Now that journey, and what took me from Essex all the way across the world -- by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists. 
Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern. 
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. 
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. 
And imagine copying that by hand. 
So, this possibility of a new type of global recognition, I think, is driving huge amounts of effort. 
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others. 
They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith. 
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.

When you educate a girl, she tends to have significantly fewer kids. 
The CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week. 
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge. 
But is that really the case? 
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab. 
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring. 
I might like it more than you like it, because I know how bloody hard it is to do it. 
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. 
And I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. 
This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype, explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital. 
For example, when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada, the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. 
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again. 
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect, to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. 
We have time to think, we have time to I don't know what, speak about art and things like that. 
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life. 
They were run by an inexperienced staff, with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals -- in many places there were not even art directors. 
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, it's got some major, major flaws. 
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. 
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that. 
(Laughter) "It was the clearest I could find. 
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga" or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it, and that starts to develop flavor also. 
In fact, there's one lab in particular that represents 20 percent of all that capacity. 
And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality. 
Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story. 
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows? 
(Music) With the combination of simple, interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. 
This is the letter SHeen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh." 
This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict, particularly over oil. 
These are a species that we need to join with. 
Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home. 
The cells are kind of homesick; the dish doesn't feel like their home. 
You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. 
Happily, we're not machines, and we can do it. 
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED. 
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. 
What we're also missing is blue carbon, which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon -- more than 55 percent. 
And so our project is seeking to look at this readout, understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on. 
So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy. 
Who doesn't want healthier children? 
That guy could be a problem. 
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber. 
The obvious question would be to ask, what do you think are the biggest things? 
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain. 
And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. 
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea. 
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars. 
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say, well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption -- I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption, and feeds corruption. 
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. 
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex. 
They were happy. They had their plans. 
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw. 
Everyone can do it because three guys, Jon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google, saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer, and they said, "This is so fun. 
And these plants need sunlight, so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. 
A treaty that decides who gets to do this. 
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent. 
To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future. 
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases. 
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. 
That was the healthy choice -- right -- because the water wasn't safe to drink. 
More recently, Harvey Cushing, who really developed neurosurgery as we know it, who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook, he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing. 
As you look at these two columns here, doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count, a new way to imagine what's important to us in life? 
We've got lots of people, pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete. 
Pills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people. 
Let's call him Don. 
(Laughter) And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station, our condition was that we would work with them and that, whatever we did, we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. 
And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice-based food web. 
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere." 
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams, and we have passions, and we have visions, and somehow we get those things crushed. 
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. 
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here.

Because when people talk about intervention, they imagine that some scientific theory -- the Rand Corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population. 
So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too, because people, mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending. 
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing, possibly congenitally, in the upper registers. 
"What does it look like?" 
Thank you. 
So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here. 
So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed me up to the corner and she said, "When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there. 
Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire? 
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. 
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing. 
And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. 
That's the region where entropy is low. 
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. 
This is Bjorn Sundin. 
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment, who was our client, with the Chinese children, using the landscape. 
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are, and we have, not only our memories, but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy, it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy. 
[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments] Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending, before we had leveled off, our level-off point was 45,000 feet, so before we had leveled off, Pedro began leaving us, and the beauty about it is that I believe that there's something after life. 
Why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate? 
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color, it means 16 percent by weight. 
She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command. 
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450, so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot, and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to 350. 
When you run very short wavelengths, like a tuning fork the antenna resonates, and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing." 
Because I tried to make it intimate. 
And what they do, then, is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange, black and white. 
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain. 
No robots required. 
Man on a horse and a man on the ground -- that is viewed as two totally different things. 
Faced with absence. 
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs; they're people who love doing what they do. 
SW: Good job. Thank you all. 
The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures. 
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. 
But it's also used to assign a temperature range. 
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of. 
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light, a flash of blue light, and by looking for this blue light, you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. 
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works. 
(Honking) (Applause) Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you. 
It comes from everywhere. 
Then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the satiation. 
E: Hi, sweetheart. 
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection. 
And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. 
So from studying these genomes of extinct humans, we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa. 
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. 
(Laughter) I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams didn't call me from Stockholm. 
I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. 
They just had some general comment. 
And this is how we look for them. 
But in 2007, two remarkable individuals, Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States, made an astounding discovery. 
But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y, or research and develop it yourself. 
20 percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs, 20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart, is servicing this one organ. 
And after the battle, they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review" to teach you what you've done wrong. 
But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live. 
This is one that commiserates with you. 
So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys, and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?" 
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations, and that you get the right corporate behavior. 
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts) Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) What's the point? The point is what science does for us. 
How can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology? 
If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things, and we re-engage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart." 
This is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at. 
But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. 
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing, and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal, over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs. 
This is Prickly Pear Creek. 
So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill; they're a problem where there's not. 
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free. 
I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic? 
So when he gives me his final paper, in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure, I say, "I don't know.

It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape. 
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years, through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off, both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. 
This is a map of social networks worldwide, and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service. 
And I was privileged because I was born into a family, my father would always encourage the boys and the girls. 
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin, and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.

And there's no adaption. 
This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues," which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could. 
In the last 20 years, people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food. 
Now how do we communicate with rats? 
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. 
For a while I was an interface designer. 
The other question everybody asks is, why doesn't she just leave? 
We don't have a neutral word for it. 
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun, as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade, each of the tiles moves individually. 
This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods, and on the other hand, off. 
Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees. 
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" -- all these little details. 
At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change. 
It goes from slave trade to over-consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between. 
Now in some cases math can even help explain, or propose explanations for, historical forces. 
(Applause) In Oxford in the 1950s, there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual, named Alice Stewart. 
Take astronomy as an example, which Yochai has already mentioned. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you. 
And then in 2003 I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. 
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use, and, you know, you get something like synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology, it really compels you, you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups, because they have better infrastructure, they have better facilities, and they have access to pathogens. 
And it's the largest seed bank in the world. 
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us. 
And at TED here in February, their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. 
Two hundred years ago, the United States was less than a few percent urbanized. 
And we probably need, well, we probably need a cowboy (Laughter) Yeah, let's take that one. 
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods. 
(Applause) The most powerful thing of all, it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did. 
There are some people who are very good at this. 
So let's make room for the good stuff. 
Kittens play. We all know kittens play. 
So what I hope is that, not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva -- that's a very positive and meaningful thing -- but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said, between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world, this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not. 
You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids, and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms -- to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. 
Writing is something that came along much later, and as we saw in the last talk, there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened, but according to traditional estimates, if humanity had existed for 24 hours, then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m. 
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. 
I find weather extremely fascinating.

Whether or not you're in my business, you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV. 
So, if we can figure out how to do that, then we have the vaccine, and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem. 
This insight that entropy increases, by the way, is what's behind what we call the arrow of time, the difference between the past and the future. 
And if they did, he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser. 
Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur. 
And what else do you think about these people?

In agile, workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time. 
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. 
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy. 
For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. 
There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there. 
We've said, well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired. 
And by this, I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate, the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. 
Art, music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. 
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with.

Let's see. 
There are a lot of fun complexities that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't. 
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem -- so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. 
And, using those rules, he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. 
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide] This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. 
Carbon is banned. 
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly. 
When she was planting those trees, I don't think most people understand that, at the same time, she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. 
Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us -- the animals, the plants, the insects -- love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss.

Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection. 
Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly, without breaking election secrecy, which is so very important. 
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet. 
It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story. 
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside, in fact, a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. 
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly. 
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia. 
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking. 
(Laughter) So that's all that happens. 
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others.

Is CO2 produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up? 
But it's not documented. 
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second, had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.

So it's enough to bury any industry. 
(Laughter) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. 
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. 
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular, radio waves. 
Another example is "slash." 
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too. 
And you did. 
It's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful. 
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know, founding public-health interventions in the system of the city, one of which was called the "Nuisances Act," which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. 
And originally it was a math problem more or less. 
I remember one night, one of the nurses came in, Jonathan, with a whole lot of plastic straws. 
One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship. 
And so we try to ask: What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in, not fighting to stay out?

A frisson of excitement went around the room. 
It was a hell of a challenge, and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. 
It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. 
And scientists have done this on land for years; we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color. 
There has to be something better." 
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me with good spatial qualities, for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things. 
I went and created my own version of Indian history. 
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. 
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time?

It's about conversation and faith. 
Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter -- the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. 
as a treatment against consumption. 
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing, that's a really good signal that when the information gets out, there's a hope of it doing some good -- because the organizations that know it best, that know it from the inside out, are spending work to conceal it.

And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations: cases where nations work together, in effect, de facto, the way China and Britain worked together to build, first a little enclave of the market model, and then scale it throughout China. 
It's out of print -- still ... 
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.

I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls, and as I approached her, she looked at me, and I sat down. 
(Applause) Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. 
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans, was completely invented by users, and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier. 
And let me show you. 
We would actually enlist them -- which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals. 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. 
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. 
If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the U.S. would look like today. 
Here's why. 
The distribution shows. 
Well, this might not seem like much right now. 
What do you think these people are doing? 
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners. 
And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012, you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five have done so. 
In 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds. 
We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. 
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs five times, eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory. 
Which is right? 
We should look at how society and culture in this socio-cultural regulation are a work in progress. 
The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions. 
Then if you look around you in the bathroom, you see lots more products like shampoo, conditioner, anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion, but also toothpaste. 
But recently, we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight, to actually find ways to improve the world, to do something better, to actually fix things, not just understand things. 
A common thinking error of radiologists, for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. 
I soaked it up and I thought, how could I ever have taken this for granted? 
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y. 
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. 
But when I went up on top, it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. 
Thank you very much. 
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table. 
But then she falls back again. 
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. 
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two, and a man came up to me and said, "You can't take photographs here. 
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions: Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity. 
And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world. 
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron," and then she looked and did this. 
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case. 
Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there. 
The story begins in 1996 when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. 
And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too. 
RSW: The picture on the screen, is that Disney? 
I tell people, if it's in the news, don't worry about it. 
And all of a sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped, and you stared. It was creepy." (Laughter) This girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about. (Laughter) "And then you looked at the guy next to me, and you smiled, and you reached in your bucket, and you pulled out a lollipop, and you held it out to him, and you said, 'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you.'" And she said, "I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life. 
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures. 
I took one look at the road map of life, and I ran off down the street marked "Geek" as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me. 
(Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. 
This is that student, David Bradwell, who, in this image, appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work. 
This is research -- can't buy it. 
Or, really, any other kind of deer. 
Sexual reproduction enters the picture. 
The really crazy change is here: it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other, the fact that former consumers are now producers, the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another; because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals, and because the size of the network, the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants, meaning that the network, when it grows large, grows very, very large. 
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. 
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling to conventional, classically trained economists, is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points. 
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial. 
And the second thing, I think, is that the world needs to have people in charge of that. 
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau, three very famous mountains in Switzerland. 
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, "Slap Mother Nature in the face." 
This worked. 
That's kind of too much effort. 
And all sorts of people, moving up to the First World War and between the wars, tried to solve this problem, and nearly everybody came up short. 
You may think that I've cheated, that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there. 
Whatever I ended up being good at, I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given. 
It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location, and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern. 
For example, a billion-dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell 200,000 really advanced vehicles, like some you saw earlier. 
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. 
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need. 
The reality is that there's, what, 21 nations that have nuclear power? 
This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. 
And it's a crisis that has its structural facet -- it's partly to do with demographics. 
Life also has a kind of inheritable information. 
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool, and see if we could, in fact, find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. 
They were never given a chance to learn how to react." 
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that it's not really like that? 
He cared in a very different manner, but it takes a lot of time to understand that. 
(Laughter) Would there be time to be able to work with it? 
"There is only one question: How to love this world?" 
(Laughter) Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. 
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world. 
It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. 
Look, the homes are full of machines. 
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral. 
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment. 
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene, you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life. 
But it was earlier this year, when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. 
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall. 
And they come in and they go through the process, our process, they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently. 
Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life. 
And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses, "I'm not going to leave you." 
And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture, in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet. 
And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight. 
Well, in this technique, what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world, the artisan bread-baking community, has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads. 
In my experience, you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine. 
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists. 
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. 
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer's Hill where I used to go and spend hours going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?" 
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight. 
Now there are 880. They're increasing in population by three percent a year. 
Consider this -- my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it. 
But this time, the migration leaves African-Americans in place, as families and businesses flee the city, leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. 
Practice makes perfect. 
When I came home to Gando to bring the good news, my people were over the moon, but when they realized that I was planning to use clay, they were shocked. 
Then the issue is, what about the Chinese political system? 
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. 
This is what we teach in the night schools. 
It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms. 
Every poor country is corrupt. 
It never happened. 
Some of it is a matter of luck. 
That's what Europe and North America represented. 
This could be our finest hour. 
Do I have a chase boat? 
You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you, who have similar interests. 
And I had this huge closet full of clothes, and I could only wear a third of it at any one time, and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy. 
In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. 
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813. 
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. 
We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors. 
The second is for continued population, human population expansion. 
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. 
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. 
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye: bacteria and grains of sand. 
Our lives depend upon these creatures. 
So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is, a city of the future has to be socially integrated. 
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife. 
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases. 
She's beaten. 
(Laughter) There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. 
Older people who keep learning and are curious, they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. 
and the gymnosophist answered, "I'm experiencing nothingness." 
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent. 
Or you could go to places like this. 
And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do. 
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. 
But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. 
It was [unclear] high school. 
Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo. 
They're completely anonymous, as it were. 
It's a horrible situation. 
That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. 
Not today. 
And if you all believe this story that I've invented, then you will follow the same norms and laws and values, and you can cooperate. 
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. 
So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry, which GM has in Lansing. 
We all had a wonderful education. 
We call that poverty these days. 
The kids love it. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
We look at it every single day." 
(Laughter) (Applause) SM: So you know what's happened? 
This is the most successful order on the planet by far. 
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not. 
And just as we've been looking back this year -- in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years -- I would like to think that they will look back, that world will look back 35 years from 2050, 35 years to 2015, and that they will say, "Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015? 
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. 
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. 
People spent more time engaging in their meals, engaging with each other over their meals. 
Personally, I think it's something sexy. 
Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents. 
And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat. 
Can you break your culture of silence? 
If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators, then all creatures, including ourselves, that depend on these plants, would starve. 
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties. 
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. 
The first: Cut. 
And I just worked and worked through problems, until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. 
You can feel the familiarity of all beings. 
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet. 
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums. 
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. 
I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum, or like right here in New York with the High Line, a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this. 
The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security. 
We can see this unique fingerprint. 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. 
And if you see the word "entrepreneur," most people think men. 
And using this intense study of individuals, we find that it's not one particular generation that's doing better than the others, but the same individuals over time positive experience. 
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject that I'm talking about. 
Followed by that, you see on the West coast planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast. 
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s. 
That's all right. 
We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. 
We had no idea what key we were going to play in. 
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do. 
I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman. 
So, he didn't really want to say anything. 
And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking. 
Look at the pictures these data sets print. 
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple, or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like, what it smells like." 
In fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying, What would happen if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News? 
Without provocation, suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders, the next-door neighbor's oil fields. 
Five hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth, and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. 
The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. 
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. 
First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories. 
But hey, they grow back. 
It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye. 
And we see here the smile. 
And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you, and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK? 
In four years' time, it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars. 
Judge Forer quits, and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. 
You can't get rid of waste. 
So what are the applications? 
I want to fix our education system. 
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book, maybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community. 
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing. 
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly. 
And it's not just America. It's all over the world. 
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon. 
They happened in places like this, in the Judean Desert, 20 kilometers away from the nearest road. 
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data. 
This is after an hour under the ice. 
Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important. 
We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS, and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing. 
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. 
Whether you think about immediate gratification, and the chocolates versus bananas, it's just painful to save now. 
Are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it? 
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. 
In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. 
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day, and you just wanted to get home. 
Most of the time is kind of sitting there. 
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. 
"I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin, unable to speak, his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications. 
If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me, this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population. 
How do people release the documents? 
I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. 
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. 
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years. 
But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. 
And he became interested in that. 
What has your investigation focused on? 
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right? 
It's tedious. 
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum. 
But he felt all his old passion for her return. 
What we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening. 
The first is: can we really survive on volunteers? 
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. 
And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people, on your education. 
And they're in your house. They're in your house. 
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030, because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. 
Well, not exactly, of course not. 
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history. 
The great Descartes said something quite similar. 
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man. 
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters], there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide. 
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. 
We all need to love and be loved in life. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Chris Anderson: Chris, I've got a question for you. 
It evolved to soak up impurities." 
Thank you very much. 
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. 
It's a lady named Leslie Aiello. 
We called them the "dream team." 
EB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings, and use that to understand more about the brain. 
But we have a problem. 
If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry? 
(Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time. 
That started my love for technology. 
Airport security. 
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products. 
So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere, became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight. 
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste. 
The question is, is there a solution? 
So I just figured that out earlier. 
But what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them. 
But combined, they can create something like this. 
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will. 
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. 
I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. 
But we've got to get the architecture better. 
(Laughter) If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain. 
And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne, and how often I call in between. 
You can do so many more problems. 
That's where Maureen went to school. 
And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings, and let them flow through you, that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you, just by your eyes, by your smile, by your touch, just by your presence. 
This is something chimpanzees cannot do. 
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing. 
Now let's talk about sex. 
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season. 
So it's inherently safe to use. 
So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again, I went on with my theory study, and then eventually, and amazingly, I passed my pilot's medical, and that was my green light to fly. 
But the real success of course, is our band -- because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family. 
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. 
Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. 
So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving. 
If you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged. 
The infectious diseases Cochrane Group, which are based in Italy, has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not, and they've not been able to get that information. 
Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch, just consuming -- not producing, not sharing -- and we should say, "No." 
And it was that compassion which bothered them, because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain, a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. 
But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time. 
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. 
In surveys of European and American executives, fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise. 
And what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case -- I can't speak for anybody else -- but in my case, a lot of room for another big ego. 
What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles. 
They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. 
And you can see how focused the surgeons are, how much concentration it takes. 
This week? Last week? 
So we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thing is that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or not they have the potential for life. 
And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network. 
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months, it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough." 
And I came home and I said to my father and mother, "I just met this man: doesn't have much work, and he's sort of ugly, funny voice, and he's a teacher at school. 
This person has never been born. 
And the question is: How did we come from there to here? 
If you put one drop, one drop of something, in that water, it'll change it forever. 
But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence. 
What if I wore my scarf like this? 
So Gneezy and Rustichini said, "How many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers?" 
It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day. 
It was easily transmitted, but, luckily, was pretty mild. 
If you have access to this information, you can control your society. 
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. 
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father, and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine. 
And I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear. 
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods. 
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place. 
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition. 
He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. 
And I think it's an idea worth spreading. 
One day, my daughter Tybee, Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy, I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. 
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich. 
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years. 
Actually, that's not true. 
And go to the website. 
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. 
As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help? 
But they mean two different things. 
Everybody needs to be involved.

Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home. 
I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. 
(Laughter) So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. 
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this. 
Imagining a solo cello concert, one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites. 
But the future is actually even brighter. 
The overlong ears, the overlarge feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble. 
Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive. 
(Applause) Three and a half years ago, I made one of the best decisions of my life. 
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt? 
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith, and people of no faith. 
(Music) Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. 
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone, it's pretty much every direction. 
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. 
The observatory had just acquired a new book, written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded and translated and edited by a little-known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. 
At worst, they ruin lives: Weight obsession leads to eating disorders, especially in young kids. 
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are -- at least some of the big questions. 
And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about, the Mobius Project, where we're trying to bring together a number of activities, all within one building, so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. 
Why did she say that? 
Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that. 
A little bit of film was shot. 
They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver. 
Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent. 
Because after about six months of me talking about this, I think he finally figured out that I was really serious about the penis thing. 
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out." 
People talked about it twice less as it should have been. 
But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages. 
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe." 
What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work. 
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. 
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall. 
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads. 
What I see is the generation behind me. 
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. 
And I assembled this in my garage, and it now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada, Reno. 
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? 
And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. 
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data on the web, which he called dbpedia. 
As a result, the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English -- (Laughter) rapid improvement and all sorts of things. 
Can never tell if it's on. 
Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you, it's not good for you? 
It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time. 
And what we're finding is actually, even at the brain biochemical level, we are quite similar. 
Africa was truly fascinating for me. 
Because we live in such a noisy world. 
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. 
Here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929. 
Yeah. Okay. 
And at that moment, the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness. 
His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo. (Laughter) He's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life. 
Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago. 
But not only that. 
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots, I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing, especially retail, sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places. 
And I've broken it down into four-bar groups here, so you would know how you would trade. 
Now, you may push the car to the limits not because you're driving too fast, but because you've hit an icy patch of road, conditions have changed. 
It helps us become what we might have been. 
Let's just do this experiment very quickly. 
If you were to descend into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable, it would quickly become pitch black, interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms. 
India and China have the largest number of cycles. 
And apparently, that was because men played it differently, presumably better, presumably. 
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes. 
RSW: ... huh. (Laughter) I'd like to start this session again. 
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity. 
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 
(Laughter) But the more we've tried to disavow this finding, the more evidence we find to support it. 
Let's have a look at the third question. 
We all heard you pee." 
When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. 
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. 
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop, and I was the pigeon. 
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump, but it's not any jump -- that was September 11th, 2001. 
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display. 
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa, photographed by Chris Johns. 
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year, the number of days between each birthday. 
So what does this tell us? 
So if you're going to talk about jobs, then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. 
In fact, it carried risk of injury. 
And if it costs even a dime to police a user, that will crush a service with a hundred million users. 
And in the last years of the old regime, he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community. 
When I got back to his office, I wasn't really sure. 
"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number. 
(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that. 
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on? 
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening just in this 30-year period that includes the obesity epidemic. 
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing. 
And other examples of the same sorts of things with other people where you think where you think, "Is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons?" 
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. 
And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. 
(Laughter) I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes. 
I agree, it looks pretty amazing. 
As an advertising man, I have to admire that. 
You're not just going to have that, So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell, so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it, there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter) And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!" 
Thank you. 
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti. 
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words, so he just feels the horror over and over again. 
Anyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?" 
The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill, and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. 
They're also a country that is in dire danger. 
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile. 
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. 
But what else is life characterized by? 
You can see some internal organs. 
What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry? 
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child," asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. 
Thank you so much. 
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up. 
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size, even within Africa. 
And it also involved new choices for leaders. 
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. 
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data. 
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family, enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play. 
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious. 
I heard about disease, I heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related. 
I didn't want to clash with people. 
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are, then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream, and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history. 
And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do, she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies, yours is not a three." 
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded. 
Because think of the picture -- not the word, the picture. 
(Fuzz) Thanks. 
So they take the data, and they use it to measure progress. 
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. 
And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so, but they won't let me do that. 
I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. 
And the Internet has reached every corner of the world, the poorest, the remotest places. 
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart. 
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel, you'll see very black smoke. 
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. 
This is the thing that we are doing, giving them opportunities where they can rise. 
But we don't just have pies in the boxes. 
And of course, these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. 
Transparency is key. 
And people are, in fact, imprisoned within their own bodies, but they do have a mind. 
Keep it quiet please. Settle down. 
An emerging opportunity came -- didn't have time to get everybody together. 
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle. 
One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs. 
These Muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the 19th century looked at Europe, saw these things. 
Water wings -- an inch of water. 
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India. 
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake. 
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools. 
One is it's got to do economic reform, not fuss about the political constitution. 
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day. 
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders, they come to your mind immediately. 
(Applause) It's a very smart, smart audience. 
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us. 
But first, compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. 
(Laughter) So we're based in New York City. 
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm. 
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down. 
He doesn't stand quite as upright. 
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that. 
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem, where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that, when we want to create a global carbon market, but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem? 
At the age of 22, I was co-founding this organization in Denmark. 
First of all, most of them were born in the 80s and 90s, under the one-child policy. 
DR: I like that word. 
Please congratulate your children's team from my side." 
It's really cool. 
Another thing that has to be true about this pack: this pack cannot be really materialistic. 
And everything comes towards that, and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along. 
have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now, the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest, which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me, Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems? 
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, within seconds of attempting to upload the video, the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next. 
So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment. 
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. 
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children. 
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral. 
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. 
We don't just live, but we make. 
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. 
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. 
Thank you. 
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. 
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen. 
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. 
And politically, it was awful. 
AS: That was the theme: Who are you? 
It's a technical tour de force. 
We start from doodles and sketches. 
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here. 
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. 
And what does that mean? 
In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. 
As we cross this fence line, now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants: dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem. 
For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. 
But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple, in the sense that it is completely reliable. 
(Applause) (Laughter) I'll leave you guys with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes, present Middle Easterners in a positive light -- Muslims in a positive light -- and I hope that in the coming years, more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light. 
And it sounded like me, it really did. 
Ironic that my legs are fine, and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. 
Herd safety came with sharpened senses. 
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water. 
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a European nation-state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity. 
I didn't know that. 
A couple things happened. 
I'm going to put a plank on the ground. 
And I couldn't force myself across that. 
I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. 
He said that, "We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination." 
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. 
Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something. 
And that's ironic to me, because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world, yet it's one of the least discussed. 
The final challenge is for all of you. 
I'll quote General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction. 
I was on a high. 
And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050. 
And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. 
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat. 
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime. 
There's crackdowns on the press. 
What the hell? 
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0. 
And so naturally, I started to distance myself. 
That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard. 
And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president -- she was a woman, and even half a woman. 
What we don't look for is value for many, while we are generating value for money. 
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers." 
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti. 
And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially, and he would probably never have too much language. 
What is the importance now with the relations here. 
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. 
And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao. 
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. 
You can start doing things like, you know, transit systems that actually work to transport people, in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. 
You treat the obesity. 
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen? 
Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue, or other radiant heat source, goes as you move away from it. 
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long. 
This person is not doing anything violent, but they just won't do what we want them to. 
And the second is a design issue, and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement. 
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall, because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed, so musicians were moving out. 
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. 
I want to add a third element. I want to add model. 
I turned 31 last week, which is there. 
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. 
Made an intensified camera, wanted to make this electronic jellyfish. 
21 is the closest. 
(Applause) I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning, and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism. 
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10. 
You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. 
(Laughter) You fake it and make it. 
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. 
It burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them. 
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty. 
Thank you. (Applause) I have a doppelganger. 
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing, it's calcium carbonate. 
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. 
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said. 
So we have to manage many claims to the same video. 
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. 
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip. 
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya. 
And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute, of which it can be consciously aware of about 40. 
Well it was a Friday, this is true. 
Thank you. 
And this squadron of geese come over. 
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule. 
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us? 
The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. 
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis; it belongs to all of us. 
Zoom in on Haiti, in outline here. 
Governments in post-conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service. 
Even up to a year later, American parents were more likely to express negative emotions, as compared to their French counterparts. 
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993. 
We're right in the thick of it, this philosophical thicket. 
And that's a true "sí se puede" moment. 
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. 
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100. 
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well. 
(Laughter) SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel. 
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago, and only 90 miles from here, in San Marcos, California. 
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it. 
(Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. 
And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child -- he taught me how to sail, knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore, and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination. 
When talking about those reasons, let's break down certain preconceptions. 
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers, who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. 
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square, or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape. 
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village. 
Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish. 
So get out your pen and paper. 
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple. 
The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. 
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology. 
So two billion have access to washing machines. 
So what happens during the Second World War? 
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday? 
And my question to you is: if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese, where's the English language Yeeyan? 
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online. 
And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos. 
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that. 
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly. 
And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP, consider that we receive 10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms -- 10,000 times. 
We found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But that day, when I asked that question, I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right, when in fact it's a privilege. 
There's not a simple answer. 
In global terms, it's a little bit of money. 
That fills me with almost sexual excitement. 
(Laughter) Or Florida: "Police Taser six year-old boy at elementary school." 
So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it? 
She did it in secret. 
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" -- Harry -- "up from school." 
What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates, which we then follow up and find as planets, confirm as planets. 
Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career. 
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom. 
That's a painting of a circle. 
(Laughter) In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous. 
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. 
I had an awareness of being in my body, but also being out of my body, somewhere else, watching from above as if it was happening to someone else. 
(Applause) The saying is that with climate, those who know the most are the most worried. 
The Supreme Court decided. 
Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. 
No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me." 
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food. 
So here's what we think we want to do: Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously. 
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary. 
They're there in thousands in every office. 
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders." 
So when one-liners were really popular, everybody stole them from one another. 
And this is after two years. 
She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting. 
(Laughter) Two different mythologies. 
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx. 
How long are you staying?" 
RSW: Why did you want that? 
In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. 
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies." 
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned, orphaned, my father was making false papers. 
And there was an article written in the New York Times, September 2010, that stated: "Just Manic Enough." 
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. 
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. 
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur. 
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. 
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time. 
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. 
And so what you see there is the difference. 
The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind. 
What can damage accumulate in? 
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it; they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels. 
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. 
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation, and it actually gets worse. 
These countries have six children per woman. 
She says, "It was good." 
Can you do it? 
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc." 
This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. 
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. 
And the second kind of equality is one which we could call "democratic equality." 
And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience, from working with dying people and training caregivers, that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe. 
One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord, only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found. 
And when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like Barbara in the movie -- they get treated. 
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary. 
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do. 
Scaling: Conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many. 
But in ancient times before tooth brushing, up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime. 
And who could have predicted any of this? 
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today. 
Such an amazing story. 
That's how I hailed taxicabs. 
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them -- to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. 
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back. 
But he gave me a cup of tea. 
Hold it up. 
The fact is, we don't know. 
And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. 
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments, and I realized that I almost became a scientist. 
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. 
Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world. 
The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. 
And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time, when I'd finished it, of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you, is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. 
We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. 
In particular, the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different. 
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?" 
It is terrestrial skinning. 
Now it may not seem like it, but we are. 
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden, working alongside that bumblebee, was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common? 
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. 
So I came up with the following setup. 
I even took my friends back to my community, and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. 
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso, and she would teach people, everywhere she went, what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. 
So to illustrate that question, let me give you two countries. 
And the proof is not in a computer model. 
It will continue. 
So a little girl who you see just now, she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English, she said, "Well, apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease, we haven't understood anything else." 
And I feel like I've just got started. 
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. 
And then slowly, the trees start taking over, bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood. 
China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. 
And it's that basic, but they do this every year. 
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife. 
(Applause) I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days, talking to groups of students and professionals, and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. 
It's going to look a little bit like that. 
(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today? 
So they go around and do art installations like this. 
We'll make a new film about this process. 
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job." 
So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. 
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes, and they're all wondering at some point or another, "Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?" 
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying. 
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. 
Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far. 
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr. 
On one hand I have nothing against selling. 
For me, this became incredibly important. 
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans. 
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes. 
I'm not a geriatrician. 
Thank you. 
That's where the difference is. 
One woman loses her head. 
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another, but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes, you'll see a little bit of a relation. 
So since then I've been the bridge, and a lot of people have walked over me. 
So there's a pretty big gap there. 
(Applause) Each of you possesses the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised. 
You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday, the only environment he knew was gangsterism. 
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms. 
If you wonder, why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease, why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive, and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons, perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. 
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages. 
Don't you have color in France?" 
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever. 
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. 
In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed, most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street. 
In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual? 
We must have a full picture of what that means. 
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. 
That's what the show looks like. 
(Laughter) And then -- sort of -- (Laughter) So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you. 
So, can I build time machines? 
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is, but in fact, it's Central African Republic. 
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. 
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot. 
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. 
So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that. 
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house, so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?" 
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. 
It has the improving fundamentals. 
And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear. 
So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future. 
These senior water rights are key. 
So there was that feeling of lack of control. 
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission. 
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja. 
We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. 
Now, I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. 
Now, there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. 
It's really lovely. 
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference. 
Thank you. 
But you also learn other things. 
Another scientist with very big ideas, the superstar of biology, is Charles Darwin. 
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. 
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ... 
So you have these three mysteries. 
Thank you. 
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature. 
Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. 
In an irritated voice, they said, "You've given us a machine that works only in English, so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter) That's the first time, as a teacher, that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually. 
He's in there. You can see his legs up there. 
You can see the bars of the window there. 
These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. 
(Laughter) Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you, and if you can't find me, I will also look for you, and I hope to see you one day. 
And so, it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response. 
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this as, what I call, food for humanity. 
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. 
(Laughter) November 2005: the streets are burning. 
By being open source, we've created this distributed R&amp;D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. 
People have to eat. 
I met Belinda when she was 16. 
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it. 
And over the course of the next half-year, he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form, "water." 
Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. 
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator. 
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed." 
So, what we do: we've merged a lot of different data sets. 
Now a couple of companies -- like Google -- they have innovation time off, 20 percent time, where, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization. 
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing. 
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades. 
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway. 
(Laughter) He gets up there and then he ... comes back up. 
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library. 
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay? 
(Laughter) Zzzzzzip for safety. 
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings, so the collagen is as well. 
And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected. 
And in the future, as we go forward, we will, of course, experience terrible things. 
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. 
And as we've heard here, it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before. 
If he had accepted payment, he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no" depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. 
We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms. 
But now we do. 
When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night. 
He starts this new life. 
And in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses, there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites, those minute pirate bugs, those parasitic wasps, etc., etc. 
What kind of an experience do they have? 
CA: Thank you. 
Some came from the party who had just lost. 
I will not dance to that beating. 
Question one: so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does? 
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. 
So what do you do about that? 
Well we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago. 
I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box, but I might have hit a heartstring. 
He doesn't. 
Maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain, regardless of its size, especially in the cerebral cortex. 
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick. 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. 
Battered, bruised, you start again. 
Thank you very much. 
And I had my window into the deep sea. 
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted. 
The socially irreverent hippie show, "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In." 
[Clapping] And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us. 
I can look at your medical records; I can see if your pump is still pumping -- see if you're good to offer insurance to. 
And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. 
So thank you guys. 
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. 
Why? 
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to. 
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks, the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world. 
One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. 
It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. 
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food. 
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent. 
He did it by creating a movement. 
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex. 
There was a burning question though that would not leave me. 
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often. 
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house. 
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it, and commit a hundred percent, because very, very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. 
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. 
It's a big task. 
But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age, that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model, but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music. 
There's only one Africa. 
If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. 
In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy. 
(Laughter) One of the things I did just before 9/11 -- August of 2001 -- I took my son, Dax, who was 16 at the time, and I took him to Pakistan. 
He's born in Cameroon, which is smack in the middle of my tropics map, and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles. 
Unable to breathe on her own, she was put on a ventilator. 
The Earth can support that if we choose the right path. 
Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. 
Get those who killed this guy. 
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael, on the computer, and Thomas who's helping me onstage. 
And it was really a turning point in my life, where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. 
So, you cannot argue with that. 
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you. 
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently, and all new perceptions begin in the same way. 
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know, each buyer gets their name engraved on it. 
Tending those 31 dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. 
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. 
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground. 
(Applause) What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes, and this is from a book I'm preparing called "Letters to a Young Scientist." 
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly. 
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. 
And this is actually from his Degradation series. 
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom. 
But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places, very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low-cost, high-frequency public transport. 
And even as we do our own work, all too often, we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing, or the required thing, or the profitable thing. 
And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves. 
That top predator, of course, is us. 
So I did some research when I got back, and here's what I found. 
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums, having them participate in decision making, it's actually great. 
The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy, which as you can imagine, if you don't have an experience of it yourself, is quite a big thing to take on board. 
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. 
It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here. 
Thank God we are empathetic. 
They're still talking about it. 
I suspect there are some people out there sitting, kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, there's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way. 
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud. 
And after that, it just went wild. 
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole. 
It's time to let them grow up, so I want you to all support the zoning changes, the road diets, the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you. 
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. 
Is it still ethical? 
You've got to think green and green. 
On the face of it, it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness, what's an unfair advantage. 
You can see it in Pedro. 
One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know: when you fall asleep, it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. 
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance, and you've got to be able to raise awareness. 
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life. 
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me, more than a story about one teacher. 
Have you ever had any diseases? 
Consider, the single most successful international environmental effort of the 20th century, the Montreal Protocol, in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices. 
Mostly, a baseball cap, rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown, depending on whether I went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion. 
So we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. 
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big -- literally -- at early times. 
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. 
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there, they would be shocked. 
It's to supplement the experience. 
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work? 
And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her. 
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something. 
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. 
They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger, OK. 
The weather, as you can imagine, this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice. 
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. 
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. 
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script. 
Now, what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean, with CO2 levels lower than they are today. 
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction, and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America. 
How are they connected, and what does that global conversation look like? 
And because the government would be funding it, it would be co-branding these services. 
So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. 
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. 
And here I am with a pregnant woman, who is HIV positive and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident, because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. 
(Applause) What I want to talk about today is one idea. 
Just last week, in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010, it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked. 
Here in Sardinia, the older you get the more equity you have, the more wisdom you're celebrated for. 
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character. 
These radio waves penetrate through walls. 
So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff, do it hands-on? 
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states. 
It's a story about you and me, nature and science. 
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage. 
And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries. 
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. 
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen. 
Yet, nothing was happening. 
So now, Mahabuba, she is saving the lives of hundreds, thousands, of women. 
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda? 
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet, which I call aggregated giving. 
But you apply this. 
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. 
And then we made this. 
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land, the reflectivity. 
It's a remarkable statistic. 
Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment, cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying forest areas in West Africa; mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo; destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. 
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are. 
(Noise) All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. 
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big, but the Pacific is really, really big. 
And the first thing you need is ... a crowd, a group of people who share a common interest. 
In addition to making this personal -- so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women's relationship with their heart -- we're going to wax into the politics. 
They like the generics. 
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is the theme, getting more from less for more. 
It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is "[unclear]," respect. 
And so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft, if language really is the conduit of our cooperation, the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas, in our modern world, we confront a question. 
When we share ideas we all get more. 
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. 
So in order to undertake such a project, we obviously need brains. 
And I think that flies are a great model. 
National message. Targeted individuals. 
RG + AV: Thank you. 
And you can see them working in all parts of the city. 
(Laughter) Some of you are in the field, I can see. 
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message (Laughter) on the back of the shirt. 
Thank you. 
So I started to consider what I should do, and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better, and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public's image of the yo-yo. 
I thought it was an idea worth spreading, and I think it must be, can be, could be replicated elsewhere. 
I got my name just because I was so young. 
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. 
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. 
And you show up, and it's dead. 
Does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside Africa and inside Africa in that people outside Africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans, whereas Africans do not? 
And also, as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change, they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef, which will contaminate their fresh water supply. 
But of course, they don't listen. 
It'll dim. 
So the first person who gets happy, when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I, where you're always dissatisfied -- as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. 
She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather," and that probably his spine was to please his father. 
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out. 
Well, one issue is that radical innovation, when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people, have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. 
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence. 
Areas of heavy truck traffic, exposure to benzene and atomized metals, risk cancer and lupus. 
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico. 
The Occupy movement found a voice, and I still have to speak English constantly. 
It can be pronounced on a computer. It does something like this. 
We're molded by the same life force. 
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen. 
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen, did this wonderful experiment. 
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light. 
And it's used for conflict resolution. 
This is the only part that's battery backed up. 
And finally, India has had the deepening of its democracy. 
Thank you very much. 
And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green, because this is a weird color, a crazy color, and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later. 
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? 
I mean, these were the faces of my friends. 
So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien." 
Now there's two ways it could be doing that, and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site. 
So in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said, "Please, you have to make more." 
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name; it's just the two of us standing there. 
And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators." 
Is it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition? 
Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations, we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation, looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles. 
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem. 
It should be a challenge of creating wealth. 
They turned a trash place into a garden. 
So, this is the way it works. 
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold. 
In my opinion, these people are much more wiser than, not only the political elite, even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders including political parties. 
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left. 
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV. 
One young woman I met, teen mother of four, never thought about finishing high school, graduated successfully; never thought about going to college, enrolled in college. 
The quality of advice was identical. 
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. 
It's absolutely pitch black, because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean, which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet. 
So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. 
Whose son shall it be? 
The first is, the system has to be in non-equilibrium. That means the system cannot be dead, in a matter of fact. 
Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. 
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010. 
So this is great. It simplifies things. 
All companies die, all companies. 
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet. 
(Applause) And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. 
I was like, "Yes?" 
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. 
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot. 
Without flowering plants, there would be no clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks. 
Now, how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the fruit fly? 
I know. 
He had had the experience. 
It's being safe in the world. 
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight. 
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. 
I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology, and this inspired a shift in my mindset, from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. 
And they look at Europe, and they see an example, again, to follow. 
I think one of the successes is in its emulation. 
And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. 
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work, is to take these numbers, these statistics from the raw language of data, and to translate them into a more universal visual language, that can be felt. 
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. 
They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials, but predominantly plastics. 
Aristotle, in particular, he was not amused. 
(Laughter) You know, these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. 
Question number two: How do you sleep? 
So we've got, what, 17 more years to go or so before China's bigger. 
There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. 
This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old. 
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift. 
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving. 
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions. 
Here [among the poorest], population is growing. 
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. 
Thank you for your attention. 
So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars. 
And in addition, I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life. 
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project." 
Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping. 
They snap together like a kid's toy. 
This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients. 
It doesn't, I agree, look very much. 
So what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please. 
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about?" (Laughter) And I was like, "Cool. Bring it." 
NT: They wouldn't give me the money. 
In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day, "This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?" 
This is distribution as seen in Germany -- very different, it's shifted to the left. 
(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. 
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant. 
But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory, and be part of the community of nations? 
What is the effect? What's the consequence? 
For most people, if they think about hunger, they don't have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives, or their grandparents' lives -- to remember an experience of hunger. 
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger. 
What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle, you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment. 
Here are two of them. 
I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer. 
This is not just through malaria. 
I'm sick of it. 
The only difference is that now you're only working with 21 percent oxygen. 
We’ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning, our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. 
So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me. 
It was not until the 14th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple, upholstered in flesh and cloth. 
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. 
I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. 
(Laughter) And let's explore this notion of simplicity. 
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. 
This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods. 
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting. 
Solar transformations: the most exciting one. 
Now there are problems associated with aging -- diseases, poverty, loss of social status. 
We can do better than this. 
And for us to understand what happens with them, we're going to follow Brad. 
Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented, and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929, that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export. 
We were still back where Copernicus was. 
Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf? 
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. 
Also, they operate at high temperatures, and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down, but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances, or you lost off-site power in the case of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank. 
How did this happen? 
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right? 
Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. 
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara. 
That's why you can't hear more than two people. 
And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis. 
We feel good if we give. 
She's a very upbeat, naturally excited person. 
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. 
(Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them. They are not alone for this. 
So that when you walk in or you come in from home, if you carry a purse, it works in your purse. 
You always lose rare animals. 
I've mentioned just three here today: Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story. 
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap. 
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. 
When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up. 
And so that's what we did. 
CA: Wow, so your leak really substantially changed the world? 
And of course, being Australian, I started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing, again, from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia. 
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. 
What people don't think about is: what if the oil had made it safely to shore? 
Thank you very much. 
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act, I realize I've never been happier. 
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page, I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature, huge in heroism. 
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and '70s, and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. 
There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now. 
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive. 
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening. 
The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. 
There is not only in China, but also in the United States there are some very small, cute but bad cats. 
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. 
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her. 
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia. 
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. 
Here's an example. 
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide. 
A couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure, pulls them into the room and says, "Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something about that project you were working on. 
Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot. 
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things. 
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't. 
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise. 
It will create huge opportunities in technology. 
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome. 
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. 
The nursery, in here, is quite different. 
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. 
The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote, "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven." 
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said, "Well, why don't we have a place like that here?" 
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony, and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden. 
All right then. 
Traffic moved better. It was much safer. 
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack. 
So the whole world was drying out. 
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal, because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track. 
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. 
And that creates additional costs. 
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. 
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. 
As a third example, consider consumer products. 
And we'll just end with a few things. 
In the Rwanda Children's Museum, there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died. 
It’s the plant from which you can create mescaline, one of the psychedelic drugs. 
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of "I get it now" -- it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land, and yet the terrain was very familiar. 
It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall. 
Cluster bombs left behind. 
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars, two on the surface -- an amazing accomplishment. 
And now, if we want to select stuff, 3D, space, the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in, not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D. 
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. 
How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society? 
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S. 
You just -- you log on to your social networking site, your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend." 
Now plants are under threat. 
All of these are possibilities. 
This is extremely practical, but not so awesome. 
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff. 
Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. 
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today. 
What I think is important, though, is to move beyond these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit, these simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of as very, very simple with tiny little brains. 
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then, some of our great physicists, studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff. 
Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs, and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive. 
So I went out there, and I auditioned, mainly in rural township locations, right around the country. 
But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine. 
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000. 
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" 
Had the children eaten boiled sweets? 
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people. 
Now, something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design, too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed, and actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do these things. 
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. 
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right, I think it's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in. 
Now when you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. 
And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds, if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half. 
In the 1980s, as America went through a transition in the Reagan period, between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California, that was the end of America. 
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool, as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. 
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home. 
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers. 
(Laughter) Now again, we kind of caved in, and we did the very practical approach, which was a bit less awesome. 
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu. 
So she was making a politically rational decision. 
And that won't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say: "We want action now, we want to change course, we want a safe world, a safe world for future generations, a safe world for our children and our grandchildren, and we're all in this together." 
I think we have a problem in Mexico. 
I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974, during the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon," called "The Black Bird," starring George Segal, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie. 
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings, in spiritual traditions. 
It's riddled with gimmicks." 
(Laughter) And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice, it's really comparable. They have to forage for food. 
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. 
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume." 
And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities. 
The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block. 
But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. 
Government? Forget about it! 
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. 
One is the cellphone, which we use every day. 
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station, and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. 
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. 
Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again. 
And we have it in something called an aeroshell. 
But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities. 
We'll be waiting for you right here." 
In the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. 
I often don't think about it. 
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. 
In rodents, it was known to make mothers care for their offspring, and in some creatures, allowed for toleration of burrowmates. 
When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions. 
You can give the competing drug in too low a dose, so that people aren't properly treated. 
The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it, but that's a basic overview of how pollination works. 
Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie. 
Before long, there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany. 
Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in. 
And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place? 
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes, but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then, and this will move ahead, and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain. 
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. 
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple. 
And the big day comes. 
TL: We really -- Thank you. 
But recently, I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds, because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. 
You have to have low cost, but you also have to have a function. 
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less. 
And it's really an odd sort of structure. 
The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves. 
So when you look at something, like this image of this baby's face, it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina, on the front-end cells here, the photoreceptors. 
Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. 
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways, is actually India. 
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute. 
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded. 
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing. 
You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. 
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights. 
Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical. 
Video games are not the cause. 
Broken, fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in 2000, typical Irish weather on a Wednesday -- gray, snot, tears everywhere, ridiculously self-pitying. 
There's millions connected. 
And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. 
Like me, they are dreaming big. 
Our city is very spread out. 
So I told the singers, "That's our goal. 
It's made by specialized luthiers, also in Europe. 
"I don't want to go to school today. 
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. 
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much. 
Let's do some mathy thing, and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math. 
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures, creatures from a far-distant world. 
And I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought, maybe, yeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull. 
Cooking made it possible that mutations, natural selections, our environment, could develop us. 
But through it all, the family has grown stronger. 
And, in fact, he'd written the people in London: Could he see their x-ray photograph? 
She has massive five series of prime-time television, giving out very lavish and exotic health advice. 
All value is perceived value. 
There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there. 
Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. 
And I remembered his son was in our force. 
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn, because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in. 
So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola, like Willie H., who was featured in one of their ads last year, or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. 
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you. 
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. 
And I thought about a solution to this problem. 
They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something, clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass. 
Huge shortage of organs, God forbid, if you need one. 
It's in every language I've had experience with so far. 
(Laughter) More importantly, people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior, and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet, I know about it. 
You all know the story, right. 
When he finished the story, I said to him, "Dick, I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich." 
(Music) (Applause) J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it -- I actually visually kind of picture lines, and moving them. 
They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy. 
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there. 
Would he have had more possibilities in his life? 
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent. 
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding. 
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth. 
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning. 
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. 
It literally flat-lined. 
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person. 
So I'm not here today only to tell you how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems. 
And I learned football, volleyball, Frisbee, lots of games. 
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. 
Something like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter) Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that. 
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system, we can do it much better. 
We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by. 
This is every HIV researcher's dream -- in our case, a cure lead by lasers. 
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? 
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class, but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed, and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process. 
This is about my friend Brennan. 
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. 
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals. 
And when I have conversations with people, I remember having a conversation, for example, in Iraq, with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us, this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building, was a sign of the new democracy. 
They will start flying. 
It'll be a happy byproduct that we'll all benefit. 
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me, but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. 
One of them is from Mr. Einstein, and he says, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." 
To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen. 
Thomas Dolby: David Byrne. 
He wrote down a simple thing. 
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. 
I know that I am losing my grip. 
But, you know, in many parts of the world, governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. 
Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. 
What is the story you most want for them to tell? 
It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology. 
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass. 
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. 
They're not biologically compatible. 
It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood, this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool, that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act, bordered on an extremely popular water pump, local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho, that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. 
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID, got a bunch of other countries to help. 
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question. 
(Laughter) The second thing he said was that, "If children have interest, then education happens." 
Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story. 
And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. 
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. 
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier? 
You'd still have five billion left in change, and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. 
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication. 
These are the trees. 
KA: Well, I think that's interesting. 
They have epistemological modesty. 
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. 
It's actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter. 
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. 
Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this, where we have 27 million people in slavery in the year 2010? 
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. 
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. 
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems. 
Let's think about probability. 
In my life, when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition, they eluded me. 
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives, such a norm and such an expectation. 
One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer. 
So the mapping of participating in the story, it actually flows with the up and down. 
It turns out we're a pretty clever species. 
We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70, and we asked them how they felt emotionally. 
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. 
(Applause) But the second is even more important. 
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults. 
But yet she didn't stop. 
And from that comes the Internet. 
And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about, and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this. 
But if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the 300 -- the 300 friends -- you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population at a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint. 
It's about women themselves. 
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, "Girls," she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much. 
Let's think about the future: the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant. 
However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. 
Farmers that rely on nature for solutions, for answers, rather than imposing solutions on nature. 
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state, especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa, aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie. 
But this is the face of resilience. 
For example, most other Germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying, "Morgen regnet es," quite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow." 
So what I did is I opened up a hotline -- a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain, not necessarily related to that event. 
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. 
But maybe you don't feel that way either. 
It is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this. 
I was shocked. 
And that's exactly what we were aiming for. 
"Everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes I'm dead." 
We've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about, figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you, "But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended -- (Laughter) to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground. 
We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in. 
It did not evolve for natural survival. 
They will evaporate, and we will be left with nothing but empty space. 
Think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T. 
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. 
And I don't mean wizards and dragons, I mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children. 
And my personal favorite, "When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it." 
Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. 
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this. 
And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. 
Now there's no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. 
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches. 
This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected. 
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. 
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever. 
I'll do one in the fall. 
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds. 
Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month, of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history. 
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. 
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9/11. 
It allows us to be creative. 
Let's try that again. 
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other, the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe." 
And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. 
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right. 
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. 
It's a question of what the citizens do. 
That's not bad, that's a good improvement. 
He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia. 
And one other thing: it's fast. 
People have also wanted to deconstruct. 
What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles. 
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. 
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time? 
Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. 
He waits three days, and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile. 
I learned that at a young age. 
So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi. 
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. 
"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter) In other words, it starts off "once upon a time," the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter) So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — (Laughter) — "and it certainly deserves wide exposure." 
And also I still remember, we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate, but it came empty. (Laughter) So I remember it was so disappointing. 
These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. 
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both. 
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? 
I say, "Well I want molecules." 
And in fact, through those interactions, for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. 
Because when the door closes and there's nothing for you to do, you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. 
Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact. 
No labels. 
This is my favorite part of my speech. 
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity. 
But it's 60 years old. 
Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically, you're going to be sick or you're going to die. 
And I am convinced. 
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter) Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage. 
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. 
So I want to ask a question: What should culture in the 21st century look like? 
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant. 
It's now traveling. 
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note. 
And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. 
I do a radio show. 
We have to understand why people are not saving, and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions, and then see how powerful it might be. 
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious, controlled by the behavioral side. 
It's changed my life. 
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. 
As Eric Schmidt said, "It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them." 
My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. 
It's something much bigger. 
But it's not the only one. 
You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result. 
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?" 
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right? 
How would you do it? 
And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. 
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. 
And it's by design. 
There's not a formula. 
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full. 
Why is water important? Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. 
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now. 
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves, and how highly particular their solutions would be, if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into. 
Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments, long-distance travel, food processing. 
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures. 
For those without disabilities, at age three, they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven, to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender, they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings, often without even a chance to say goodbye. 
Now, he needed accessories. 
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. 
It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto." 
And secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available? 
Well, let me ask you this question. 
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. 
I didn't even go to middle school. 
That could power a Martian community. 
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. 
Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. 
We started with, you can take it off in the office. 
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. 
And the answer is skeletons. 
But over the last 30 years, China undoubtedly has done much better than India. 
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. 
There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s. 
And so that's led to a question for me: Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy? 
We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo, so we kind of put two and two together, and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo. 
He mounted a camera on the tail. 
We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus. 
There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. 
What is life? What is this stuff of life? 
You can build nice stations. 
It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other. 
More about that a bit later on. 
So agile is great for stimulating progress, but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core. 
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure -- error rather than terror. 
Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas." 
And think of the outside world. 
(Applause) I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects. 
The twins started producing milk. 
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. 
The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport, and I could see again, vividly, the camera flashbulbs going off, the paparazzi, the autograph hunters, the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. 
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today, this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different. 
It keeps getting reinfected. 
(Laughter) This is how he wrote most of his mathematics. 
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent. 
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. 
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks, six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis. 
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love." 
Grandmother: Well done! Very good. 
To put that in perspective, that's the same as a 737 falling out of the sky every working day. 
But be careful. 
I turned to him at the end of the meal, and it's a question I asked several times, and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly, but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain, some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you. 
It is travel in time, travel on time. 
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, that we'll be turning on later this year. 
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera, which turn out to be beetles. 
Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips. 
It's important to be accurate. 
This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable. 
And yet, for such an enormous industry -- there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea — it's become pretty much invisible. 
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice. 
It was ubiquitous. 
And so that became the governmental goal -- is, how do you stand out in this chaos, which is an expo of stimulus? 
For those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it. 
Now I can't speak for you, but it seems to be the case that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language. 
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. 
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls. 
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because I was sitting above in the power position. 
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system, a quick molding and modular components, enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments. 
We understood mountains under compression, but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension. 
And another parent said, "I feel as if I've played a role in an execution." 
So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies. 
We could go the other direction and say, well, what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields. 
The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent. 
Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection -- which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate -- might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry. 
Now of course, this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. 
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. 
And we have people all over the world doing that now. 
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch going, "I know what I'm going to do. 
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see: do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more? 
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though, we need to dissect network structure a little bit first -- and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person. 
If we learn to speak to one another, albeit through translation, then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness, complexity and compelling beauty. 
How would we write the treaty to do that? 
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. 
How about these hormones or resveratrol? 
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength. 
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow, then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light. 
I needed an anchor, an image, a peg to peg this process on, so that I could go from there. 
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or, really, some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors. 
It's about the size of Lake Ontario. 
BeatJazz is: 1. Live looping, 2. Jazz improvisation And 3. "Gestural" sound design. 
And this meant I could ski over very thin ice, and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world. 
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995. 
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment. 
It had a speech synthesizer. 
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. 
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me. 
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. 
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it. 
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing. 
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. 
It's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia. 
So here's the iPad. 
Even now, our choices are having unintended effects. 
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1. 
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are, wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this? 
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. 
"Now I have to write what she tells me to write." 
And then, as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement, they returned to them, and they've decided to cut back on their spending, to live modestly, and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty. 
And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York. 
I put it to you that information, if viewed from the point of food, is never a production issue; you never speak of food overload. 
(Laughter) But, you know, even beyond that, if you think about the logic underlying it, is something I call iPod liberalism, where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese who happens to have and love his iPod will also love liberal democracy. 
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends. 
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. 
First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer "Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form, and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy, is a remarkably simple question to ask. 
But compassion has another component, and that component is really essential. 
So it's a first very simple, a very obvious question I would like to give you: What are your intentions if you are designing something? 
But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control. 
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman, who was in the singles scene. And this woman says, "My brother is having trouble getting dates, so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating? 
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime. 
And if we can find that, then we'll be able to find, within each one of us, what it is that we need to find to face the big question, which is: how do we change? 
Let's take a look. 
Some of you might have seen it. 
In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. 
My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. 
Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail. 
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy. 
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. 
And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany. 
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma. 
You can't delete this data from your brain, but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant, impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives. 
There will be two big summits this year: the first one, in September in New York, is the summit for the sustainable development goals. 
I have to say, these are very hybrid places. 
(Laughter) If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you. 
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. 
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. 
And unfortunately, there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas. 
Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table, and since you're in my kitchen, please meet my wife. 
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan. 
And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children. 
If you have errors, you can replace a part. 
And along the way I've started noticing -- I'm on my third generation of kids -- that they're getting bigger. 
Here's the key question. 
(Applause) Newspapers are dying for a few reasons. 
Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world, we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. 
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. 
Now that is foreplay. 
These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons. 
You probably start the day with a shower. 
We're trying to heat up the space that we're in, and all that is trying to get out through the window. 
It's kind of arrogant. 
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown and war, and as I am talking to you, millions of men, women and children are suffering and dying. 
They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty, they want education to be for real. 
For animals that don't surface, we have something called pop-up tags, which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. 
I was awakened once during the night. 
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks, and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks, not just in the individuals within them. 
Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research. 
Well this is what it's all about, this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. 
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," — (Laughter) — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically." 
And you only have to notice, where we have light, there is a potential way to transmit data. 
It's something that was unimaginable to people then. 
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs and selling them at very low prices. 
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination. 
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away. 
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab. 
But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri, they get that sense of community back. 
South Africa is playing a role. 
Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father, and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation: I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength, and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person. 
They insist that he never doubted for even a single moment, let alone despaired. 
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today. 
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that. 
And just to give you one instance of this: food. 
After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. 
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. 
Because of private property of land and high land prices, all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. 
I really struggled psychologically, totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge, realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour, 3,000 miles was going to take me a very, very long time. 
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that. 
And if the story is a good one, it might even make us smile. 
What exactly to the people watching this do every day? 
But this is transforming 99 percent of the kids who get this. 
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles. 
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. 
So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer, Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park, hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade; people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up. 
So when I began to dive, in 2005, I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does, but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure, completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. 
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. 
Thank you. 
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975. 
Why is this happening? Why this confidence? 
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's. 
It is in telling the story of the mathematics. 
And my parents were part of a landed property family. 
That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley. 
And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to 4.6 billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. 
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze, her eyes really welled with tears, and she looked right at me and she said, "I will not stand for your desperation." 
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go. 
And three in here. 
It is developed in the cultures. 
We called the project Face 2 Face. 
(Laughter) To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material. 
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda, to maximize efficient mobility, providing more room for buses, more room for bikes, more room for people to enjoy the city, and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. 
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain, and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars. 
(Laughter) But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people, for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg, at the University of Stanford, makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies." 
Everything was going wrong. 
A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. 
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. 
These people have designs for your resource, and this is what you see? 
And I always wondered what happened under that web. 
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. 
It's literally the definition of noise. 
But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well? 
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing. 
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing. 
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. 
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently. 
In our process, we basically use it as a glue. 
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles, some black circles, there's another way of seeing it. 
But what about you? What's it going to do to you? 
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand. 
After 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body, and the internal bleeding stopped. 
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world? 
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle. 
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain. 
And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness, can hide secrets for a very long time. 
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. 
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change. 
Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration, a migration to the suburbs. 
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. 
The president wanted to change this rule. 
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died age 96, a few years ago. 
It wants to consume. 
We only meet them once. 
As you move side to side, it moves off. 
But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care, particularly to people that live in city centers. 
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind. 
But it actually doesn't leak. 
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. 
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark, has to do with weapons and energy. 
With a range of new technologies, we could. 
So by the time I grew up, again, I had a well-established passion for food. 
But if you do this, it's quick. 
There was a reason for everything. 
Here's a synthetic diagram. 
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win. 
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists -- and I know where of I speak -- this is really hard, because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right. 
And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio. 
That's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published. 
But we don't think about it that way. 
(Video) Guy: Joey! 
And over there I experienced other people's suffering, up close and personal, immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories, and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. 
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. 
And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing, and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?" 
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. 
There is only one, and that's the United States -- fortunately, fortunately. 
(Laughter) So we decided that we needed a set of rules, and we came up with a number. 
Africa has 53 nations. 
Why don't they just keep on going? 
Let me conclude with this picture. 
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm. 
(Applause) Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. 
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room. 
They were actually abusing them, despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were -- they were not even protesting. 
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs, because these are homes that are a part of the environment. 
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer. 
It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks. 
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home. 
Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade, and I want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments, all three of which focused on depression, the most common of all mental illnesses. 
Breast cancer, mortality is down to four percent. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So here we are again. 
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. 
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus. 
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome for mutations. 
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year. 
In this kind of reactor, you can't do that. 
Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss-crossing cities in all directions. 
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. 
But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about. 
And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma, which made it very difficult for an individual company, an individual exporting country to say, "We are not going to continue this deadly, disastrous habit of large companies to bribe." 
And in this case, we found gold mining activity, all of it illegal, set back away from the river's edge, as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. 
Indeed there is. 
And I was devastated. 
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. 
Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers. 
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women. 
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. 
It's such an honor for me. 
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't. 
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. 
This one I particularly like. 
What is this?" 
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them. 
No, you must really understand that. 
Very expensive, they throw them out for money, then cutting trees again. 
And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. 
(Laughter) And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob. 
But what are human rights? 
We fold it, and we transport it in a spacecraft. 
(Laughter) CA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic. 
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice. 
Having an economy, though, that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs, and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. 
You need to have the best possible equipment. 
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. 
So that's the visceral level. 
The empires weren't all bad. 
Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure, but Rajiv is sent home. 
TBL: Alright, "raw data now"! 
And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom, because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact, whether they be despots or dogmas, could be the protagonists. 
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. 
So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses? 
Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts? 
This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio. 
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. 
He figured out the system. 
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. 
You can go and buy some of the great tunes. 
We have reached peak child. 
Europe was not spared either. 
(Laughter) But Scott's journey remains unfinished. 
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree. 
He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him. 
We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. 
But it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games. 
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like. 
Well, there are other ways of making a flap. 
This is just not some blue sky thinking. 
I sold sunglasses, when I was in school, to all the kids in high school. 
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. 
And I was thinking about this, of all places, on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago, because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary. 
(Laughter) And we request them. 
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact, created a solution to terror. 
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger, the systems don't converge; they diverge more. 
Here's the cartoon on the left there. 
But in her office, there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table -- peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety. 
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything. 
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. 
You can see this in the data. 
And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies. 
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. 
And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. 
Video: (Music) DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live. 
I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way." 
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there. 
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. 
We certainly can't trust the bankers, and we certainly can't trust the brokers. 
And that was the mission that we came up with. 
(Applause) Power. 
Which leads us to a question: What was he thinking when he was being measured? 
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. 
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. 
But it all starts with seeds in classrooms, in my place, which looks like this. 
(Laughter) So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl, so I'm still looking happy. 
It is estimated that one in six children, that's one in six children, suffer from some developmental disorder. 
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. 
The last thing that I would just like to say, when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like, they almost inevitably say the same thing. 
Absolutely to the last inch, they can make that cooker. 
Thank you very much. 
The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe, but there's no scientific revolution there. 
Extraordinary precision. 
My dream would never come true. 
What's the next one on your list? 
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe, having a work tribe, having a community tribe. 
Poor people, people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity, the lack of dignity. 
a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo. 
Let me show it to you. 
(Applause) Hi, my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans. 
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture. 
One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. 
I will be the best attraction. 
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. 
Gas, you can't see that. 
Thank you. 
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community. 
GDP has been our hammer. 
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption, to noticing, to empathy and to compassion. 
But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily. 
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body. 
And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different. 
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. 
And all the tiles match up again. 
So, one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy. 
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things. 
Why do I call it a book? 
And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works, it's quite difficult to shift those. 
What other properties of language does the script show? 
The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. 
I have been changed with my children. 
Personally, I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible. 
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead, every single one of the men will be dead. 
And we need to be working with these students. 
If we can succeed here, it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon. 
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life. 
This works until you invent newspapers. 
I'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way. 
Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish. 
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things, but among them an "unparalleled serpent." 
But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. 
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. 
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I. 
Or are there more systematic factors at work? 
And this is what it looks like with visible light. 
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?" 
You can get knocked down, and it hurts and it leaves scars. 
Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa, and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci," which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. 
I feel her. 
They are supposed to be locked up. 
Why are people afraid of the ocean? 
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land, physically pushing people away from their homes. 
(Laughter) The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point, the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean, took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down, you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension, as I sat in a helicopter thundering north, and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom. 
(Laughter) So, this is actually a healthier cigarette. 
Why would someone bother? 
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel, who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. 
He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. 
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult, so the combination between the two ... 
He told me, "We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. 
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. 
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong. 
Liberation, and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. 
And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. 
I know a guy who did exactly that. 
Thank you. 
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. 
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right. 
This is a drug called reboxetine. 
(Applause) There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website. 
And that changed, first with ships when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution. 
But the idea is, we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them. 
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time. 
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to. 
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. 
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary, because I want to talk to you later. 
(Laughter) Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly." 
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent, only 1.2 percent. 
Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. 
Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball, they wipe their face. 
But you can publish your stuff online. 
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost. 
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next. 
How much does it cost? 
And so it became a tutoring center -- publishing center, is what we called it -- and a writing center. 
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9/11 attack. 
And then these earlier forms of humans disappear, but they live on a little bit today in some of us -- in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals, and people in Melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the Denisovans. 
Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. 
I told the staff, let's just take a bunch of wild plants, think of them as food ingredients. As long as they're non-poisonous to the human body, go out around Chicago sidewalks, take it, blend it, cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto. 
Would you be able to do that? 
But I've become increasingly interested in religion. 
There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there. 
So, we said, what else could we do? 
This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The 99. 
What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man's safety net, the best investment, is school feeding. 
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism. 
So there's something super interesting about natural systems. 
And cholera was really the great killer of this period. 
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. 
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill. 
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground? 
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs. 
We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. 
So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know, like part of me likes me, part of me hates me. 
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. 
I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist. 
In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. 
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic. 
They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them. 
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. 
Thank you. 
He had an enormous amount of love, he loved everybody. 
And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head. 
Thank you very much. 
This thesis is set out in a book called "Winning the Oil Endgame" that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com -- about 170,000 downloads so far. 
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds: can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards? 
This is something that we're using today to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten very much better too. 
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G -- and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale: H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go. 
And I truly believe that this can happen. 
(Laughter) It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn. 
They will completely lose. 
They made another machine to produce those people: the school. 
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. 
So people were asking a question. They were saying, "Is China drinking our milkshake?" 
And if they really were intelligent, why would they crack open nuts with a rock? 
Now remember here what Jefferson said. 
So just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right? 
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms? 
So a high I.Q. 
And it hit me: One of the most important things we all make are memories. 
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies, good though they are and professional though they are, do not calculate or disclose their externalities. 
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different. 
(Music) Okay. 
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos -- are the emcees of the animal kingdom. 
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time. 
He sat next to me on the New York City subway, and he started chatting me up. 
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2. 
You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. 
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old. 
And then there's another kind of thing that you might study, and you study that hard. 
An African shaman said, "Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes." 
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. 
There aren't enough examples of failures. 
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad, those square things? 
And depending on who you ask, the surge was supposed to push it up even further. 
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter. 
They need your compassion. 
So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin. 
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. 
That is until last year, when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur, the coveted French gastronomic prize. 
Isn't that awesome? 
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice. 
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. 
And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary, they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated. 
And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support. 
We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us. 
So it's going to be a while. 
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients, and they protect you against certain diseases. 
I've got a little video to show you, but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control, and this is also with only four LEDs. 
(Applause) A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here, what's going on with no difficulty at all. 
Some games are more about warfare. 
And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery. 
So here's another Einstein quote: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted." 
All the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway. 
This strategy, working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate, has never been done before in vaccine research. 
And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective. 
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories, which are innovation, competitions and social investing. 
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't. 
Rhythm is half silence. 
(Laughter) JM: Now of course, we were thinking, well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. 
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. 
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo. 
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing. 
Bharat also conquered the world. 
Great, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax. 
I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. 
Imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from. 
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war? 
This is Nepal and Tibet. 
We talk about this a lot, and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example: Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president, was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?" 
First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house. 
Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. 
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you. 
But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer. 
And then some very funny things happened. 
The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. 
So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. 
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. 
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations, which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism, and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism. 
So the impact is very strong. 
(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom. 
(Laughter) Like the things that people use. 
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story, I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome, and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. 
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. 
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much. 
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor. 
So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening? 
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks." 
It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. 
I've always been very worried about resource. 
So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists, they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists, basically meeting to see if they had work to do together. 
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment. 
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects. 
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things. 
(Applause) So little Billy goes to school, and he sits down and the teacher says, "What does your father do?" 
Now in the old days, conducting, music making, was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion. 
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. 
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. 
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. 
Cars have been here for really less than 100 years. 
The next concern was whether I would walk again, because I was paralyzed from the waist down. 
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. 
The people would become the defenders of that forest. 
They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950, all the things they were planning to do in 1950, all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950. 
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. 
Thank you. 
Nothing works like unconditional love. 
But the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident. 
And when she came down those steps, and it was just her and me for that moment, I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother, "I wish Dad could have been here." 
But what if you want to make an app? 
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on. 
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have. 
He discovered this, a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis. 
RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. 
We have about 500 people around the world working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing -- just for transportation, room and board. 
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street. 
BR: That's not it, though. 
Obviously the whole project here is huge. 
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. 
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. 
I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, and on my last day there, a girl came up to me and she said, "I remember the first time that I met you." 
And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly. 
I wonder why. 
That's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton, and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure. 
It's a double helix. 
I'm always the one taking the picture. 
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric Internet in the future, we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement. 
Four, modern medicine. 
During that same period, between 1950 and 2000, 2010, the city loses 60 percent of its population, and today it hovers at above 700,000. 
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way, then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix, in a particular moral matrix. 
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976. 
You know, take a look at his face. 
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know? 
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, but in the U.K., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening. 
You can't go and order it yet, but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men. 
The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing. 
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people. 
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. 
So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. 
And I go to those shops, if there are any, or out to the fields to see what they can get, and they cannot obtain the nutrition. 
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus. 
My son, I don't know where he is. 
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence, yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder. 
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things. 
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction. 
In that interpretation, by bureaucracy and administration, and they do it beautifully, may I say. 
And they're just so uncomfortable. 
Now I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. 
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies, this makes perfect sense. 
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it. 
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read. 
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now. 
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?" 
We know that about 106 billion people have ever lived. 
(Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it. 
(Laughter) Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her. 
We put the folded airplane on the balloon -- it took about three hours to get up there -- and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet, and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. 
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes. 
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice." 
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan, then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere. 
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different. 
It causes one to be created out here. 
But as I sat there for four hours, the full afternoon, reading Maslow, I recognized something that is true of most leaders. 
Now I was stupid, but not so stupid that I turned it down. 
It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking. 
We made an application for Layar, augmented reality, to find these AEDs. 
Now, there's a huge array of nations around that global average. 
(Applause) I want to challenge you today. 
And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives. 
That, it seems to me, is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument. 
And government regulation often isn't helping all that much. 
So as we think about power in this century, we want to get away from this view that it's all I win, you lose. 
For the next three dozen years as king, this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including, just recently, taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed, no coup. 
Similarly, if we'd had this talk 30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons, and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply, prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers. 
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved. 
And we can network between domes and classrooms. 
His restaurant is open seven months every year. 
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. 
(Laughter) You got it. Not all audiences get that. 
And women do fundraising. 
Probably not, but people like me do. 
And that flow, that flow of life, from the very base up to the very top, is the flow that ecologists see. 
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. 
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. 
We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world. 
But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off, and this area that's thought to be autobiographical, or self-expressive, turning on. 
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks. 
So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this. 
You've all learned that in school -- how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. 
And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project. 
I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines. 
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. 
Here's a great little example. 
It's plastic pollution. 
Yes. A cure for HIV. 
And then we have inequality. 
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson, finding the Higgs boson. 
Then he went home. 
By applying a strict process, we give them less control, less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions. 
So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. 
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn, they became, I would say, the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world. 
Especially I will not die for you. 
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. 
The year is 2010. 
This is someone selling this on eBay; it was clearly a woman’s hand, hopefully a woman's hand. 
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. 
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world. 
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots. 
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. 
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine. 
What I mean by that is, if the world superpower today was a communist, it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism, than it is today with the world superpower being America, occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. 
And then, there are those of us who don't have the privilege of sitting in traffic. 
The universe is not only expanding. 
But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed, and the skeleton itself has limited health information. 
This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes. 
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience, we still have this. 
And the answer is zero. 
Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help, is the northern white rhinoceros. 
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows. 
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it. 
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice? 
You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach, and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect, then naturally from that, the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical. 
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go. 
That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. 
And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra. 
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century. 
I will not forget where I come from. 
We find this in every country we look at. 
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt? 
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out. 
So, thank you very much. 
Astrology, for instance: like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces. 
Now, what is the point of this? 
Somebody who had applied for the passport. 
If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving, and whether you started out fat or thin, your brain's response is exactly the same. 
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from, it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula. 
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. 
We don't want to do that to our students. 
I think we all might have some questions. 
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon? 
But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees, it passes what we call the "thermal death point." 
Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago. 
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. 
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. 
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 -- and collected a little nugget and sent it to me. 
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss. 
There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion. 
We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. 
We seem to have forgotten -- as though, with the explosion of knowledge, the whole human genome mapped out at our feet, we are lulled into inattention, forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician, necessary for the patient -- forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient. 
I'm just here to give the geese what they want. 
This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. 
These are very, very cute little things right. 
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way, chaired one of the sessions, the first one, to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs, who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations. 
KA: But it had some really terrible ideas. 
And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue? 
My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves. 
That is my idea. 
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales. 
Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. 
Right? You have to have economic structure. 
(Laughter) You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light when you turn the light on. They don't. 
(Laughter) Don't get me started. 
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where. 
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars, but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention." 
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish. 
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist, he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war. 
And about that time, I got on the scales. 
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead, and this is my last post to my blog. 
But it is going to happen in this century. 
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune, which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. 
It's a bad idea. Don't do it." 
Would that give me a little more freedom? 
This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. 
There's also practical use for this particular procedure. 
(Laughter) And so many of the comments were exactly of this type, where people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial. 
So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution, Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. 
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk -- and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there. 
But all that belief had fueled me so long. 
I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less: college -- in your dorm, traveling -- in a hotel room, camping -- rig up basically nothing, maybe a boat. 
Do you go into your board and say, "Look, I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market, with consumers we've never dealt with before, and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?" 
And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now? 
Here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite, but an eight-legged parasite, of course. 
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that. 
It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these. 
You shouldn't worry about it. 
They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question. 
And they said, calcium carbonate. 
But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. 
We recognize this is a finite resource, and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. 
Well, I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University, and for those 25 years, tape recorders were everything to me. 
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. 
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work." 
So now I need to name this object. 
(Laughter) Then I said, all this is good, but I want to paint like a real painter. 
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. 
So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy. 
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you, and I give you one average point for each survey. 
If that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery, a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator. 
At the same time the city had this need. 
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells. 
We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two. 
The way I like to put this is: one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared, so one idea can serve one world, one market. 
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. 
And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo. 
And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this into this. 
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard, but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. 
"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle." 
(Laughter) [Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz] Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother, and we can leave it there. 
And server farms, or data centers are great libraries of knowledge. 
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000. 
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well, a very interesting observation, that actually those strange little signs that actually flash "35" at you, occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown, according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit -- those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras, which come with the actual threat of real punishment. 
I write a lot about "security theater," which are products that make people feel secure, but don't actually do anything. 
I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. 
You don't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather. 
They pumped the whole theater full of the gas. 
This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km. 
And what is it that we do that no other animal does, and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large, largest number of neurons in the cortex? 
It organizes itself. 
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience? 
So try to meet that bar. 
[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.] [They run small businesses that support our economy,] [design tools to help you ...] [... stay connected with friends, family and colleagues around the world.] [And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.] [Do you know an entrepreneur?] [Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...] [Even ... you!] [So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted] [Help heal the economy] [Make a difference.] [Take your business to new heights.] [But most importantly,] [remember when you were a kid ...] [when everything was within you reach,] [and then say to yourself quietly, but with determination:] 
And if you can do that, incredible things happen. 
All right. 
Dana: That way. 
So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle. 
This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems, whether it's climate change, whether it's migration, whether it's the financial system. 
After three years of waiting for my sister's return, I decided to go to China to look for her myself. 
And I'll help you out. 
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah? 
I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. 
(Laughter) And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure. 
Most of the time it's a flexible organ. 
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. 
So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide, and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act. 
I was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right, but I've done this now for 30 years, and it has stayed on this exponential progression. 
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you." 
Thank you very much. 
Look for it. Have you noticed it? 
If you like what's going on, show the green. 
Second transformation, dead brought back to life. 
So what's going on? 
And every single one of these companies denies. 
And I thought, she's about to bite. 
And we know that from Spain, we know that "sol y sombra." 
Feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along agribusiness has simply asked, "If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?" 
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days. 
Because, you know, he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time, and he's an illuminated being in my mind, and he's in between reality and virtual reality, so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram." 
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. 
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. 
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. 
So I went home, and I did a little research, and I found some very shocking statistics. 
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?" 
I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. 
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside, the stuff that costs nothing, because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out? 
All right, now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. 
This is what we believe. 
No, we may hang on, despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated, despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo. 
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. 
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. 
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall. 
But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link. 
But how should we honor Feynman? 
We transform the world, but we don't remember it. 
So that was a normal working ship. 
So these events in our recent past really are unique. 
Thank you very much. 
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea. 
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ... 
Let's see if we can't design a European agora, not simply for products and services, but for our citizens, where they can work together, deliberate, learn from each other, exchange between art and cultures, where they can come up with creative solutions. 
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget. 
I spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms. 
But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?" 
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. 
So Tony starts doing his homework. 
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it. 
We're not even in the top 10. 
Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000. 
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. 
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio, and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy. 
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel, who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii, and he's an expert magician, and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, "Net of Magic." 
And that really describes information technology. 
And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be, was based on these reefs without any fish. 
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you. 
What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. 
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. 
Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented. 
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. 
If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something. 
This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown. 
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. 
This is the language of sterility. 
Take the example of flutes. 
Imagine you had one second per product category. 
The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography. 
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. 
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. 
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach. 
(Laughter) (Applause) This technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. 
There's another case called the McDonald case, where some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings, which were supplied by Gaddafi, sued, and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya. 
They said, "The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist. 
So artist books have a lot of definitions. 
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing? 
So no gavage, no force feeding, no factory-like conditions, no cruelty. 
And what's funny -- at least if you're six years old -- is that the coyote's totally fine too. 
They're also able to reason at high levels. 
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this. 
And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas, so supercritical CO2 or helium, and that goes into a turbine, and this is called the Brayton cycle. 
And it's clearly in the area of finance. 
(Laughter) These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain, until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace. 
We don't replace teachers, by the way. 
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. 
I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. 
It's unbelievable. 
I want you to read this, because we're going to come back to it in a moment. 
I mean look, you can see the necktie, but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little, small atom. 
What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive." 
So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. 
They're really difficult for plants to produce. 
"But I'd get to see them in America." "No." 
But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations. 
And somehow for me, it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much. 
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things. 
(Laughter) And I plead guilty as charged, because all exploration, physical or intellectual, is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression, of crossing boundaries. 
And this isn't just a problem in Britain. 
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. 
All this information is stored for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. 
We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies. 
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors, which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. 
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2. 
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. 
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction. 
So I add some food source to the system. 
And so you can imagine that, as people are performing inside of the museum itself, you get this sense of this emotional connection, this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years. 
It's mostly about things that have big teeth. 
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap. 
And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube, a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. 
I could do nothing wrong. 
(Applause) I'd like to talk about my dad. 
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle. 
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank. 
TG: Well let me tell you, that child will be loyal, and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it. 
But that's okay. 
And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. 
And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy. 
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. 
So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers. 
So as I said, I think bread is a transformational food. 
Feynman loved this story. 
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages, no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using, and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. 
While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. 
We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it. 
In those times documents had hard covers, they were filled in by hand, and they stated your job. 
But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. 
It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life.

What's the take-home message? 
He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. 
We thought our family would already be there. 
So we opened this place. And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in. 
It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present. 
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. 
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars. 
Then other things happened even more abruptly. 
That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain, France and Canada put together. 
I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared, surely they must be discontent in a way. 
I watch reactions. 
Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car? 
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger, one request: Understand that you live in the subjective truth, and so does he. 
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently, but there was the perception that they did. 
That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them. 
It's the beginning. 
There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance, and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.

DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver. 
He liked to take things apart. 
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. 
I got myself to the side of the lake. 
So that's our job. 
I went to see a Dozo chief; he told me about his magical powers. 
And I've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us. 
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum. 
In many developing country cities, more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades. 
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. 
But they were not two characters on two different adventures. 
(Laughter) It's not photoshopped. (Laughter) This is the school, built with the community. 
So let me begin by urging you, particularly you on the youngsters' side, on this path you've chosen, to go as far as you can. 
And then the fully expressive MeBot. 
I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. 
One is reducing their market. What I mean is, it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. 
And that level of complacency means they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture. 
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons. 
But look at the scale of the differences. 
(Laughter) And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols. 
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters, and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. 
Let's find out. 
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son from the fact that I'm a citizen concerned about the country's current situation. 
Regarding the word "patient," when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer, I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here, somebody out there. 
You're just kind of moving around. 
What we call today Islamic Law, and especially Islamic culture -- and there are many Islamic cultures actually; the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. 
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. 
I was crumpled. 
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. 
I didn't have to think about the notes.

We can do it as an outpatient procedure. 
Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. 
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. 
We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic. 
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. 
Well, I say nothing, but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin, Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. 
Those have to pay tuition fees know. 
So we've studied sexually abused women, and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus. 
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ... 
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home. 
And I thought, "You know, that might actually make a pretty good lure." 
Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration. 
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough. 
Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. 
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatically. 
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. 
In China, we have 500 million Internet users. 
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly. 
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter) Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks. 
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease, and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. 
Because the best stories always have a happy ending. 
And from all of this, I can only conclude that people, not just students, are really hungry for this. 
So our work wasn't affected. 
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot. 
We're culture-bound listeners. 
So here's some of the characters that we have. 
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.

Build -- run a special administrative zone. 
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. 
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.

This is our movie. 
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace. 
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis. 
He's smart, he's smart. 
The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility, our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments, from the country to the city, from the tundra to the desert. 
Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.

First, the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. 
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years. 
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. 
So two days later, I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists.

It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball. 
So you guys think you've got a good read on me, you kinda think you know what's up. 
And I think we all found it, simultaneously, an eye-opening and a very frustrating experience. 
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. 
Let me give you one example of this. 
(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. 
Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. 
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here. 
So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water at very high pressures, and this means, essentially, in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel, the coolant would leave the core. 
(Laughter) But I came to a realization about my own ability. 
Joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war. 
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. 
It's just like our English and Dutch example. 
And so that's the case of everyone joining in. 
So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. 
We looked at their desire to cooperate. 
And in the first session, they all said, "This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there. 
By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney, my blood pressure was 40 over nothing. 
So where does it take us? 
My team and I have examined images like this, and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini. 
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. 
All of us have disabilities in one form or another. 
Can you even imagine what that looks like? 
Server: Would you like any desserts, sir? 
Here, the animal gets its food reward. 
We have zero infrastructure. 
(Applause) "The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. 
And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. 
we also allow dogs and things like that, and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company, which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. 
That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. 
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of. 
He's absolutely right. 
They said that "we want freedom; we want democracy. 
That's why the Global knives are so neat. 
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought -- well you know how we all are. 
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads. 
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. 
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do, more is coming. 
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. 
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. 
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does. 
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time. 
And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island. 
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day. 
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament? 
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time, to identify the building blocks that successful families have. 
I was a young driver out on the highway, and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on. 
The brain works by association. 
Okay? That had a big effect on me. 
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound. 
So where does this lead? 
And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic? 
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. 
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world. 
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. 
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda, and the fact that it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention. 
Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. 
Please note it's a museum specimen, but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. 
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century. 
So during the last 15 years, I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke. 
There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. 
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes, and two, it does not look like as expected. 
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images. 
Now, how about your household energy use? 
if you believe in the infrastructure view, then you will say, "Country 1 must be China. 
I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education, are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative. 
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him. 
I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character. 
That would be very boring. 
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will, "Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?" 
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. 
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization. 
Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale. 
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey. 
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. 
It's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web. 
I was having a really bad day. (Laughter) For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions. 
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right? 
And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries, so you can still have a traditional gallery experience, but if you're interested, you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself. 
It was great. It was lots of fun. 
And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time. 
I cannot speak for all my images, so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title. 
She ate too much. She got unlucky. 
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. 
But I think that's unlikely. 
So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. 
Every province had its own market for agriculture. 
It's this combination of liquid metal, molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing. 
So I decided to create a platform for that potential. 
More special people, more special places. 
We cannot afford to lose it. 
But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong. 
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. 
Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. 
You have some people who do. 
So we had our own miniature rainforest, a private beach with a coral reef. 
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works. 
What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks. 
If you have a ticket, and you get a ticket for the shade, you pay more, because you're in a more comfortable environment. 
The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. I had one big problem. 
There are ways to define our interests in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power, we can organize with others in networks to produce, not only public goods, but ways that will enhance our soft power. 
And the interaction is crucial. 
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. 
And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction. 
These are choices that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are going to have before them. 
And, in fact, we've done this. 
It's only about one inch by one inch in size -- pretty tiny. 
Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty, still 2,000 years ago. 
Because we can change the world, we have the ability. 
What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. 
So one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately -- that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore. 
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy. 
In winter, exactly the opposite is happening. 
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. 
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is. 
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. 
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "Tell me how these choices are different from one another. 
But -- and it's a big but -- (Laughter) it turns out, when you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials, that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials. 
circuit boards of the future. 
And whenever he came home, it was a different case. 
The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished. 
Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. 
(Laughter) Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares. 
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again. 
They are not meant to stay. 
So the images that you saw at the beginning, they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle, and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees. 
Today, things are a lot more subtle." 
(Applause) Roy Gould: Less than a year from now, the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy, which marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope. 
It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing, and to have people realize that they're naturally creative. 
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. 
So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet. 
So the question is, how do they deal with this material? 
But like any long length of charged wire, it also inadvertently became an antenna. 
In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts. 
(Applause) And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons. 
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. 
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ... 
Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. 
You won't discover anything. 
That, I think, is movement. 
It's a digital file. 
We now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones, transforming even the presence of refugees in countries, and other ways. 
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website. 
The real tragedy of the last century is this: if you think about the world's population as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor, then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off line. 
You did a great job with the land, the dirt. 
Which will happen around 2020. 
You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner. 
This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968, I was working there collecting data for my thesis. 
So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin. 
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. 
I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in 1650. 
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down -- what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes. 
I came back after two months, and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet. 
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. 
They have no benefits: they don't have social security; they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things. 
And then I ask my students, I've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked, "How many of you doesn't use a car?" 
(Applause) Another example, a beautiful thing happened. 
Because it's about surveillance. 
FG: Yeah, the computer building. 
If they then mixed with each other there, then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside Africa carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world. 
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. 
Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. 
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this? 
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. 
And here's the worst news of all. 
But of course none of that happened. 
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. 
The team leader was Girish Wagh, a 34 year-old boy in [unclear]. 
(Laughter) I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you? 
I would encourage you to become a cyborg. 
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. 
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it. 
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one, created by the pantheon of Hindu gods. 
We get droughts, increased desertification, crashing food systems, water scarcity, famine, forced migration, political instability, warfare, crisis. 
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object, I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward. 
It was sort of a hollow in the ground. 
I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science, it's not. 
So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4, 8, 16, 32. 
But today, that superstar effect is happening across the entire economy. 
Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. 
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. 
They have money and power. 
Yeah. 
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago, nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them, till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands? 
One third of Americans. 
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it." 
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned the concept of "flipping" the classroom. 
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all. 
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. 
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. 
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? 
Same police district. 
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact. 
So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience, I tried to understand: where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy? 
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A, B, C and D labels to talk about them more easily. 
Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. 
And you're very familiar with these networks. 
But what's key here is, the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally -- a picture, a music file, software. 
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels. 
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane. 
And most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them. 
That's where it is on all the time. 
For example, what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn, and then a third of a turn? 
I had this I.S. officer's daughter, who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard, who was raped chatting with one individual, and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine, who was trafficked. 
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus, I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means. And I mean it. 
And one of my most enduring memories is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone." 
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress." 
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design. 
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad, I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. 
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. 
Yes, it's possible to do that. 
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped, or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night. 
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative. 
The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. 
Therefore, we must invest in developing leaders, leaders that have the skills, vision and determination to make peace. 
Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you. 
Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature, but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you're fissioning, not to mention the fact that these burn up. 
This is deeply democratizing. 
I saw there was money in garbage. 
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem, because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys, their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science, and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public. 
And as I went to research that even further, I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis. 
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll. 
(Whistling) (Laughter) ♫ My preacher said, ♫ ♫ Don't you worry ♫ ♫ The scientists have it all wrong ♫ ♫ And so, who cares it's winter here? ♫ ♫ And I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January. ♫ (Applause) Chris Anderson: Jill Sobule! 
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending -- particularly these long-term trends -- you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity, in terms of learning. 
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something. 
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. 
I'm going to go back to today, now, and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is. 
He connected with people who cared about this: nonprofessionals, people with passion. 
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free. 
What is math? 
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body, an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees. 
I'd been successful, but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes, and on that morning, I didn't know it. 
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling. 
And a man says very excitedly, "I was in your gas station a while ago, and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it." 
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence. 
And in order to understand these diseases, we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past. 
And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect. 
And the same is true for the troops. 
So: one, two, three, go. 
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. 
Let it recover, before we start logging again. 
And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter) For some reason, the car drivers are -- they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do. 
One of my first battalion commanders, I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march, And I'm not sure that was real interaction. 
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it. 
Capital purchase items. 
We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said, "Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with, even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization." 
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects. 
He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one, trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital. 
(Applause). 
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. 
I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart. 
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark. 
They work on a shoestring budget. 
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you." 
In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. 
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material, it'll actually crack in two. 
I was born into a family of politically active, intellectual atheists. 
When I started this program four years ago, I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. 
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox, a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us? 
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful. 
It lasted about five years. 
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today, "Watch out, a car," the child will jump in fright, and with a very good reason, because there are more than 10,000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world. 
One day they'll get here. 
RS: That's exactly right. 
And this is very similar to a Q and U example. 
What do you suppose they said? 
So less waste. 
We’re doing the same thing as designers. 
And he considers himself one of the inmates. 
In this table, you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. 
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. 
If you go to nuclear, you do get a big reduction, but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. 
That's the end of that. 
That's pretty much it. 
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. 
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system. 
And some people get 100 percent discount, and some people get 20 percent discounts, and some people get 50 percent discount, etc. 
So we've got these challenges, and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance, make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions. 
Same with automobiles. 
♫ And sit here cold? ♫ ♫ We will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ In lackluster ♫ ♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we've got ♫ ♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ And what of the wretched hollow? ♫ ♫ The endless in between? ♫ ♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫ ♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫ ♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫ 
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda." 
Nothing unusual about that at all, except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor. 
Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now. 
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class, believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now. 
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me, but I have no idea who they are. 
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay. 
But this assumes that our factories are humming because, in 2004, the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant. 
But there's this shift in how information is flowing online, and it's invisible. 
He's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year -- that's less than 30,000 dollars -- and to give the rest to those organizations. 
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe, all the way back in time, almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself. 
A fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube. 
And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote." 
But let me do this. 
Throw a drug at it, and resistant cells will grow back. 
But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first. 
There's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs, with guys falling behind girls. 
ready, just play some time. 
Notice these other, smaller protuberances. 
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up. 
The second big change is that, as all media gets digitized, the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media, meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet, magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet. 
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right. 
And if you don't do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell." 
No refueling means you can seal them up and they're not going to be a proliferation risk, and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores. 
And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had, which is that they're moving these positions -- whether it's Proctor &amp; Gamble or Accenture, whatever -- they're moving a million shares of something through the market. 
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. 
Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh, no matter what you consciously believe. 
So we started exploring this material called ETFE. 
It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need. 
And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don't get it in the same way. 
And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression, I did the only thing I could think of at the time. 
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. 
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility, if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it, and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul, we could put it back the way that it was, because these were temporary materials. 
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air. 
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? 
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. 
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy, rather than against democracy. 
And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness, and that is where desertification is occurring. 
So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. 
When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action. 
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) -- because that's a very good question. 
What they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events. 
And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. 
But, using the language of Galois, we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. 
This is a picture of it. 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. 
This is how we can start to make a protocell. 
And so that's why the death rate did come down. 
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK. 
The second actor, different cast of guys, is the donors. 
I don’t know of any other submersible, or even remote, that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space. 
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. 
We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health; we're really bad at talking about character. 
But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. 
(Applause) Sometimes I go browsing [through] a very old magazine. 
Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero. 
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows. 
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. 
It's a rare condition. 
Or just try this one on for size. 
And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you. 
Who is a professional? 
And there really were no good solutions. 
There I am; I see her coming back, coming up underneath me. 
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. 
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you. 
1851: The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. 
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things. 
Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. 
I would feel the abdomen. 
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job? 
And gratefully, it didn't. 
And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. 
I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. 
And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one. 
So, how did she know that she was right? 
Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert, and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. 
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet? 
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward." 
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. 
So here you have it, grid-level storage: silent, emissions-free, no moving parts, remotely controlled, designed to the market price point without subsidy. 
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted? 
I needed to put it into a context. 
Right. You know what I'm saying. 
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness. 
He started making rubber stamps. 
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere, the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal, perfect realm, where lives God, who is the ultimate judge of everything. 
The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is "you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time." 
And they gave subjects the same wine, labeled with different price tags. 
To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind. 
Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine, and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu. 
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. 
How about this: What if in any situation you could just calculate, look at the choices, measure out which one's better and know what to do? 
They are quite useful for educational purposes. 
Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last 10,000 years. 
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. 
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this? 
Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel, 180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds. 
(Applause) So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers: Thomas Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967, and Sir Roy Calne, who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. 
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars. 
They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. 
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay. 
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes. 
People put buckets out ... 
After a fire, what are you proposing?" 
It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject. 
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. 
You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time. 
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor. 
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food. 
This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. 
Now in 1957, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence. 
But it's not that straightforward. 
Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. 
And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring. 
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends. 
But we also found some non-obvious things. 
Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil. 
Let's just look at something like, you know, solving problems with making airlines safer. 
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items. 
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects. 
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores. 
A mobile phone can change your life, and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom. 
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World." 
Audience: Yes. 
And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement, or genetic manipulation, of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. 
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms. 
It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price, because they weren't even made. 
This is the boy in me getting lucky again. 
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria, as part of their synthesis, they will emit, as a byproduct, nanoparticles into the water. 
Telescopes are like time machines. 
We think the things we make can solve our problems, but our problems are much more complex than that. 
A different pollen signature, if you like, or a different pollen fingerprint. 
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish." 
How did look at the stuff in your life? 
Some of this stuff is hard. 
It started early. 
And then what we get is our first mapping. 
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it, and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. 
(Laughter) This is a liter of oil. 
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. 
So, this was very inspiring to me. 
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. 
The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. 
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity. 
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else. 
Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources. 
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us. 
And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it. 
(Laughter) He said it sort of gleefully. 
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people with full futures. 
Two years ago, she graduated from Connecticut College. 
Everyone is just a little bit mad. 
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second. 
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is, not as a means to an end. 
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? 
And this is the earliest data that I can find. 
And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa, when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. 
It's going to be a place where people can meet, where you can put nature. 
Running horizontally along the graph, is "ecological footprint," which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet. 
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. 
This is the first experiment that we did -- eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student, a six year-old girl, and he was teaching her how to browse. 
I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex, elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. 
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900, only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years. 
So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s? 
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. 
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger. 
As income inequality increases, social mobility decreases. 
Many of you will be thinking, but surely we can still stop this. 
(Applause) Hi. 
And what's crazy -- there's a recession going on, even in Dubai, but you wouldn't know by the prices. 
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases, ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan, which is larger that the planet Mercury, diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. 
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work. 
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food. 
Some battle oppressive governments. 
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer. 
But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law, they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry. 
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past? 
So orchestras, back in the day, were made up mostly of dudes, up to only five percent were female. 
And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do. 
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by, for example, connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration? 
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity, and the nation-state reflected that. 
But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models. 
Now, I want to tell a story, which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition, of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. 
Humans think about our own health in a prospective way. 
So bingo, problem solved. 
And the cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation. 
Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. 
The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity. 
So if he's successful, she won't be the last. 
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes. 
I am writing as well as ever. 
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much. 
And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder. 
Self-discipline: the most important factor for success. 
Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream. 
(Laughter) But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. 
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market. 
(Applause) I love video games. 
So somewhere along the line, we're leaving about 12 good years on the table. 
So role-play is actually, I think, quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences. 
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. 
And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response. 
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda, and we never did. 
It doesn't matter if you fail. 
And so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations, because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for, and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for. 
So let's take a look at the flu virus. 
It talks about mental incest. 
And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles. 
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. 
It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying, "Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now." 
(Laughter) And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand. 
By doing so, you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken, the ever-demanding journey of equality. 
No one wanted non-violent offenders -- and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot -- to be thrown into prison. 
Now when the third group came in, they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers. 
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. 
So let me take it back to Wall Street. 
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans, and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. 
HP: (In Chinese) YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." 
In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard. 
Let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia. 
Here's an example. 
I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. 
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth. 
It said "David, age 10." 
Those are captured in the charter. 
But there's not a lot of science behind that number. 
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce, with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria, and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers. 
For sure, it has opened opportunities. 
This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year. 
What I'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry, fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design, things to cover our naked bodies, into something that we consider art. 
That was us. 
You just need to take small steps, accumulate small wins, keep reaching for that green stick. 
So this to me became the important question to answer: how many neurons does the human brain have, and how does that compare to other animals? 
Well, one or two brave souls. 
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature, is utterly simple. 
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. 
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds, and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds, because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future. 
And I said to myself, "I wanna get me one of them." 
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid, really, back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be. 
But look at it this way. 
Because since pre-partition, they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground. 
Actually, it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works. 
It is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream. 
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. 
I was very limited by my condition, physically. 
This is Andrew Archer. 
Now, this is big. 
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources. 
And the disease was all over the world. 
They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history. 
Now, an emerging view that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning, is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion, mood and affect. 
(Applause) Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, three days after the earthquake. 
Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -- that was a genius link. 
You can see their scars. You trust them. 
We'll start a little piece here, and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch. 
Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids: attainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values. 
What does it mean? 
The empire is gone, so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people, and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it? 
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. 
And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing. 
She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids, but nothing will happen, in fact. 
But it made people feel better. 
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work. 
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. 
This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate. 
There are just way too few eye care professionals. 
(Applause) I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. 
And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world. 
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology. 
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. 
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media. 
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone, don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet, don't be on I.M. 
["The 99"] Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold. 
Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other, but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. 
The answer is, don't do things which are different. 
Until then, you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. 
In other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics, when things aren't sustainable, they stop. 
They came to Detroit for a better way of life. 
We are born into a box of time and space. 
I didn't know TED then, but what I did was I closed my eyes tight, and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in, dressed up, looking beautiful, my paintings with all the light, and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show, giving credibility to me. 
Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds. 
It does help us to put perspective on our situation. 
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder. 
I was there not long ago with Miguel. 
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression. 
Some of the studies even say we're happier. 
Then he throws his helmet in the air. 
We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. 
History as an imaging tool? 
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. 
You know what those are, right? 
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong? 
And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. 
And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout -- or whoever took over after Bin Laden -- and he's actually like a terrorist, a sleeper cell. 
I thought that was really weird, as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. 
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up: Where is the Palestinian Gandhi? 
That's the beauty of this economy. 
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee. 
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling? 
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast. 
The next is self-assembly, because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. 
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great. 
That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. 
That implies a lot of trust. 
These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields. 
(Applause) Yeah, yeah! 
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. 
And sometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States. 
We've built a powerful foundation of science, knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives. 
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex. 
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. 
And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg -- he's in his early 20s -- about his cat, about his girlfriend. 
Put your book beneath it and you can read. 
These examples give new hope, new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar. 
(Applause) You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen: HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night. 
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure. 
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time. 
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.'" "Go up" -- aaleh. 
Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain. 
They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full-stop. 
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park. 
And for every hundred dollars, you get almost 30 extra years of education. 
I will tell you by the end of my speech. 
We can't imagine it. 
This is a picture called a cutaway. 
We are talking about the high seas. 
And to make matters even worse, most of the text that we have are extremely short. 
(Laughter) Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers. 
I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth. 
But at any rate, they are there. 
This is important, because in China in 1997, the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. 
Now, this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red, and the New York State forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter) So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee-friendly flowers. 
There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things, and it happened to lots of birds that people loved. 
But when they're playing, they're learning the social order and dynamics of things. 
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change -- and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change. 
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. 
And we don't have any industry at all -- it's only because of this deforestation. 
You see, if you have, over time, reacted negatively to past events and people, neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain. 
For 30 years of his life, he made false papers -- never for himself, always for other people, and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed. 
But what I'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach. 
Because everyone was a hero. 
So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices, but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. 
Now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track. 
Basically, prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector, but it doesn't generate any jobs. 
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward. 
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. 
I study health systems in these countries. 
And we're conscious -- we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions. 
There was no bailout on the horizon. 
I step on the brake. 
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society, even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters. 
Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's 2 x 3. 
Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees. 
Now this didn't make any sense, and like any reasonable engineer or scientist, they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself, it must be the dish. 
It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. 
All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. 
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. 
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different, that I -- you know, I have my own R2D2, but that's -- honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy. 
I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings, but they popped up when I least expected it. 
Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was. 
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ... 
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ... 
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it, like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions? 
What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very, very enterprising. 
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch? 
Indirectly, that's what she tells them. 
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound. 
But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things, so bear with me. 
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. 
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. 
We design unique elements into this. 
(Applause) I also love it because it seems to me that the example, the tools we use to change the world, ought to be beautiful in themselves. 
Haiti is also dark, compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic, which has about the same number of residents. 
This is the philodendron selloum. 
And so they took them to some safe place. 
On the other hand, there's the liking processes, fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back. 
It was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat. 
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Nature's my muse and it's been my passion. 
We don't want to be all the same, but we want to respect each other and understand each other. 
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. 
So it was the slow churn, if you will. 
I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get, I go look for more. 
So this is not balanced. 
I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet -- like to the car, or at school. 
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging. 
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws -- that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source. 
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time, but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China. 
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing, and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point. 
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 
I'm going to pass it around. 
That's one way of looking at it. 
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies, they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. 
So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. 
And stress, worry, anger all decrease with age. 
(Laughter) And so this is part of what life is, but it's not all of what life is. 
We count numbers. 
That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available, and it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity. 
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something? 
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford, really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them. 
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg. 
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. 
Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't, when there was maybe you -- one voice, maybe one or two others. 
So there's a lot of great things, but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting. 
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind. 
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis. 
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com, what you'll see is the video playing above. 
For them, it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human-induced climate change. 
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste: one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes; one pile was treated with bacteria; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. 
And one day we were walking. We were in France. 
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before. 
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa, our second challenge will be, who are the wealth-creating agents in any society? 
And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference. 
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing. 
We saw the food riots in 2008, after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight. 
And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it. 
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. 
So it had its downsides. 
We're becoming impatient. 
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide. 
One goes extinct for the other to survive. 
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface. 
So basically you have a chain of elements. 
It doesn't matter where you are -- Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter. 
There's something else about them that you see -- they don't see themselves. 
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race, because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter) But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing, which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate. 
I have listened to the three previous speakers, and guess what happened? 
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature, but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye. 
That is my job for the next two years, to design an entire master plan, and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course, with so many other people. 
Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds, and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. 
But, how far away is it? 
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. 
And he did a great job in it. 
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military." 
Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. 
The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight, and you're back to the original climate. 
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines. 
See that again. 
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered. 
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. 
Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it. 
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science. 
It's open source. 
There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome. 
When the Model T was launched -- and this is, by the way, all the figures that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices -- Model T was 19,700 by Ford. 
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday. 
And when I gave them to the people, they'd either hold them to their heart, or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. 
And he's right. This is a problem. 
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it. 
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. 
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. 
But how can a cancer spread in a population? 
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length. 
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. 
Now we, as humans, we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. 
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24 who received the assignment to draw the prophet -- 12 of them refused. Did you know that? 
Lots of people are doing things at the same time. 
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here, would be possible without these little micro-machines. 
The relationship between child mortality and family size. 
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. 
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup." 
Likewise in communicable diseases. 
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. 
Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. 
Looks absolutely audacious. 
Here's some data that we collected through our company with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them, in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees, and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape, for even that matter, and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is. 
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology, and in a certain sense, medieval society. 
And why should we care about this? 
And that was a surprise to me. 
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. 
(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games like animals, and I listen to music. 
(Laughter) But what they do have is incredible social skills. 
Together we can make our beds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. 
And now we've got the words, and we can apply the special sauce: the translation. 
We work with a fourth technology. 
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra. 
If you won, she would marry you. 
This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. 
We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. 
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced. 
And he takes this one. 
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question, "What can we learn from this organism?" 
So, they first create this foundation of equality. 
She left. 
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra started an experiment. 
I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. 
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity? 
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today, the key for you, is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused. 
And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective, we're going to be able to manage this process. 
My mother, growing up, she called it the "idiot box." 
When it gets to about 160 degrees, the proteins all line up and they create structure, the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread. 
And at the time, people actually answered that question positively: "Yes." 
We can harness those benefits. 
This is change-blindness. 
Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information. 
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the surgeon is his mother. 
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion, moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows, looking at interesting things in the world. 
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes. 
This is Tamdin. 
Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love -- your iPhone -- as his brain. 
What this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens. 
So a few weeks after my diagnosis, we went up to Vermont, and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. 
And in this case, they did. 
I remember well the meals of my childhood. 
And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it, we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program. 
There are many people who have helped me in my life, and many that I haven't met. 
(Laughter) Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass, underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed. 
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with, like many communities similar to it, is that there's no shared, collective investment in the future of rural communities. 
And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be. 
Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice. 
Thank God I announced the locations and everything. 
You can't cross that envelope, which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars. 
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself. 
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer, had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived. 
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations. 
A lot of it didn't pan out. 
But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable, over the next 5 to 10 years. 
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. 
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions. 
Michael's a young guy. 
And it works like this -- this doesn't actually produce any sound. 
This directive says that each phone company in Europe, each Internet service company all over Europe, has to store a wide range of information about the users. 
(Applause) So they're broadcasting this live. 
So think of this as a choose-your-own-adventure of an album. 
The average price of a human being today, around the world, is about 90 dollars. 
And I thought I could blend in. 
If you go look at their website today, they'll actually list these specimens, saying, the rest was lost in a fire. 
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us. 
And parallel to my cutting is my running. 
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand. 
And I hope, if nothing else, I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. 
So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that, you're actually just not spending it right. 
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose. 
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. 
(Applause) Now this attraction to objects doesn't just work for celebrity objects. 
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern, but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then. 
My studio in Bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest, and monkeys, of course, are supposed to be the happiest of all animals. 
And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic. 
It's a great place to start if you have questions. 
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?' and take action to make it now." 
Thank you. 
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"] So that's a pretty strong comment there. 
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had. 
And the next bar over, the [red] line, says if your friend's friends are obese, your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher. 
So we began this journey, and we launched it in 1999. 
I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying. 
And they tasted really good. 
And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane. 
Now in China, you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known, that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites. 
We became bald-bodied, oddly enough; for one reason or another, they didn’t. 
And the main players are over 35, and are female. 
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. 
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby, the baby will do the same. 
But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. 
JA: I'm not sure about the incident. 
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes -- much longer than before -- because they're levitated. 
So, let's make it right in our own backyard. 
I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13. 
Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. 
The decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life. 
We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red, and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. 
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also. 
Xigi is a new community site that's built by the community, linking and mapping this new social capital market. 
Everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here. 
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show are the spacecraft, so I'm going to bring the interface back up, and now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. 
I've traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have. 
Most of these don't contain DNA, but yet they have lifelike properties. 
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter) And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. 
One of them told me, "Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea. 
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. 
And you can be secure even if you don't feel it. 
Indra, a hundred. 
We fly about a mile above the surface. 
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. 
(Music) Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas. 
It's like, as many times as the virus changes its clothes, it's still wearing the same socks, and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks. 
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. 
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software. 
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated, was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. 
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge, and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking. 
But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. 
This mouthing behavior, on the right, was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!" 
You can create one out of Legos. 
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing. 
For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient. 
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. 
That's the second half of cognitive surplus. 
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story. 
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. 
Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate, who voted differently. 
(Laughter) It's beautiful, isn't it? 
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises, this thing, "Click, clack click click click," steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter) You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer. 
He's a graduate student in philosophy, and he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours, the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career, to advise people on how to have the best, most effective career. 
We see that look that the mother has on her face, looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal, where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely. 
I'm going to become a crotchety old lady.

What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data. 
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference. 
We make things glow. 
(Laughter) FG: Anyway, the Siza thing. 
Finally, 15 years ago, the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star, and we actually did pretty well. 
It's libraries. 
And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges, because she's determined to go to school in New York. 
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. 
You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself. 
Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. 
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. 
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. 
That's Hollywood for you. 
But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive. 
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. 
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing. 
Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. 
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave. 
And at that time, there were those 544 seafarers being held hostage, and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience. 
That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues, we get to, wow, the zero zone. 
But this phenomenal project's been happening. 
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. 
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. 
Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive, but we still had to make the economic case. 
Video: (Music) DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. 
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is. 
I wonder what the future will hold. 
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years. 
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. 
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. 
It would be artificial intelligence. 
And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think, is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs, and for people that care about food and cooking, is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food. 
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. 
It features two of these deep rovers, and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. 
Well, it's a good reason. 
The last 10 years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans, as I said, teams of lawyers, MOUs, creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board. 
And that's the country where I come from; that's Turkey. 
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics. 
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this. 
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier, to use in the future should you need it. 
And it gets quiet. 
If I do one magic trick move followed by another, the combination is a third magic trick move. 
While he still held that worldview, I was 16, I got the best lawyer in town, my older brother Karthik, and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa, from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined, I'm going to be curious, I'm going to learn something new every day, I'm going to be very hard working, and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially." 
But when you do, you don't get what you expect. 
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. 
But it will also lay waste to imagination. 
David. 
It is the only Germanic language that requires this. 
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self. 
So what does this tell us? 
I can't wait to find out what it looks like. 
All my relations. Thank you. 
So to him, they were just blocks. 
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed. 
He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like. 
Imagine a thing this high of cogs, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they've got numbers on them. 
On my first day, I went to a restaurant, and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. 
Is walking the course essential to the game? 
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent. 
And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. 
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research. 
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars, and they're buying them as fast as we can make them. 
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect, not only their own control again, be captain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health care cost explosion, doubled demand and things like that. 
When her mother fell sick she said, "Sunitha, you have so much of contacts. 
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK. 
How about this week? 
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. 
after only one trip. 
We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I'll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. 
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA. 
Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities, like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank -- entities that exist only in our own imagination. 
They're here, getting better and better every day. 
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. 
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well, because the same equipment -- phones, computers -- let you consume and produce. 
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. 
And we have a tendency, as a society, to look at that and go, "So what?" 
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. 
Well, it was basically frustration. 
So I went back to Professor Cilliers, and he said, "Go to the library." 
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. 
And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. 
It is simple and complex. 
He lost badly but every Democrat does. 
And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with, notice, the same basic traditional culture, and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism. 
You heard about neuromodulators earlier. 
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do. 
And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow. 
I said that, "We are going to win. 
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make, so basically it pays for itself in about a month. 
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore." 
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States. 
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do. 
Forgot this. 
I love that phrase. 
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter) And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. 
It turns out when a baby's born now, they put an RFID bracelet on the baby, put a corresponding one on the mother, so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward, an alarm goes off. 
It will be the size of a single, small atom. 
Kismet: (Nonsense) Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. 
Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart. 
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away, it would be moving away faster. 
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice, one for yourself and one for others. 
So what happens to all these toxins when we die? 
We fly people on wires, like this. 
And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change. 
And this man, he's every man -- your grandfather, your uncle, your father, your son, your neighbor, your professor, your student. 
Is this doable in your community? 
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"] An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do. 
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. 
(Applause) I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender. 
I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. 
This shows that in this very simple example, which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing. 
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. 
My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side, verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic. 
But that's only half of the story. 
But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years, until I reached my mid-30s and I thought, "You know, I'm not getting any younger. 
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing. 
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant, you could actually just drain the core into what's called a sub-critical setting, basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers. 
Let's start with business. 
In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. 
So a classic experiment here, in that what we did was we moved the sun. 
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes, and I need this job, I've got to go." 
(Laughter) Who has an answer for Charlie? 
And this one is focused on creative and media industries. 
If you have something to give, give it now. 
The point isn't to live without any regrets. 
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies. 
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites; it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world. 
You've heard of entropy. 
Or is this just right for this place? 
But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon, say it's over on this side, there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see. 
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind. 
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" 
Thank you. 
So despite this being a very well-intended application, obviously there was a side effect of that. 
And they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build. 
But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment. 
However, if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday, if you can imagine this, what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses. 
My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together. 
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. 
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. 
Is biology special? 
We plan to take this highly-stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big -- not in some distant future, but in less than 40 years, in the life time of most of you. 
He lives in rainforests and savannas. 
a button, two guitar picks and lots of hot glue. 
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down. 
Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas, how do we maximize that incentive? 
Our answer, of course, was yes. 
Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. 
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years. 
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- "God, please cure him. 
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy, the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein, and as a result, for the next six months, when you Googled my name, instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this. 
So, there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment, one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these. 
By 19, I was a fully-fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition. 
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. 
And we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare DNA sequences among us here in the room, for example. 
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary. 
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. 
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States. 
On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. 
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient. 
And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health, that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. 
Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. 
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times. 
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question, and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this. 
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries, we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings. 
So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu. 
Quieted the train. 
It's understanding data. 
They'd released a bunch of people, but they still had about 700 people hostage. 
I wrote a magazine, was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. 
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials. 
The air temperature was not too high, but it was not comfortable during these games. 
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not? 
The heat was on. 
We have to stand together. 
We have already an autonomous vehicle. 
(Laughter) Couldn't do it. Could not wait. 
But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. 
Isn't amazing? 
Now I've been to a lot of marathons, and I've yet to see any ... 
(Laughter) I think the box says -- let's see here -- "8 to 12" on it. 
Well, while I was in high school, something happened. 
So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. 
I grew up in a very sheltered environment. 
Most people, a majority of people, say sad. 
Central Manhattan became possible. 
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes, I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item in about a dozen categories, which was a very grueling quest, as you can imagine. 
And mind you, most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves, it is used to cool the base stations. 
Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen. 
Interestingly, it's happened almost entirely without media coverage. 
Now unfortunately, it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. 
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. 
And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it, until we don't have access to it, and then it becomes a gatekeeper. 
I'm talking about teachers. 
"I don't know, put it in the lost and found." 
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci, in case you didn't know. 
The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs. 
JK: Both. 
So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside. 
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. 
So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. 
With a 3D visualization like this, we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn. 
Rules and incentives -- "sticks" and "carrots." 
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. 
Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal. 
Take the travel service Nextpedition. 
It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. 
But now, we have a different kind of comic. 
Because those had been in the news lately. 
So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good. 
I said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly." 
Thank you very much. 
And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital. 
But a lot of other animals weren't saved. 
Above government, above markets was the direct rule of the people. 
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great. 
Some things are not right, and you'll say these words are probably not English words. 
Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. 
I went to chef school in France. 
But what about the conductor? What can you say the conductor was doing, actually? 
I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention. 
And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other. 
Thank you. 
What an exciting and inspiring event. 
(Applause) It's a quite amazing development which has happened. 
We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat. 
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing. 
(Applause) Oh, you've got a question for me? OK. 
Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry, we have a definite lack of -- call me old-fashioned -- human intelligence. 
So I tried. 
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. 
are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy. 
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs. 
They thought it'd be more innovative without it. 
Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance. 
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't. 
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old. 
The prime minister is 12 years old. 
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own. 
It unfolds. 
We're not asking anything that's intangible. 
These are also, these tar-fueled protocells, are also able to locate resources in their environment. 
Stewart Brand: Whoa. 
I sort of friend-married each of these guys. 
So, I'm graduating college and, feeling very idealistic, I decided to join the NGO which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former Soviet Union. 
The first question is this. 
Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content. 
There is a rash of suicide in China. 
And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system. 
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park." 
But after some nagging, I got him to do that. 
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. 
NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts, and last year, they invited us along for the ride. 
Thank you very much. 
They teach them to go work in corporations. 
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses. 
And in the name of connectedness, the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. 
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite, by the way, one millimeter, two millimeters long, not more than that, running quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites. 
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. 
That changes everything, right? 
(Laughter) So, you might say, OK, there are these differences between liberals and conservatives, but what makes those three other foundations moral? 
And finally, in a rather grizzly way, the Bosnia war crimes; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen, which showed that bodies had been buried, exhumed and then reburied somewhere else. 
And you know what? 
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay, Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman, Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti, and on and on and on and on." 
Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. 
Rather than try to figure them out, I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them. 
And it's political. 
Number one question I get asked. 
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. 
So, how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network? 
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die, compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again, this is millions of people, happening every day -- women, in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery, so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode, men explode. 
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles, but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state, people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone." 
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill. 
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. 
He knows who's been there, when they were there. 
Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. 
And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine, but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there. 
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. 
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator, and he was convicted. 
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines. 
The lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down." 
His body is in prison, but his mind is free. 
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read. 
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. 
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word. 
So that's kind of a bold statement. 
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, which, as some of you may know, is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy. 
It works in three steps. 
I want to compete. 
She sent money back to her family. 
The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth, rather than a facilitator of economic growth. 
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before. 
And unlike the juicy salif, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain, rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain. 
While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? 
Mom, I'm really trying. 
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. 
And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder. 
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. 
You can ask questions like, "Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?" 
Our big break came in 2004. 
So I didn't come to papercutting in a straight line. 
Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. 
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones. 
And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. 
And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature? 
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED, and they said, "No, you won't." 
The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now. 
And this would then combine two basic functionalities: illumination and wireless data transmission. 
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page. 
But also, don't shop. 
And they thought about it and they said, "Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here." 
So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits, the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. 
So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes, I show people what those outcomes will get you, in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500, 2,000 dollars per month and so on. 
See, why not? We celebrate birthdays, where all you have to do is not die for 365 days — (Laughter) — and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it. 
We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script. 
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. 
So what do you do when everything is out there? 
While I was preparing my dog for the run, a man was finishing drinking at a bar, picked up his car keys, got into a car and headed south, or wherever he was. 
And he said, "This genetic resource," -- and I'll never forget the words -- "stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine." 
So the technician takes the instructions. 
The other thing is that it's about professionalism. 
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said, "What's interesting about you is you." 
But these are people who have been radicalized, because, thanks to the one child policy, they have lost everyone in their next generation. 
So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters. 
So we only grow what we need. 
Linearity means higher quality sound. 
So that's the conventional approach. 
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. 
This a place where the dead are brought in. 
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently, through its actions in Hong Kong, did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century. 
(Applause) UE: Thank you very much. 
And the animal comes back for a food reward. 
I want to know what I know." 
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry. 
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed. 
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again, and as a result, working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts, we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press, with the strongest journalistic protections in the world, with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. 
More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models. 
We could run really far on a hot day. 
She was married against her will at age 13. 
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re-inhabited as art-space. 
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? 
So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments, we will master these and new tools of vaccinology, and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives. 
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore. 
In a study done by Green Park, who are a British senior exec supplier, they said that over half of the FTSE 100 companies don't have a nonwhite leader at their board level, executive or non-executive. 
Well, I first began to understand this when I was 14 years old. 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. 
And remarkably, that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago, when they invented cooking. 
Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy, you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy. 
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation, and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture, which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work. 
And in 1945, he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly. 
It'll never happen. You don't have enough money. 
But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar. 
And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down. 
Each individual's cortex is folded differently, very much like a fingerprint. 
So, what have we learned from this about cheating? 
We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. 
And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific, it's slavery. 
This is our current detector. 
From this, we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse, and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse. 
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. 
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years, have taught me what entrepreneurship is. 
Jung may have called it "the subconscious." 
You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing, but it costs you something to do it. 
I'd spoken to all the experts. 
And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit. 
And you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back, the cycles of hunger and eating, waking and sleeping, laughing and crying would emerge as pattern." 
Remember him -- old philosopher? 
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. 
We're used to support groups being beneficial. 
So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return. 
Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer. 
And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. 
Because I wasn't believing in me, really me, all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us. 
Audience: T, E, D. 
Basically for the amount of money that we spend, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in prevention. 
And that energy is what powers fusion. 
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration. 
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead. 
They rock the mic outside my window every morning. 
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true. 
(Laughter) So, I know what you're thinking: "That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?" 
In the sorts of countries I work in, that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent. 
That's the border. 
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum, let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned. 
(Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. 
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures: there are fewer male teachers. 
And what the hell does that mean to you? 
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other, and sometimes even like what we see. 
That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way. 
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders, the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada, whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view. 
And I mean books everywhere around the house. 
I have no more reason to blame myself. 
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway. 
What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -- phoniness, false sophistication, jargon. 
For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one. 
If you feel that way, that's a utilitarian choice. 
Also inside the envelope was money. 
The average household spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets. 
The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political, social and economic issues affecting the Net. 
And really you do the same thing. 
That's the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left missing in action, and they say the results described here "might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead." 
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. 
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS -- all of these guys will be there. 
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity, turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field, turn it back into electricity, and then you can use it. 
Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right? 
So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. 
So here's the next challenge. 
The systems are not there to reach the people. 
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. 
None of the glamour that you see today existed. 
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. 
That might be true, but it's not terribly relevant. 
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. 
(Laughter) You know that teacher? 
He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the U.S. 
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard. 
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. 
And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego, because Lego -- the Danish -- no, they're not into guns. 
And I say to you, I might not stick to this, but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo. 
We can download new diagnostics. 
It's 16, 16, 16, 48, 4,800 -- 4,800, the answer to the sum. 
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? -- it really is quite phenomenal. 
They can even taste with their wings. 
There they are. That's 23,000 companies. 
The name means "edge of the desert." 
This region right here is the reactor. 
Through cultural changes, our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives. 
And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. 
Basically, she's a deejay. 
Benjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world. 
It doesn't really matter what the statements are about, what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority. 
The problem we have in believing that is -- you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. 
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. 
All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. 
Thank you so much. 
And so when you go to the memorial, you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves. 
I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew, and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. 
Well, unlike a normal album, we haven't been able to accommodate this request. 
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you." 
We try to cash in on it. 
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see. 
She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments. 
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. 
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives. 
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. 
It was chaotic. 
I've been building topsoil. 
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart. 
Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them. 
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys. 
We decided to give back locally. 
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration, and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator." 
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled. 
Both countries are in Asia. 
Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities for public affairs. 
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know. 
And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity, comparatively speaking. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. 
Thanks. 
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. 
The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years, but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good. 
It's also tastes and smells. 
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater. 
I interview and do portraits. 
Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child. 
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls. 
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?" 
And there's another cognitive bias I'll call confirmation bias, where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. 
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die. 
Doesn't tell you much about military power, doesn't tell you very much about soft power. 
Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch. 
I try to share this everywhere I go. 
Now, one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do, in general. 
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. 
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise. 
So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work. 
And then the cliche came to haunt us. 
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language. 
(Laughter) And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills, which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States, attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications. 
The person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer, who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group, Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started, but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru and other places around the world. 
I went in for the CAT scan, and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs. 
(Applause) I didn't always love unintended consequences, but I've really learned to appreciate them. 
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. 
What goes around always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods. 
Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. 
And if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short. 
We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another. 
As a Latin American, and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world, I would recommend, respectfully, passionately, to those countries which are yet to urbanize -- Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 -- I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize, such as India which is only 33 percent urban now, that governments should acquire all land around cities. 
What I'm involved with is the transition response. 
I'm going to show you six, if I can, solutions for helping to save the world. 
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. 
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor. 
Peter: The greatest benefit to all. 
It's not different, it's the same stuff: calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate. 
And so he suggested a machine, and he called it the memex. 
Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles, and that there are other ways of coordinating the value, they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages -- (Laughter) -- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness: denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance. 
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. 
But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. 
Imagine if we didn't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night. 
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. 
That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran. 
They've had some speakers there. 
It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air. 
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military, but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. 
That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. 
On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals; on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates. 
(Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. 
Let's give them a hand. 
Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect. 
So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes. 
It's not as sophisticated as the language of The Wall Street Journal. 
Here's an application that I created for the iPad. 
Some people nodding yes. 
We were seeking normal human brains. 
But cars are really more than a passion of mine; they're quite literally in my blood. 
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier. 
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum. 
There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias and that's in the space of gender in the 1970s and 1980s. 
So with gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life. 
So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence. 
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you. 
That's it. The task is finished." 
Early on its development, they did a very small trial, just under a hundred patients. 
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility. 
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing. 
And we, at the moment, in our society, have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. 
I co-edit, along with a collective of other super-smart, amazing women, a site called Feministing.com. 
There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; it's called the James Webb Telescope, and it will be launched in 2018. 
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair, skin and nails -- and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms. 
And the fish also were happy to be there. 
We weren't anywhere close to the top, but we were on the list, we were somebody. 
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. 
So how does this transition idea work? 
And as we held on, and we breathed as one, we knew we weren't on this journey alone. 
These are pigeons in Rotterdam. 
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA, which was purposed last year, which did not pass. 
SW: What about the other birds? 
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? 
So what do you do when the information is all around you? 
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process. 
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur. 
They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. 
Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain, including in attention, arousal, reward, and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD. 
So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered, it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob, and I didn't believe what I was hearing. 
And then there are some friends calling me, and they call each other. 
Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. 
How do you design that nozzle? 
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push. 
So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election, December 28. 
So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. 
It's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest. 
I opted in for three surgeries, and one of them was experimental. 
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way. 
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras. 
They are skating. They are doing street plays. 
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. 
Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. 
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. 
So right now, the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains, and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu. 
Think of the expense, the human cost of that. 
(Laughter) But one of the great things about the search for massive primes, it's not just finding the primes. 
Thank you. 
While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?" 
New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still. 
(Laughter) And there is another example: aphids. 
So this thing right here is freaking me out. 
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown. 
Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Even in the slums of India more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools. 
We're not trying to solve the problem. 
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating. 
(Laughter) it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people. 
Now, what is the beauty in it? 
This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution. 
So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return, the good that can be driven could be astonishing. 
And this is a bit hard to justify I think. 
Without water, the bacteria won't survive. 
They must know three things: They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head. 
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other. 
It's going to require innovation. 
I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere. 
(Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. 
It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with, you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP. 
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study. 
Can you see that one? 
But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. 
I'll give you one example. 
But most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals, which are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty. 
It tracks your movement through space. 
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do. 
And I believed I could do it. 
In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. 
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. 
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end. 
And this is my house. 
Just look how many. 
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?" 
It also meant, then, if you can imagine this, that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in. 
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion. 
And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. 
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need, I don't know, a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round. 
Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the 60s and 70s and 1980s. 
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure," which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. 
And then the next line over says if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese, your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher. 
See, that is an empowered patient -- no medical training. 
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus. 
And that's because shipping has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel, so they use something called bunker fuel, which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery, or just one step up from asphalt. 
The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. 
We all know it was an amazing movie, and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it. 
Wake up. 
Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee. 
We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. 
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food. 
It's pretty hot. 
Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade: copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold. 
The only thing I had to do was go out, pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection. 
So I'd like you to do something for me. 
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. 
One way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks, and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy. 
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy. 
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. 
(Laughter) But basically I love being a woman. 
The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. 
And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. 
(Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. 
The people who actually have no money, who have no extravagant budget, but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay, but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible English. 
But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. 
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen. 
It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves, and with threatening noise like this going on, your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body is telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous." 
What would happen if authors, or people with ideas could use version two, which comes out on Monday, and use it to organize people who want to talk about something. 
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way. 
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust, well you really need a lot of positives to upset that. 
There are thousands of suppliers in there." 
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest. 
Just spread it as wide as possible. 
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms -- if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated, you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. 
It's from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors, which, when I started digging into them, it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples couselor. 
There is a cost of compression. 
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless, because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive. 
But you think about other things. 
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. 
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. 
What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. 
There's not a lot of science behind that one either. 
It's not telling the parents, "If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated." 
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that. 
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. 
You can make your own purpose. 
The answer is it matters quite a lot. 
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. 
You get grassroots solutions, things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. 
We care how we make our profit. 
If you're a senior person at UNESCO and someone says, "So what are you doing to eradicate world poverty?" 
And we can see places where stars are forming, like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. 
And when I'm on my bike, I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. 
And now you know why I'm fun at parties. 
This one in particular sticks in my mind, because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. 
And there's another difference too, which is the object on the left is made from one substance. 
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet. 
Health extension workers can help with so many things, whether it's family planning, prenatal care, immunizations for the children, or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery. 
You can calculate the price of that water. 
(Music) (Video) Johnny Cash: ♫ There ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ There ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ When I hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ I'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ Ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body ... ♫ (Applause) AK: What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. 
I don't know. Can fish play the piano? 
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled. 
So we came up with a great solution: train grandmothers. 
But the patent for underwater flight -- Karen and I, we were looking at it, some business partners wanted us to patent it -- we weren’t sure about that. 
It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate, to enter the most vital arenas of human life, the most sensitive and the most frightening, the ones that we never want to go to, but when we do go there, we feel incredibly transformed when we do. 
Well the answer, of course, is, if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country, you co-opt almost everybody. 
This is the machine below Geneva. 
The population explosion was unstoppable. 
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems. 
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. 
It has 360-degree views. 
And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter. 
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. 
Do we stop there? 
But we're talking about perception here, right? 
Burma didn't succeed. 
In fact, on all these discs there were documents. 
But it was obvious to me, right? Buy low, sell high. 
And I'm sure you have lots of questions, which I very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you. 
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable. 
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't. 
I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. 
(Applause) Trees epitomize stasis. 
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell, the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials, until maybe now when it might just matter. 
But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process. 
But then the question is: Why don't we? 
And in fact, one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Dubrovka Theatre siege in Moscow in 2002, which probably a lot of you, unlike most of my students at ADFA, are actually old enough to remember. 
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position. 
And mythology does not pay, well, until now. 
So it was all about the data. 
And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n. 
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer. 
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed, because when I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. 
And just down the road, this is JET. 
I'm going to do some cuts. 
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. 
It's a way to bring power to the developing world, because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap. 
Could we leverage the cloud? 
You can still see the little people way down there. 
So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again, and you might notice in the bottom, we can't actually see the cyclist yet, but the car can: it's that little blue box up there, and that comes from the laser data. 
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. 
Now that's a big abstract number. 
The private sector has a role. 
I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Berlin. 
So that begs the next question. 
But where does this sound, commonly described as a click, come from? 
In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they've been on a diet. 
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish. 
I mean, here's a guy who says that your God is a false God. 
It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe, and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea. 
So, here's the cause. 
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers. 
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. 
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. 
Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about, because I am of a certain age where, when I started in my career, believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me: "Why aren't you in the carpool line?" 
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. 
And I think to harness science optimally, to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed, we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt. 
You can ask about what causes it biochemically: neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff. 
We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy. 
He was wrong. 
(Applause) I want to address the issue of compassion. 
But there are a lot of similarities. 
It's not really a conscious decision, "I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this." 
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese -- and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this -- the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. 
The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way. 
Because there's huge opportunities in that. 
It snows so heavily there, the installation was almost immediately buried. 
"So it's 10 years from now," I said, "and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here. 
Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her. 
It was an experimental education program. 
It's like aliens have taken over my brain. 
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. 
Our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes. 
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators? 
When Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix," her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated, she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan. 
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. 
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on. 
On one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. 
We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. 
But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material -- except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. 
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. 
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas, for example, the auditory system and the motor system, so for treating deafness and for motor disorders. 
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her. 
♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫ ♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫ ♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫ ♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫ ♫ Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫ ♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫ ♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫ 
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. 
And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully characterize, even by modern methods, and the product looks brown, like this tar here on the left. A pure compound is shown on the right, for contrast. 
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. 
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear. 
The first, to my mind, is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived." 
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition. 
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations. 
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response, which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. 
The film hasn't even been distributed yet. 
It's not about making things that have the most media attention, but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good. 
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. 
Once we have language, we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn't have before we acquired it. 
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason, which is itself punishable by death. 
We'll give them a paper test -- no computers, no talking to each other, etc." 
Don't give them four, give them two plus two. 
And I realized then, I wasn't either. 
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results, so I'm just going to talk to you about one. 
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave -- going into protests as a couple of hundred, getting beaten up and arrested. 
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. 
And that fascinated me, because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life. 
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system. 
A little bit further on in the article it said "a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace." 
So for those of you who seek to be famous, we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures, authors, actors and so on. 
The sporting goods industry, in particular, stepped up to the plate and have done it. 
And the Fowler apple is described in here -- I hope this doesn't surprise you -- as, "a beautiful fruit." 
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. 
(Laughter) I don't want to romanticize aging. 
I believe this has got to be, in part, a building ecology problem. 
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. 
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? 
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been. 
And then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store. 
(Applause) I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. 
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them, follow one or the other of two pathways: First through early discoveries, a problem is identified and a solution is sought. 
I mean, as girls, we start off feisty -- "Yeah, who says?" 
Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment. 
Seventy-two. 
Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere. 
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001. 
So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing. 
(Applause) The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool? 
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places. 
This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century, in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. 
I'm going to do that in two steps. 
It does a little double dance, and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place. 
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes, we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. 
The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. 
All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period, there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home. 
The first one is the famous one, the printing press: movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s. 
Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles. 
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster. 
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless. 
Let us accept the choice of the people. 
And that's too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change. 
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it, but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on, to ruin every relationship I've ever had, so be careful what you wish for. 
But you've got to -- yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ... 
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues, I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells, adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway. 
And he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act." 
And they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on. 
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars. 
I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. 
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. 
It is reflected in the political statements. 
Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency. 
This is the spruce Gran Picea, which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods. 
This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive. 
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned. 
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood. 
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world. 
And they had already started building the sewers in London, and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. 
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases, often sitting in their computers, and actually, currently not shared. 
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. 
They're far closer together than that." 
Let's look at some suggestive facts. 
Public space. 
And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. 
Notice one thing, we're equal here. 
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. 
But we launch plutonium batteries all the time. 
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes. 
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were. 
And I finally have stabilized. 
(Applause) So why do we learn mathematics? 
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. 
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. 
This institution is government-backed and it has been the case for the past three decades. 
Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world. 
They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. 
I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra, an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali, and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. 
So they introduced me to five families. 
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? 
Let me just tell you two really quickly. 
It was only because of our passports. 
And if you look at another factor, another contrast, a slave back then is worth about $40,000 in today's money. 
And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. 
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. 
So already you can see there are contradictions. 
(Laughter) So at the moment of conception, they're doing little butt exercises. 
It doesn't need light. 
Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries, if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. 
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people, not just a few people. 
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated. 
This woman is an extraordinary grandmother. 
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. 
Our fate and the ocean's are one. 
PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations? 
So now, the thing is that this is a different kind of spell. 
It was amazing. 
In birds, life gained new mobility. 
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time. 
And it seems like it's happening all the time. 
(Applause) So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other. 
And when I met her, she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, into Nepal, across to India -- 30 days -- to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama. 
Diets may seem harmless, but they actually do a lot of collateral damage. 
We develop better decision-making ability if we play more. 
And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. 
And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. 
This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West, at least. 
Now I'll tell you, as a Middle Eastern male, when you show up around a lot of these activities, you start feeling guilty at one point. 
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. 
It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it's ready, when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes. 
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out. 
In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place. 
But I don't really believe in architectural problems; I only believe in opportunities. 
So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish. 
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? 
Richard Feynman was a very complex man. 
If you're in Northern Europe or North America, you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. 
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. 
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand," go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. 
Does it match one African or the other African? 
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record? 
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem? 
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. 
This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. 
It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo, almost three decades ago. 
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. 
The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. 
It's the ones that play more. 
So if we want to help the orangutans -- what I actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit. 
This was the reality which I saw, and not only one project like that: I saw, I would say, over the years I worked in Africa, I saw hundreds of projects like this. 
And so they put this together, a list of all the species, where they're known to occur, and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise. 
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture, so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food. 
And some of us might even sing. 
Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts. 
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. 
Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects? 
Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between Salinas and Monterey. 
RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't. 
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway, the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. 
And so, the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool, which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. 
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented," because their focus is what is now. 
You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth. 
Dr. Yunus shared his story, explaining what that was, and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. 
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. 
Let me tell you a bit about it. 
When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. 
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes. 
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding, new opportunities for action begin to emerge. 
We consider first that life has a body. 
It was made of glass, and this building really helped me to do my job good. 
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators! 
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against. 
There are, in fact, a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods. 
All of our patents, our entire approach to patents and invention, is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for; we can say what it's for. 
See? They have done it. 
That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories, it's probably not going to impact our lives at all. 
Who is that going to come from? 
No way. We're different." 
So they tracked their own private currency, and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted -- all organized by the players themselves. 
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection, while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. 
They live about seven good years longer than the average American. 
We need to put money where it can productively grow. 
We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced. 
Radio could carry sound without wires. 
And why was I fascinated? 
And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma? 
Why does it cost so much energy, then? 
(Laughter) So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor. 
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa. 
And so we were working to sequester carbon. 
And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives, the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs. 
We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension. 
How do we help people like that? 
(Laughs) I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are. 
You and I can go on and buy it for them. 
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said, "We want visitors to actually cease being visitors. 
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change? 
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations. 
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work. 
It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys. 
He told me not to tell anyone. 
Can you see it? 
I'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments. 
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. 
We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard of this expedition. 
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization. 
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?" 
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up. 
And it's best understood through example as the science of those crazy, wacky newspaper headlines. 
On this side was men, and then the barrier, and this side was women. 
Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day, his dream job, and he said that he had quit his job because of me, because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family, and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. 
I had head injures. I had internal injuries. 
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. 
I call it the iPatient. 
We know it's there by its gravitational effects. 
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. 
You know, thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man-made causes and the natural causes. 
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. 
You can get horns, antlers -- even, if you look close, cloven hooves. 
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. 
They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz. 
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety." 
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. 
And you see why. You see why. 
And so this is a photograph from the 1950s. 
It's like a consenting intellectual S&amp;M activity. 
It's a circular thing. 
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop. 
But now, what does religion have to do with it? 
Have advocates keep a set in their car. 
Great people have made commitments -- we will protect our children from want and from fear. 
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us. 
All this still persists. 
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic. 
And both in the production of plastic, the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic, the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people. 
And this is before the Internet got really big. 
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares, it's we, life, who are searching. 
I was showing the film, and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything. 
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. 
We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a "Critic," that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. 
Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011. 
So I was on a national television prime-time show. 
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no, procreation is not the only purpose of marriage; what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment? 
Or you can be transcendental future: namely, life begins after death. 
I've met women and men all over this planet, who through various circumstances -- war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence -- have never known security, or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. 
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living. 
I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. 
I will come to it later. 
These are children like Umar. 
So they'll probably think it's five years away. 
And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. 
I have four kids, and even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had. 
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion? 
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants. 
Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle? 
And he decides to paint her. 
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there. 
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.) MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. 
Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. 
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. 
I called in 26 children. 
Forget about messages; children are the future, and children in the first and second world and, most especially, in the third world need mentors. 
Nobody else did. 
I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her. 
We're not perfect, and that's okay. 
And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. 
So, I will not answer the question. 
And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. 
I tried to understand that language as a beginning, as a place to jump off, and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... 
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks, and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different components that I'm working on, and again, it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. 
So if we want to construct a time machine, we need two things. 
We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. 
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling, as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after, that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching. 
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that? 
I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation, which is sadly very common, especially in the U.K. 
And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address -- child labor in cottonseed farms in India -- this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India. 
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. 
An identity was defined primarily by religion. 
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind, you're a loser. 
But on the other hand, we have 14 billion of these: light bulbs, light. 
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on, and we'd understand very well. 
It had the central fluid, it had the surrounding wall, and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton. 
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is, "What made you interested in this subject?" 
Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots. 
Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. 
Take a good idea and push it on the world. 
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside, and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture. 
(Applause) Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. 
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned. 
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns. 
(Laughter) Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is. 
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. 
Instead of talking about little green men, he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky. 
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can do it in human beings. 
So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain: speech recognition. 
They're wrong. 
That's not the way the West rose, and I don't think it's the way the West will fall. 
Her parents, again, said, "Why should we spend the money on her? 
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. 
It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen. 
Recently, I showed this to my students, and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. 
It comes from information that is freely available and out there, but that we are willfully blind to, because we can't handle, don't want to handle, the conflict that it provokes. 
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky. 
But indeed, that is exactly what we do. 
Huh. Hang on a moment. 
But eventually I started to look human again. 
And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens, asking, "What is the vision of the good life that our products, our design, present to us?", then you often get the shivers, because of how little we expect of each other, of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like. 
(Laughter) Here is the universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists. 
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year. 
It was ending up in landfills. 
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society. 
The self was not constant. 
And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover. 
So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG." 
It's a very powerful principle. 
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. 
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. 
So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers. 
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction. 
I could go to Germany to study. 
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. 
So in such a relational universe, if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured, like this device here, or that device there, or something beautiful, like all the living things, all of you guys in the room -- "guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women. 
You think it's obvious? 
And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these. 
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper, and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages. 
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. 
And they don't get paid that well. 
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it. 
And I'm not like some super taster, you know? 
They have two types of flight muscle: so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated, which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system. 
The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. 
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. 
There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today. 
So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain, when you're really designing for generosity. 
I think the headline in The New York Times was, "Are you packing it on? 
And if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery, their answer would hearken back to President Kennedy's remarks at Rice University in 1962 when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here -- "We choose to work on grid-level storage, not because it is easy, but because it is hard." 
They fly in and they pollinate. 
I'd better clear these up out of the way; otherwise, I’m going to trip over them. 
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. 
And the craft that I’m in -- this hasn’t been shown before. 
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. 
Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place. 
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there and the intervention? 
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth, because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better. 
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. 
We were thrilled to have that kind of audience, and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter) So we got to work. 
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. 
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur, as measured in discoveries per investigator per year. 
I was greedy. 
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. 
Free-styler: ♫ I'm like some kind of [unclear] ♫ ♫ [unclear] extraterrestrial, celestial scene ♫ ♫ Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditate ♫ ♫ With two microphones hovering over my head ♫ ♫ See if I could still listen, spittin' off the sound ♫ ♫ See what you grinning ♫ ♫ I teach the children in the back of the classroom ♫ ♫ About the message of apocalyptical ♫ ♫ Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple ♫ ♫ [unclear] instrumental ♫ ♫ Detrimental playing Super Mario ♫ ♫ [unclear] boxes [unclear] hip hop ♫ 
1994, Rodrigo started something called CDI, which took computers donated by corporations, put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this. 
That's Ken Sharpe over there. 
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master. 
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. 
That's a bad day at the office. 
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. 
(Laughter) Not a lot of people are doing it. 
A final thought: Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers, frustrations and setbacks. 
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak. 
This guy is a little more contemplative. 
And then I measure its altitude. 
We can choose a greener future, and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. 
These are all reality today, and [in] the future, will be evermore possible. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables." 
So we're very excited about M.R. 
And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story. 
Have a listen. 
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. 
Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer, came to me and said, "We need to document this, and here's my proposal. 
They wanted band integration, that is, the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around. 
What if -- (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! 
(Laughter) So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre, I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices. 
Now hands up -- and it's okay -- but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy? 
I'm not on top of the class. 
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. 
When the subject is still very thinly populated, you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority. 
And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract." 
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050. 
Well, they used it. 
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people. 
We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off. 
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair? 
And even cooler, you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. 
And so they can do a simulation like this. 
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid. 
Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors. 
"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. 
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes. 
But not all the vessels have those to date. 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. 
After all, they decide, and they did. 
Then came the second school, the third school, the fourth school and a junior college. 
Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready? 
Now luckily, that particular virus, although very scary at the time, did not transmit from person to person very easily. 
That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence. 
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind. 
Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions. 
And they use light to illuminate space down there. 
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency. 
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. 
Now, you might ask, "Okay, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing? 
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine. 
But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. 
At the beginning of class, I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. 
And for the musicians. 
It was sweet, it was unctuous. 
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly, with 54 co-sponsors, the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date, and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world. 
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted, and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may. 
But I gave them the room to just do the thing. 
But when I'm thinking about the future, I'm actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa. 
His friend, Goro Shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life. 
You learn things unconsciously. 
So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here. 
But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai -- it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. 
Plus you get strawberries. 
I had no idea what I was doing, I had no idea where I was going, but at some point, I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far. 
It hasn't a clue. 
Whooo! 
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy. 
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. 
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. 
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva. 
I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. 
And even more -- and this is something that one can be really amazed about -- is what I'm going to show you next, which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections, real pathways. 
So strictly from a climate change perspective, the cities are already relatively green. 
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital, from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data -- that being probability and statistics. 
Now I'm not advocating for bullies. 
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about. 
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. 
It's not sustainable. 
There's a better photo of it. 
The very first landline telephones, the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. 
And I went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye. 
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall, some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface, creating islands like Hawaii. 
(Applause) People love their automobiles. 
It penetrates the mucosa. 
She loses the check, but she goes home with something bigger and more important. 
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows? 
We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. 
And I absolutely love the periodic table. 
There's air-sea interactions. 
And we didn't really know what to do, so we called her into my office. 
So to this very, very savvy crowd, I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive. 
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. 
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador, and it was after the Gulf War, and I was an instructed ambassador. 
It has lower taxes. 
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness, measuring them, giving them feedback, taking videos in the classroom. 
We can disseminate. 
They've found small objects such as these. 
And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things. 
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. 
And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. 
He was later killed while in custody. 
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark. 
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. 
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley. 
And if they do that all at once, it's like playing poker and going all in right away. 
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly. 
The person who's spraying the O.C. spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on. 
How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species? 
So this pre-clinical study, I think, bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. 
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question. 
And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours -- two million watt-hours. 
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception. 
Dhani has a television show. 
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name. 
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week. 
We didn't really realize that until 1914, when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati zoo. 
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and it was a blast. 
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic. 
And also verify it -- crucial step. 
But media abundance never works that way. 
And as the oceans go so shall we. 
Thank you. 
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type. 
But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be. 
We really have two command posts. 
But they detained me. 
They're not necessarily moving through space. 
It's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award, which is nicknamed the Genius Award, last September, for his discovery. 
In sandpaper, bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. 
You all, I guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. 
Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive? 
The future will be more unpredictable. 
(Laughter) How do you parameterize "mostly"? 
We've lost a lot of paradise. 
It isn't. 
And I'll tell you now, that East Asianers, people from East Asia, are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. 
So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. 
And a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building, and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show. 
They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. 
Then what happens to the waste? 
But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits. 
And I explained my project, and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?" 
And what they want is not to have to do that. 
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately. 
And yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage. 
We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. 
This is a person going for a walk. 
They did it on a scrub board. 
It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world. 
I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. 
I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies. 
So, what I do is honeybee research. 
If you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter. 
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother." 
This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical, social, language, cognitive and psychomotor development. 
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die, always in that order, that's because entropy is increasing. 
So how do you study rap scientifically? 
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels. 
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA. 
All the young people, actually, from the city. 
And finally, she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand, a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland." 
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. 
And every time you turned up to go on a mission, you got paid in dragon kill points. 
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. 
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business. 
And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all, hurt the younger generation, and not only, many of them are demonstrating outside, but I think this is one of our problems. 
Ha ha. (Laughter) If you use that, you can get away with anything. 
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls. 
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?" 
I think it will be great. 
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization. 
So here you see, this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan, and every morning it looks like this all over. 
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want. 
So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. 
MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared. 
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers. 
Because I already am all of those things. 
It enables that conversation to get serious. 
Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, are all down 50 percent. 
He was supporting his wife and a child, and the child was going to parochial school. 
Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. 
It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. 
Take the photos, the portraits, upload it -- I'll give you all the details -- and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. 
It's a stretch of beach we know so well. 
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College, an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. 
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. 
I just put them down like they were in the books. 
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government, among others, is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. 
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? 
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. 
The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape. 
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.' But I was wrong." 
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. 
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership. 
And okay, I wouldn't change it. 
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. 
That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week, because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window. 
Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention. 
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: "What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions? 
And therefore, it's not a matter of opinion. 
The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as I said, it is really central to the way that we think about things. 
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. 
So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand. 
That tells you something really important. 
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand. 
Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years. 
And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign, this is what we need to do now with heart. 
We have been only seeing one side of war. 
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day. 
(Laughter) It could get awkward, right? 
We understand that these will become much more virulent, that what we see today is this interweaving of societies, of systems, fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. 
And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell, you just change the sequence of the staples. 
Einstein was fond of this idea. 
And we've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods. 
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again. 
Let me be clear. 
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. 
There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. 
(Applause) Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times. 
And what I think the world needs now is more connections. 
So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean, but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. 
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children. 
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought, I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring. 
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection, I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic? 
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures. 
I've often wondered, what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era, in the year 2011? 
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old. 
And it can come from biofuels. 
So if I'd have done this in 1994, I could have predicted what Walmart would be now. 
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah, she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video. 
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster. 
Did you guess the one that was dry? 
She's nude. 
More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty. 
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. 
One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. 
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster." 
And here's the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town. 
Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life. 
It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -- connecting communities in London to rural growers. 
And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel. 
This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers. 
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. 
So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs, but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol. 
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. 
I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. 
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. 
First rule: there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society. 
And we talked about swarm networks earlier. 
They were hallucinations, which vanished the moment he touched them. 
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. 
(Applause) I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres. 
So now that you're all experts on protocells, we're going to play a game with these protocells. 
But now we have the answer to our question. 
And what would you say to, for example, the, you know, the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military, and he says, "You know what, you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. 
This is from a global survey. 
So, how about the purchasing? 
And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out. 
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable. 
But you know what? 
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online.

One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. 
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about, that perhaps could have led me suspect something. 
Let's go to 40,000 years before the present, to the time of the cultural explosion, when music, art, technology, so many of the things that we're enjoying today, so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born. 
But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system. 
Because if you only have the Iranian passport, you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms, you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea. 
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously. 
And out of that sense of failure, I remember, I would always examine the patient. 
And, interestingly, complexity is very highly evolved. 
And this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. 
If I could summarize this in one sentence, it would be this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. 
You don't choose the written word.

In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there. 
So here's two questions for you.

We have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of YouTube and social networking to express their stories, share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices. 
So it's exciting potential for this. 
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling, and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic, in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza. 
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. 
What did get me moving was a social interaction. 
On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played, from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be. 
But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra. 
That means their immune systems are compromised. 
(Laughter) Yeah. 
It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means, because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. 
So they would come up with all these ideas. 
(Music) What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed. 
Does this have cumulative effects? 
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students.

Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine. 
In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions, I realized that not one, not one of us, had ever dealt with a similar crisis. 
If you're interested in more information, we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it. 
Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense, and grading became degrading. 
It's literally defining a new field. 
For instance, sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. 
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. 
And finally, to real life-changing applications, such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. 
The live duck mounted the dead duck, and started to copulate. 
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.

We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water. 
So many more people would have been affected. 
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist. 
And now they have a third daughter, and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. 
That's my father. 
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you. 
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?" 
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical? 
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics.

Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends. 
My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans. 
So this little guy has found himself this babe, and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her. 
Of course, we can't know what will happen. 
I mix them together, add a little bit of salt water, and then add this long strand I was telling you about, that I've stolen from a virus. And then what happens is, you heat this whole thing up to about boiling. You cool it down to room temperature, and as you do, what happens is those short strands, they do the following thing: each one of them binds that long strand in one place, and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place, and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together. 
This is explicitly showing you how things scale, and this is a truly remarkable graph. 
That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story. 
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. 
Maybe we don't recognize it every time, but we understand that it happens. 
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was.

Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat. 
And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted, because they trust that the election system works. 
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. 
The thing is, if we don't know whether we are doing any good, we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches. 
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.

It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people. 
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest. 
You know, getting kids used to different realities, I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions, just to make a mental flexibility, give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. 
One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served -- small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon. 
It's not nice for our children to study with their children. 
There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry.

This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane. 
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book. 
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein, who, I believe, has paid his dues. 
And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness, as opposed to looking at it from the outside, fear subsides.

Two great examples are drugs, Prozac and Wellbutrin. 
This is a term by Steve Benner. 
So as a patriot, I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. 
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know; in fact, I think we know so much, and it's such a reality that we care so deeply, that in fact, what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up, because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives.

So what if I click this down to zero? 
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle. 
Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person, the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.

Hold her now with you. 
Shame. 
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task, but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that I think, if we understand, we can really move forward. 
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. 
Wow, you guys are great. 
And over the course of dinner, I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue -- it's a very poor country -- but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters, because Kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself. 
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand.

And then you can see people celebrating the next day. 
Now, TED is just a small part of this. 
The bathrooms and kitchens will, of course, have no windows.

Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on, and count how many symmetries there are. 
(Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right. 
And that's why we're last, because we don't value play. 
And a year after that, we did conquer it. 
But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal, there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have. 
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan. 
And this is a question, I think, which needs to be discussed carefully. 
And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. 
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world. 
I would have died in a day, but he was born there, and he understood how to survive. 
Now, it's been one of those dreams that's always seemed about 20 years in the future. 
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. 
You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around. 
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. 
I think it's important. 
So let me, from my personal experiences, give you an insight, so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley. 
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life. 
What worked well this week? 
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000. 
They are free from all of these modern ailments. 
If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered. 
There's a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation. 
It was advocating friends and a doting sister. 
There was sort of a movie made about it recently. 
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. 
But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. 
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. 
The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today, than ever in the past, because of what I'm talking about. 
So if all human life depends on plants, doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them? 
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. 
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No. 
The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today. 
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. 
The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever. 
If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent. 
It would mean that, even before birth, mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there, telling them, "Be careful." 
I take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself." 
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. 
And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp. 
It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com, and it's very important to listen to our voice. 
We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins. 
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal -- is that most of you are xenophiles, whether or not you use that term. 
Useless. 
But it's something that is very precise stuff. 
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. 
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. 
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid. 
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands, and so for him, Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement. 
So what you do -- you shut up. 
That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. 
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready. 
The reason this is happening boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem, which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. 
Now what are the implications of that? 
Maybe it's what the CIA's supposed to do for us. 
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything." 
Imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery, imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. 
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. 
And people always say, "Why do that? 
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work, that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed, or the degree of force that's applied. 
And so, at that time, I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues. 
And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time. 
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective, but also beware of the power of circles." 
The city came down on me, and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden, which this citation was turning into a warrant. 
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. 
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan. 
That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound, and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains. 
Data: Pretty lucky for them. 
So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us, go for it. 
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. 
It's a pretty expensive machine. 
Look at the sky. 
♪ True colors ♪ ♪ True colors are beautiful ♪ ♪ Like a rainbow ♪ (Applause) The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. 
Of course, after the event one can be wise. 
They can follow this expedition. I've started a program -- where are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, so that we can use exploration, and the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for. 
So I propose we have a Trump number, and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain. 
The existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation's development of cultural identity is very important. 
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is. 
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa. 
And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture, then we have a choice. 
A wise person knows when to improvise. 
There are many differences among the arts, but there are also universal, cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. 
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. 
And there's much more solar than there is wind. 
In the words of President Obama, "If the Taliban take over again, they will invite back Al-Qaeda, who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can." 
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic. 
When I was there three years ago, the windows were broken and the walls were peeling, but everything was left there as it was. 
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. 
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see, and the guy has to feed his family, right? 
So here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road, and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist, and up in the distance, if you look really closely, you can see some cones. 
It does something intrinsic to the act. 
India. Indus. 
So how do you move these people around? 
What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe," and climb into the back, and something ugly will happen. 
And remember, it's frozen. 
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall, and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students, and I'd like to try to preach it to you. 
But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines. 
And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. 
But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent. 
It's not clear what the target should be. 
Not as many votes. 
It's not geography. 
Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. 
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is, and it's been really, really hard. 
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field. 
It is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised. 
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. 
Because the last 20 years, the Somali woman has stood up. 
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. 
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. 
But the visual complexity is still very high. 
He was a very good golfer, but he had a disability. 
He said GDP "measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile." 
(Applause) Which brings me to the second paradox: sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. 
He has to keep his job. 
Well, this is actually four rappers' brains. 
And this is what we're doing when we make health care better. 
So we'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man, and that is authority. 
We're harnessing energy from the sun. 
No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm, but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels. 
My colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake, family doctors, businesspeople, professors, distinguished economists, historians, writers, army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors. 
And I, for one, refuse to live that way. 
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. 
(Applause) As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level. 
And the question is: Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening? 
That's cellulosic, second generation biofuels from prairie grass. 
How should we really honor Feynman? 
I want to thank her too. 
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen. 
And yet, in the controls there were three. 
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool. 
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace? 
So again, we got the short end of the deal there. 
Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us. 
The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000. 
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. 
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers. 
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon, which has just accelerated this huge shift, which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. 
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine, (Laughter) and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast -- (Laughter) -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- (Laughter) and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur. 
Naturally, I did not come out of the closet. 
They were saying they would stop. 
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them. 
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels. 
Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost. 
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. 
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness. 
Okay? We're feeding seniors. 
You might have a guess. 
Ten percent's come from India. 
I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years. 
For violin, you could get lessons for a violin. 
You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want, or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. 
It's been really important to make it comfortable. 
On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical. 
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds. 
And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish. 
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that? 
They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs. 
Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by. 
Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. 
(Applause) My students often ask me, "What is sociology?" 
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create, like Jennifer did in her improvisation, a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy -- he enters that different reality. 
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation in freefall also, with the helmet cam to film this jump. 
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson. 
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James. 
You just have to believe me, it is, it is. 
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. 
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear. 
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio. 
I'm watching your faces very carefully. 
It was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss. 
It would help to have a manual. 
But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving? 
Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons. 
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee, and it had broken like this. 
And there's a volcano behind, which has glaciers at the very top. 
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet, has given me perspective, and my hurt, my hurt has forced me to have hope, have hope and to have faith, faith in myself, faith in others, faith that it can get better, that we can change this, that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance, fight back against intolerance, and more than anything, learn to love ourselves, learn to accept ourselves for who we are, the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be. 
I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art, science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on. 
The Third World is connected, we are connected. 
Why? Because they have the data. 
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. 
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened? 
So where we used to think of heart disease as being a man's problem primarily -- which that was never true, but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s, and it was in all the textbooks. 
But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this. 
Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country. 
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle: People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts. 
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation. 
Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning, then there is another 40 years that's really reserved for working. 
At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian. 
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. 
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. 
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters except every thing and except matter. 
It could share information looking down at a screen. 
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. 
They were holding something like 700 people hostage. 
And now, here comes the other pirate. 
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons. 
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. 
Often they travel on pre-published routes. 
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things, you know, that Bill Gates talked about this morning. 
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot. 
And when the little girl came out of her scan, she ran up to her mother and said, "Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?" 
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on. 
So is that wrong? 
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. 
You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another, and they support weight. 
(Barking) Dogs. 
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?" 
After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. 
I focused on my mudras, on the imagery of my dance, on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself. 
So during the summer with my students, we built over 50 units of the shelters. 
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on. 
A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however romantic, is also instructive. 
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. 
But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves." 
Thank you very much. 
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem? 
Dry. 
Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort, and I didn't really know what to tell her, because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. 
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. 
(Music) Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you: Who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network? 
And as you go up, those are the bigger trials, so they've got less error in them. 
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. 
When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to 1.5 percent, then per capita income is doubling every nine years. 
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google. 
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves. 
It is lifeless. 
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. 
And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge. 
It's a labor of love for us and our small team, and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe. 
All right, we have a good division of opinion here. 
It was a little over 100 years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. 
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. 
And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. 
And you can see, he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. 
And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right? 
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends. 
Very few cities fail. 
In other words, race has no basis in biological or scientific fact. 
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. 
Anywhere he went, things went well. 
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant. 
Why do we show our emotions? 
So we are starting to get a handle on this, but only just the beginnings. 
It's actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds. 
All countries spy. 
Let me start by telling you a little story. 
What we're left with is a collection of five million books, 500 billion words, a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which, when written out, would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over -- a veritable shard of our cultural genome. 
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. 
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom. 
Right there, above, way above the solar system, way beyond our solar system. 
And of course, it turns into a circle. 
You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home. 
And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. 
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater, I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back. 
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant. 
And I think that that is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off. 
And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target? 
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. 
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future, hazily, but you can look into the future. 
These projects took thousands of actions in one year, making hundreds of thousands of people participating, creating millions of views. 
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks, knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. 
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. 
Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had. 
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous? 
So what I think I can do today, that best thing I can give you -- I've given you my story, which is the best I can do. 
When I was in grade two, I won a city-wide speaking competition, but nobody had ever said, "Hey, this kid's a good speaker. 
First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule. 
It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us. 
One group of people said you can distill your information, you can extract value, separate it and serve it up, while another group turned around and said no, no you can ferment it. 
There was just no future. 
We brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later, we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on at the moment so I have to be a bit careful, but I'm fairly confident. 
But -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio. 
Fast-forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors. 
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. 
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing. 
(Laughter) The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen. 
You have lights in an aircraft. 
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. 
♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫ ♫ little difference, yeah. ♫ ♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫ ♫ Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫ ♫ oh yeah. ♫ (Applause) Thank you so much. 
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders, which is a substantial portion. 
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix. 
They didn't teach it before then. 
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor. 
We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward. 
And here's the summary of what I'm saying. 
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough. 
So think about a cop. 
And partly this is already happening. 
And for the next 38 years, that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. 
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. 
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle? 
And nobody read it except for my mom. 
So this triptych, these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. 
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany. 
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick. 
He said, "It's absolutely possible." 
The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad, had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated, almost random, really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself, but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation, certainly for the first responders, and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology, or in terms of alphabetical, but through what's called meaningful adjacency. 
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions. 
It has not been seen publicly. 
A few hours later, it had gone up to 23.6 million dollars, plus shipping and handling. 
And for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. 
You can see there's some signals there. 
So let's think about the atoms. 
It just seemed that it was possible. 
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations. 
But this was transformative. Really transformative. 
There you go. That's connection. 
By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field -- in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030. 
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways; they're trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you'll be watching TV. 
My works also turned autobiographical. 
"Oh, all right." 
There's more social mobility. 
This is some mathematicians at MIT. 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. 
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers, and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers. 
So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market. 
(Laughter) So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. 
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead. 
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. 
There are starfish that can make light. 
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course. 
But they're getting very, very cheap, and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper, the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share, and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them. 
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers? 
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?" 
Well, if you are a liberal, you say, "Hey, that's great!" 
I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads," and I listed these lessons, a few of which you've heard here today: Approach the cow, pack your flipflops, don't see the wall, live the questions, harvest miracles. 
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. 
This is also, if you talk to legal scholars, the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. 
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me." 
For the sake of our health, our wealth and our collective security, it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on. 
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears. 
(Applause) I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one. 
We sang, we sang, we sang, and amazingly new trust grew, and indeed friendship blossomed. 
Now, each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. 
I'm sitting on a train. 
It's a plastic bag. 
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic, and, of course, my toaster had to have a plastic case. 
But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the "I Can" bug. 
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. 
So I put low-density liquid metal at the top, put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom, and molten salt in between. 
The rest will grow older and get two billion children. 
(Laughter) Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus. 
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself, you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time. 
We've been fooled by our tool. 
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. 
Look -- even if we look in Africa -- these are the African countries. 
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc. 
I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres, potentially, of plastic in five major oceans in the world. 
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop. 
About a year after 9/11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. 
But then you get the smart, geeky kids that have a touch of autism, and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things. 
Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying, "Well hey, there might be some problems" -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on. 
(Applause) Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals. 
And I've heard this story a number of times. 
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today? 
In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks, that damaged its communication and banking systems. 
In Motihari in Champaran, there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea. 
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. 
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget? 
I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small, down around 10 to 125 megawatts. 
But let me tell you a bit about it today. 
We need someone to come and study it. 
So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. 
(Laughter) So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door. 
Or the other way, and that's a false sense of insecurity. 
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video. 
It's what I study. It's what I treat. 
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. 
Are you ready? 
Is Edinburgh a horse? 
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season, and if it doesn't, the grassland and the soil begin to die. 
(Laughter) It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are. 
When composers write music for me, I ask them to forget what they know about the cello. 
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is. 
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else. 
Now the problem with this model of censorship, of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system, is that it won't work. 
And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws, and that different, better ones could be built. 
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. 
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk. 
Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound. 
She'd come every two months to visit me, and then I said I'm the man, I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate. 
Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true, things like the standard model of physics: what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. 
And Moi is 35 years old. 
But something much, much more powerful is happening now. 
So here, and at a time when we've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity, I urge you to do something. 
Would you like to see destruction? 
And here's an example from Thailand where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much -- it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured -- compared to its value as a shrimp farm, which is more like $9,600, there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. 
This is an ocean planet. 
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. 
(Laughter) So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's -- (Laughter) -- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. 
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars," which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. 
So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly talented TED community. 
And then the polishers come. 
We've heard all about this here this week, so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. 
Redemption, smoke. 
And everywhere, were symbols of the Chinese -- everywhere, a constant reminder. 
It's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious. 
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen. 
Six is two times three, 15 is three times five, 40 is five times eight, two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate? 
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before: FIFA, vuvuzela, weird jokes about octopi. 
They can be with words or without words. 
You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. 
And just very quickly, something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. 
And the same idea now can be built up. 
Me only existed in the trying. 
We made a number of discoveries. 
This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ. 
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs. 
But he was right, it was a stupid idea. 
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. 
So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. 
Well, to find out, our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. 
So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. 
People are going to be hurt. 
These are from remote control airplanes. 
In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. 
It's just two drops, like that. 
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition. 
This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system. 
Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right, the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times, and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early 1900s through now. 
So here are some other questions. 
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. 
That's what they thought they had built it for. 
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly, who actually resented this intrusion. 
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary, and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall, and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside, where they can't see and sense. 
All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door. 
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. 
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear. 
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel. 
They are new but trying to look old. 
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked. 
And I've done this in three parts. 
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right. 
And the dragons that arose are still among us today. 
China is soon to pass the U.S. 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set. 
You could use it in an industrial context. 
So we should get started now. 
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker. 
Which he did -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea. 
At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers. 
And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference. 
This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston. 
When we were ancient man — (Laughter) — millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) — we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed, we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel, and we'd go back to normal. Okay. 
And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions. 
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago. 
They're not doing 26 miles; they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time, and apparently without injury, without problems. 
(Applause) Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. 
I started examining my city, its culture, its infrastructure, trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. 
But here's a case which is harder to reject. 
And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. 
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before. 
And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice. 
And we sat here and we looked at these two problems, and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems. 
They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. 
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia. 
What do you say? 
(Applause) So, people of the TED community, I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. 
(Laughter) So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this? 
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. 
Not even worth it. 
By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome, people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future. 
And this is what it is. 
So the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks. 
After a pause, the waiter said, "One does not put sugar in green tea." 
There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030. 
So you see the style is different. 
And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource, it's really from knowledge. 
Instead, we spend our time talking. 
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music -- in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy. 
And the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable. 
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. 
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. 
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. 
Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. 
But we don't see it on social media, right? 
The halteres are actually gyroscopes. 
No machines have been developed. 
That's between, say at an average use, that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that. 
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you. 
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this? 
But to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see. 
But you'll notice something else, and that's that the face of the Sun has freckles. 
The year is 1963. 
So, here we got the white area in the middle, and you can pick it up. 
But even this is not a fair representation of Africa, because it's an average, it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. 
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. 
And I like to immerse myself in my topics. 
It's not quite finished yet. 
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species. 
And this kind of a world, this vast flying beast you can ride around, shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. 
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. 
It included an exterior loading dock. 
There she is. 
More women's voices at the table? 
So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period. 
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. 
The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another. 
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. 
Since then our aid has halved. 
And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago. 
In bigger systems, the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases. 
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house, and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when. 
He said, "Dave, I pulled up the X-ray image on the screen on the computer at home." 
So what started out as an idea, is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens. 
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time. 
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years. 
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. 
However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean, it couldn't be that difficult. 
This is what runs everything around us. 
So he said, "Okay, I get the point." 
It has an intact Hindu culture. 
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn, and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified. 
I like things that are weird. I like weird things. 
That was the real surprise of Bilbao. 
Now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they're built in a factory. 
And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century. 
Shellfish, mussels, oysters, clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species. 
Home and community are forces that rival even radiation. 
There's what we call atavism activation. 
There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat. 
And then, finally, that is our network. 
Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. 
But her suffering is equal to mine. 
How did they treat my parents? 
In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali, American and French parents were interviewed. 
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like. 
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees, which we know is really linked to creativity, which is linked to innovation, and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. 
So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. 
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting? 
And although these walls look very different, Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same. 
I saw people struggling to get by, not knowing what was what and what was next. 
There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things. 
For example: mental arithmetic. 
It's used to change the scene. 
EB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. 
They're excitatory. 
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. 
But Julián Le Barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year. 
She kind of set us up. 
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep. 
And we should save trees in the end. 
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception? 
May not seem that large -- let's get closer. 
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is. 
(Applause) For me, the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. 
(Laughter) The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos, 17 percent of us regret getting them. 
And over time, essentially what have I been doing? 
So their influence isn't that great. 
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long, flat tail. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
All the time we are trying to get value for money. 
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind. 
At night, I would sit with my family around the snowy, bunny-eared TV, and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. 
You have to make it from something else. 
So littleBits is open-source. 
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors. 
Now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry, it's helpful to work on what we biologists call "model organisms," animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice, in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons, as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning. 
The Paige typesetter had 18,000 parts. 
This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. 
I sat him down, I caricatured him, and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. 
So this problem is absolutely soluble. 
The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly, and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. 
I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they! 
If you're sitting in Japan, or in New Delhi, or in Hanoi, your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. 
I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides. 
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days, I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. 
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. 
In development, the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. 
But the gene that regulates that down is broken. 
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much, I thought, "I'll go out for a run." 
And third, you need desire. 
So I imagine my life: if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal, and they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here. 
And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger. 
With these words, thank you very much. 
And so we can feel unfinished. 
Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared. 
The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water, but rather salt that's melted. 
And I still worked as a tour leader, traveled back and forth in China, Tibet and Central Asia. 
The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand. 
The experiments that were going on were very simple. 
So we've created something called the collective brain. 
The fruits of their labors would afford them a home, for many the first piece of property that they would ever know, and a community with other first-time African-American home buyers. 
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world. 
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment, including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. 
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. 
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. 
This is real, genuine leather, without the animal sacrifice. 
And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly, fragile, obviously in the latter phase of active dying. 
Bambi: Yippee! 
They stopped us from being inspired. 
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. 
Shut it down at once." 
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam, aka JiLsi -- founder of DarkMarket, born in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination." 
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet. 
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before, which happens right here. 
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" 
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs, and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation, it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor. 
You'll all stay with me. 
At the beginning, it was a disaster. 
But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. 
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was. 
Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value. 
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. 
Last in Europe GDP per capita. 
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. 
Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome. 
But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them. 
I don't know how you feel, but I like to cook for entertainment. 
A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. 
And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. 
They look really good, very nice movement, and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other, similar to what we've seen before -- but again, working with just primordial conditions, no pure chemicals. 
Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) I started with paragliding. 
And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. 
And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements -- three-, four, five-thousand years old. 
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me, "Listen, I am breathing freedom. 
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone. 
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear]. 
Ghana got very ahead, fast. 
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment. 
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls. 
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. 
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist, as I still do -- asked a really strange question. 
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine." 
My body was often in the way. 
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies. 
Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers. 
And this cumulative cultural adaptation, as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas, is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives. 
It's a crap system. 
I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat. 
And it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings and gadgets and gauges. 
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. 
Sitting down is his brother Amjad. 
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. 
Building this system will also require a considerable investment. 
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet, I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level. 
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort. 
"Police chief fires Taser into 14 year-old girl's head." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to? 
That is our river. 
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance, because it's considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning. 
The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off. 
And seeing this reinforces, for me, that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them. 
It's amazing that these cells beat at all. 
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself. 
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race of the candidate a factor? 
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. 
To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. 
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size. 
So a crystal that will ring if that happens. 
No hacker can break in and change your vote, because then it won't match your receipt. 
There is an economy of scale. 
Well, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. 
And we're good at it. 
They have asked themselves, "What if, every time I started to invent something, I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'" And here is what they're learning. 
And they are interdependent over a long term. 
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. 
And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities, actually, beyond they don't have sex with other people. 
There's going to be a lot of people. 
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. 
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture. 
CA: And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening. 
So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something, or platforms. 
(Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. 
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. 
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. 
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. 
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. 
The same child that is not immunized against measles, if they do get measles, parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them. 
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly. 
My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. 
That is not just poetry. 
The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent. 
They know nothing about Wikipedia. 
And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. 
They don't like fighting over oil, they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates. 
Not enough examples. 
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. 
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno, who's the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo. 
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know." 
(Laughter) You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands, so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government, the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. 
You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine, but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for, you know, amusement parks and that kind of stuff. 
This is based on ranges from data, but if you look at nuclear, it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. 
You're all economists, and I think, like most economists, wrong. 
But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then. 
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. 
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. 
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? 
You have to be kind of smart, and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid, because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today. 
I know a woman who's good at this. 
Indeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy. 
You don't need everyone. 
You can do all those fun things. 
On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities, showing that increase. 
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees. 
"What's the story." 
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information? 
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say. 
And as a result, people tend to spread out. 
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand. 
So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism. 
The reason there is a billion-year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics, The crust of the Earth has been recycled. 
We all know Mubarak is technically dead. 
Just get whatever anybody wants." 
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. 
I still haven't given up my hope to see you. 
And so to me, this beautiful culture, this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games. 
And I want to be very clear. 
But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. 
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer. 
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes." 
Or I'll come to them and say, "Here's what I need done." 
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible? 
It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. 
We can reconcile. 
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard. 
How about living longer with good health? 
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents, I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone, which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital, but I was just looking for some sort of scribble, some unkempt cursive from my mother. 
I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer, and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers. 
This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time. 
Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. 
We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. 
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics. 
(Laughter) "And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head." 
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. 
Life hadn't changed for centuries. 
And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product. 
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough. 
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles. 
So now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers, satellites, ultralights. 
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home, compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box? 
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison. 
All the points, all the lines -- it's incredible. 
But interestingly, Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. 
That we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative, and we could take them through a series of steps, kind of like a series of small successes, and they turn fear into familiarity, and they surprise themselves. 
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. 
But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, "You're wrong, and I'm right." 
My father is here in the room today. 
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere. 
it's good for a nice suntan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body. 
My mother asked us to feel her hand. 
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen. 
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up. 
So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like. 
You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking, and in the way that you do, you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. 
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek, which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang, with other inmates and hit his head against the wall, which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers. 
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal. 
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road, feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts, feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. 
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains, Middle East, North Africa, Russia. 
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. 
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies. 
And then came the next stage of the equation. 
Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Archaea and, eventually, eukaryotes. 
And we have to get our messaging in there. 
But that's because all the young people left. 
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. 
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. 
I want to start with these word pairs here. 
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs. 
So we know, for example, that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers than one sugar pill. 
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. 
(Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. 
MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie. 
(Laughter) So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator, and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in. 
You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to. 
So how can this be? 
I woke up in intensive care, and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage I had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes, and I thought, "Great, because I'm going to the Olympics!" 
And perhaps a green roof in the future, when we're further utilizing urban areas, where there are stacks of garden spaces. 
Why or why not? 
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. 
Protect your ears in that way. 
And so I hope that maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. 
All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage. 
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor? 
So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually looks something like this. 
And the object itself invited exploration interaction, consideration and touch. 
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. 
I had a really hard time in school. 
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device so I can measure your grip strength? 
We call it the electronic jellyfish. 
It's a female now. 
And this is in Takaungu -- we've got a generator and a digital projector, and we're projecting it up against a barn, and showing one of the movies that they made. 
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. 
"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes I gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?" 
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. 
The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room. 
What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did. 
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear]. 
(Laughter) I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely. 
What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. 
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten. 
So the question is, why not eat insects? 
It was really a fascinating journey. 
YNH: Thanks! 
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97. 
And the answer is: not yet, they're working. 
Student: There's two up there. 
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water. 
So what needs to be done? 
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack. 
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked. 
If you enroll in private high school tutoring, go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. 
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. 
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the South Side of Chicago. 
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. 
Would it give this block of limestone new properties? 
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen?" 
Or, I should say, the students succeeded. 
Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. 
(Music) (Applause) Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free. 
And they're different. 
And I'll just read one. 
And of course, the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina. 
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that." 
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. 
The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996 and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave. 
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. 
We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study, and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. 
Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. 
So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test. 
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. 
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities. 
Infrared -- due to eye safety regulations, can be only used with low power. 
That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible. 
And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say, "I like sleeping. 
But before I left the hospital, the head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready, because when you get home, something's going to happen." 
I think we're doing it right now, but we're doing it unconsciously. 
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed. (Laughter) I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right? 
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same, even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. 
Wonderful human being, but he stills sells, at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood, because we haven't been able to convince the water park people, the lake people, in [unclear] operations. 
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global plutocracy, what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it. 
And I do it not just because it's fun -- though actually, it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives -- for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health. 
And he said, "Well, I've no idea. 
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. 
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys. 
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt. 
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition. 
Thank you very much. 
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. 
Do people have grid cells? 
No more little Knicks and little Nets. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) I'd like to speak about technology trends, which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow, for related reasons. 
Now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this: to keep our education system globalized, to keep our education system open to students from all over the world, because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles. 
You act compassionately. 
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. 
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India. 
So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face. 
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends. 
We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence. 
Many people helped me along the way to get here. 
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. 
Let me wrap with two key messages. 
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star, and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion. 
Now they don't know what they want to do with it, but they're going to figure it out. 
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. 
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College. 
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion. 
Looks absolutely ridiculous. 
So I grew up hating lions so much. 
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right and what can I learn from them to make my family happier? 
The World Health Organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. 
In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine. 
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf. 
I said, "Well, do it." 
And there's a lot of information. 
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.' I say, 'Let's do this.'" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop. 
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground? 
Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here. 
These effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. 
You probably think about a city full of energy, a vibrant city full of green. 
Number one is, they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. 
I have a better mousetrap. 
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich. 
They took off and hid in this labyrinthine, networking, spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons, and there they remained since the 1600s -- essentially the same way they've always been. 
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. 
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea, but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her. 
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question. 
These little girls turned to him and said, "We will vote you out of office." 
What a crime. What a crime. 
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here. 
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. 
And it's like the traffic that you see. 
You have to choose to believe in hope. 
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school, that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing, that it was not a good thing. 
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. 
When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person. 
Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son. 
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. 
And you can see, the world is crazily green. 
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here. 
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope. 
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists, but the truth is, of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions, I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed. 
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. 
When you share them, you end up using less. 
Now I am swimming in it. 
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square, and people had tried for years to make changes. 
But that's not actually what's happening right now. 
So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. 
And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. 
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too. 
So what happened on this day? 
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it. 
First of all, there's the object in the world. 
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent." 
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her, one third of them women, who have left their villages to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities. 
So I can see everything that Romo sees, and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world. 
I never forget my first multicultural reading, in Harvard Square about 10 years ago. 
Live life. Thank you. 
And the temporary materials are an important part of the program, because we were able to show how it worked. 
And same with the other cars. 
What the hell does that mean? 
In this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods, we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street, and the cars still in the mud. 
This wasn't supposed to happen. 
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos. 
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it. 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the human genome. 
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very, very well studied. 
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better... 
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. 
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s. 
Our idea for the bid was 100 percent solar cooling, based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia, we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems. 
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute; they just stuck there forever. 
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five. 
Well guess what? It didn't. 
Thank you very much. 
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail." 
And if you have lived an extraordinary life, you will be welcomed to Elysium, or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" -- (Laughter) -- the heaven of the heroes. 
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. 
And we did. We got better material. 
And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. 
This is his sister. 
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies, we deny death, poison the living and further harm the environment. 
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. 
(Laughter) And at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths. 
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. 
That's how physics works: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. 
In November of 2003, I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HIV/AIDS foundation. 
But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal. 
With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can carry pollen with them, very light pollen, and it's just a big supermarket in the city. 
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone. 
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence. 
If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole, this will create a cultural shift in the world, and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan. 
Would you get a divorce? 
This must be a guy who blushes all the time. 
Emmanuel: ♫ Top of the beat with no repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme make me complete ♫ ♫ Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed ♫ CL: Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain? 
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. 
I said, "Well, let's try it. 
And, in fact, I started painting on anything, and started sending them around town. 
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And here's how it works. 
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. 
Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart. 
And they really, really do. 
So I had 50 overall summaries done. 
And so, they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible. 
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry, but they could also be using biology. 
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self-expression, self-exploration, questioning, creativity and play. 
But, of equal importance, as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars, we transmit that journey, the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth, we transmit those images back to Earth. 
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill. 
The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us. 
It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type -- including returning the type to its place, which was a very difficult thing. 
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret, which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time, that we should always look forward and not backward, and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets. 
My mother became a diplomat. 
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. 
What they care about is the robot. 
And that goes into the story, too. 
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen. 
That's what I would love to do. 
You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous. 
We reconditioned them all, fixed them. 
You get something that goes much deeper than that. 
And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve, and why did it evolve only in our species? 
But a lot of people don't love it so much. 
What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. 
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious. 
They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. 
One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. 
And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker. 
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one. 
There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11. 
After high school, I left home to study and learn more about the world. 
In 1979, I witnessed my first military coup. 
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. 
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said, "When you let go of what you are, you become what you might be." 
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you. 
So I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right? 
Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder, which is sugar. 
They have urban streetscapes, but suburban parking ratios. 
And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was, there was a famous case in 1944 where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany. 
And we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence, as we get closer and closer to this technology. 
You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought, and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity. 
This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain. 
It's got, by now, pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library. 
These changes are coming. 
It's the greenest building in the world. 
The complexity here is unbelievable. 
It might give them pause. 
Space may be finite or infinite, but because the universe is accelerating, there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. 
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this. 
He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions, and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying, which he patented in the late 1930s -- and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in 1960. 
So this woman, this boy's mother installed this latrine in a few hours. 
They really loved it. 
The observation that stem cells, as master cells, could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells, liver cells, pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. 
And here she has our damned data -- it's a pun -- which is starting to break out, starting to break through -- the water symbolizes our data. 
You go again and again and again. 
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating. 
How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube? 
Or we could use it as research plots, where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils, or we could use it to generate energy. 
We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist. 
(Laughter) Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example, which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status of families living in, for example, rural Nigeria. 
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes, "You see this bar? 
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. 
(Music) Speaking of the environmental crisis, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out. 
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. 
Well I believe they're getting left far behind. 
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing. 
And one of the most tedious ones, I think, was saying that beauty was about symmetry. 
But occasionally we miss something. 
Now if you ascribe to the God complex, what you do is you find yourself a little God. 
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this. 
As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism. 
Over the course of human history, starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. 
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. 
Even this problem, too complicated. 
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things? 
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates, but also including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. 
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability. 
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere. 
This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. 
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes. 
It topped 400 psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere. 
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. 
Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously. 
Thank you. 
It's full of history, and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war. 
So for instance, several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. 
If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. 
Every species does it. 
It's got germ. Those are the good things, but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat. 
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" -- and there's 12 seconds left on the clock -- "we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together. 
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in. 
But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive, then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers. 
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. 
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest. 
I was able to leave, because of one final, sadistic beating that broke through my denial. 
We know that. 
(Music) Was that nice? 
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice." 
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students. 
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream. 
Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people. 
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected. 
Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids, another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book. 
They took out two of my broken ribs, and they rebuilt my back, L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib, they fused T12, L1 and L2 together. 
Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags, maybe a small space, a hotel room. 
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did. 
In fact, [unclear] still says this today. 
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated. 
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. 
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep. 
I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. 
It should be opinion-driven; less news, more views. 
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women. 
Why would we waste this money on you?" 
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. 
The world came. 
So this is what I looked like by the end. 
(Laughter) But you can do things like cups, for example, and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods. 
I was born and raised in North Korea. 
Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting. 
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. 
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. 
But one thing is clear. 
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously. 
But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. 
And if you can imagine this tiny area, it's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon. 
I went out and I worked at a non-profit, I went to grad school, I phone-banked, I protested, I volunteered, and none of it seemed to matter. 
And I learned these two facts, and I thought, what's going on in shipping? 
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. 
Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way, we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to 10 words. 
We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure. 
Miko: I don't think so. 
But robots are still not in our home, ironically. 
It looks like we're getting somewhere. 
So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. 
Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. 
If we're not processing life, we're not living it. 
We insist on faith in the future and in each other. 
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are. 
And of course, you're responding with all of these. 
And after about six weeks, I finished, painted, mounted my own dodo skeleton. 
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. 
It came from about 300 years ago, and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"] Imagine trying to run the show, trying to run the entire planet, without computers, without telephones, with data handwritten on pieces of paper, and traveling by ships. 
That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies, early on, and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background. 
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa. 
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. 
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years. 
Next to him is Dan Panosian, one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men. 
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. 
Let's go up to 2008. 
These are from the Daily Mail. Every country in the world has a newspaper like this. 
And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside, and make those compasses go crazy, always centering on them. 
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War, said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. 
What can we do? It's not so easy. 
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world, should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships. 
And this influenced me. 
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know. 
So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry, 'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'" And so on. You can go even further back than this. 
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education. 
(Applause) The stories we tell about each other matter very much. 
(Laughter) My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught-controlled application for almost a decade now. 
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. 
One of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate. 
And the link I clicked on here, well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. 
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things -- the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret, the more acute that regret will be. 
It's the power of patient networks. 
It's disheartening, it's sad. 
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up? 
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. 
And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump, and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. 
And this is what he got painted. 
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. 
And more importantly, you don't actually see what gets edited out. 
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image. 
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15, 2005, our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch, and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day. 
Now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca. 
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker, so I'm not in a rush." 
It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. 
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. 
If you look at online media consumption -- in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet -- more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. 
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles? 
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you. 
So the question is, why? 
And unfortunately, the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene -- of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like -- they typically use words like "discovered" or "caught" or "found out," as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed. 
And what I'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points. 
Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other, that deliver these services. 
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. 
There's a second reason I like these development goals, and that is because each and every one is measured. 
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test. 
I believe they've heard your talk. 
On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab. 
But I didn't start out obsessed with food. 
I was so happy. 
You'd be fed a simple audio clip. 
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. 
Communication technologies: 50 different ways to measure this, the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet. 
Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. 
This is what's going on in the games industry right now. 
Thank you very much. 
I'm going to be talking about this. 
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. 
That costs about 100 dollars. 
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying? 
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. 
Or the way that we attract sexual partners? 
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with? 
But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied. 
And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying, "Don't be an entrepreneurial type. 
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. 
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged. 
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water. 
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants. 
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them. 
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. 
You try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip, and the ones that win, that you can then put into a living organism. It'll work. 
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality. 
And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale. 
Could we have people singing together in real time? 
I got social interaction through shared interest. 
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches. 
Whereas if we made them heavy, they'd be both hostile and inefficient. 
Thank you. 
The story Americans tell, the story upon which the American dream depends, is the story of limitless choice. 
It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit. 
The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world. 
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there. 
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build. 
So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before. 
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. 
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured. 
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. 
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer. 
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress. 
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. 
We need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets I was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world. 
So, for example, stones. 
We need very large archives, and we need excellent specialists. 
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday, the phone rang in the penguin office. 
So we had to create one. 
Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are, I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. 
We know it all. 
This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China. 
What could the future of animal products look like? 
Because what we actually count truly counts. 
Now that could be a dog door, it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room. 
And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong. 
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey. 
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. 
And she became Dilma Rousseff, the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world -- moving from minister of energy to president. 
But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day, and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day, and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about 40 weeks. 
But on some trials, we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell. 
He said, "What is your father's name?" 
So I find myself asking: where is music in all of this? 
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it? 
We've got a lot to do, a lot to solve, also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement. 
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat. 
It's important to remember that we evolved. 
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample, and by the 25th of August, it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio. 
And I can try steering the car here by ... 
(Laughter) And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different. 
I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you." 
And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. 
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. 
It's getting them wrong that is living. 
A couple of weeks ago, I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. 
It's raining like crazy here. 
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today: following what happened to Neda, people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging, changing their address to Tehran, Iran, and making it difficult for the security services. 
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn. 
There were 56, and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits, he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81. 
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose, because at that time, the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red, which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes. 
I happened to be living in Springfield at the time, and the best part of it was -- is that -- you would close the women's door in the bathroom, and I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really? 
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate," and sort of think you're stuck there. 
I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation, the 16 ounces of puss, is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico, and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish. 
The handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid. 
And very often I've been an outsider. 
And that's the message I try to convey to them. 
And back in China, what do they say in China? 
I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body, so I learned how to do this. 
Food can be there and people can't buy it. 
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future, or the past. 
But the results were overwhelming. 
If we go beyond our solar system, we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. 
Yes, you know it. 
It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. 
That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region. 
So why is that? 
But I'd like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam, when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient, we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage, but we're losing much more than that. 
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA. 
Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out. 
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized. 
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. 
We know that people will work from wherever they want, whenever they want, in whatever way they want. 
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces, you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own. 
You must have all seen the Arab Spring, which began in Tunis and in Egypt. 
He came up with a name for his mystery agent. 
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. 
It's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow." 
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. 
(Applause) Space, we all know what it looks like. 
A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me." 
They were a highly intelligent species. 
If only there was a way to automate this." 
Now here's an interesting comparison. 
And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots. 
And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no. 
That is, you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size, how many branches of a given size does a tree have, how many leaves, what is the energy flowing through each branch, what is the size of the canopy, what is its growth, what is its mortality? 
It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time, which would be useful out in the lobby, I would say. 
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. 
Imagine it says TED, because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. 
Now, the academics in this audience may think, "Well, that sounds like plagiarism." 
Now I'm here with a genuine expert. 
After a while, his advisers complained. 
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits, we can have both. 
I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the 20th century, the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers, I'd like to call them all up here, and they're going to call back to you. 
The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. 
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. 
And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. 
He tasted it and fell in love with it. 
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back. 
This is how we see a rainforest, in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. 
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one. 
Behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated. 
But there was a big difference. 
But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains. 
We've mentioned the health, but it needs consumers to buy into it. 
Last July, in Science, the journal Science, 19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article. 
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets, we need to think about that. 
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in, turn on, drop out thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories. 
Homosexual necrophilia. 
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. 
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person. 
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio. 
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots" can be in the deep ocean, an area that has historically been seriously neglected, if not abused. 
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones. 
And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom. 
And often it does something more. 
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these. 
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. 
We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times. 
You probably won't. 
But it was a little bit boring. 
(Applause) Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row. 
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator. 
But in the long-term, both feeling and reality are important. 
And I quote, "As my muscles weakened, my writing became stronger. 
Everyone has done something. 
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear. 
Thus, even though every civilian killed, maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many, the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago, is good news. 
The planets which are marked "like Earth," [are] definitely more than any other planets that we see. 
Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill? 
(Audio) ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫ ♫ And things that looked so good yesterday ♫ ♫ are now shades of gray ♫ ♫ And it seems like the world is spinning ♫ ♫ while I'm standing still ♫ ♫ Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell ♫ ♫ And then you say ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ And now the words sing ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
I just become skanky. 
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at. 
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world. 
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days? 
So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain, has a region called the dendrites that receives input, and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron. 
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now, and that makes them even more difficult. 
I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. 
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists; they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice. 
And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. 
We've got to find ways to build up, as well. 
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. 
And we can use that same pulse, now applied to the RTPJ, to ask if we can change people's moral judgments. 
Now there is another side to this. 
It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd. 
It's an expression of love. It's an expression of — God, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought. 
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees, and you are to make it within that." 
Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. 
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. 
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us. 
I like it as a component of global change to talk about, because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic, and I talk to that community fairly often, you cannot deny the simple physics of CO2 dissolving in the ocean. 
In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. 
And then globalization is taking place. 
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-espressos. 
You're going to need caregivers. 
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. 
I also translate weather data into musical scores. 
And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth. 
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation, existed in the 12th century. 
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. 
Who studied some physics in university? 
And there is a slight downturn. 
And I don't mean chewing the crabs. 
(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047, and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89. 
Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, "Well I guess that was just a place for girls. 
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilliant, and we broke through. 
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading. 
We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble, and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models. 
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building. 
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. 
Our boys' deaths galvanize. 
(Laughter) Well, it seems to get the point across. 
They don't read music. 
The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret -- and the last question, what's next? As quickly as possible, if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail. 
And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. 
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars, but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000. 
Nothing need change." 
The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language. 
She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. 
But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. 
As I've researched what's going on in the United States, a few interesting little insights have come up. 
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years. 
So we have these feast and famine cycles. 
Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion. 
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this? 
And it all begins with curiosity. 
Where are the interior sound designers? 
And you actually don't have a lot of options. 
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich." 
Unfortunately, it turned out, that many of these trials were withheld. 
And so on. So I suddenly figured that, how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children? 
Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world. 
What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. 
It was truly exciting. 
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails, pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. 
And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0. 
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it. 
Architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these. 
And if you comply, you will go to heaven. 
That's bad, but there are places like that. 
Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated. 
Technology accelerates things exponentially. 
And they had a look at what was in the soup, and they found amino acids, but nothing came out, there was no cell. 
(Laughter) So there's a language of light in the deep ocean, and we're just beginning to understand it, and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. 
And as we thought about our goals -- I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution, in the classical sense that humanism, at its best, finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people. 
That's where those big peaks are over to the left. 
It's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. 
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. 
Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. 
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal. 
People would name the robots. 
So let your car gossip about you. 
You just go to the website, fill out the form, give them $60, and it arrives in the post. 
But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2.5 million people, and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. 
If, for example, terrorism almost never happens, it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures. 
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade. 
We know what they are. 
And we can use veterans to improve disaster response. 
(Music) This two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue, the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world. 
Because what can you do with that data? 
And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio. 
Going way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. 
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this. 
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." 
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. 
So you can take it off the wall. 
We accept payment for advertising, and we mark it as such. 
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work. 
And if we don't pay attention to it, it could be a real problem. 
And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters, these personalized filters, is that, because they're mainly looking at what you click on first, it can throw off that balance. 
Well, I really care about 1980 because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. 
They just make it [with] nuts or something. 
In the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution. 
(Laughter) There we go. 
Here we are not talking about a predator. 
In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. 
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either. 
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world. 
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living," but that's not right. 
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. 
So this happened in 1978, and I was teaching many years later, and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. 
(Laughter) And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it. 
And what I found was on other websites, even by the third page of Google results, "Outlook is bleak", "Prognosis is grim." 
And news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer. 
But let me start with a Viking photograph. 
In that very short learning curve, you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record. 
(Laughter) I was sent to a place, a psych ward, and in the psych ward, everyone is doing their own one-man show. 
And it's when this lid goes on the part, that the magic really starts. 
The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most. 
Would it be crazy to know, 103 Gs. 
And radio waves are limited. 
Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. 
Actually, from the 19th century on, there's a whole revisionist, reformist -- whatever you call it -- tradition, a trend in Islamic thinking. 
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. 
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. 
Excuse that expression. 
So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special. 
People have murdered those that they loved, believing that they were murdering an imposter. 
But this story is far more interesting than that. 
What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. 
This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks. 
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. 
I love that word. 
It's the most inclusive approach you can take. 
Everything was going bad. 
We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game. 
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long. 
We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games. 
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising for -- ever since I left school, so about seven, eight years now, and it was draining. 
And we will not engage. We're not going to engage." 
Now, what do we do when we find a match? 
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. 
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul, with strong Turkish roots, but the other part travels the world, connecting to different cultures. 
And the day before the actual ceremony happens, we were dancing, having excitement, and through all the night we did not sleep. 
SW: Yeah. 
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more, but he has left behind a message. 
I work with a species called "Bonobo." 
We should, but it made exactly this point. 
Thank you. 
I'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News. 
And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him. 
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person. 
And over here there's a golf course going in. 
It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about. 
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them, and the numbers don't do it justice though. 
Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. 
At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was "art project." 
But until they have the same energy consumption per person, they shouldn't give advice to others -- what to do and what not to do. 
Let us all meet in that field. 
Would they yearn for my approval, my love, my voice? 
I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this. 
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level, all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes. 
It's gangs like -- let's go to GangstaBucks.com. 
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. 
And so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep, bleeps. 
This is one way to do it. 
Here, I'll give you an example. 
But you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way, using our senses, is quite recent. 
We become what we really are interested in. 
So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention, and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere -- but today, my case study is going to be Palestine. 
Second, economic growth. 
And secondly, it's a fundamental business proposition. 
So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. 
He's looking for those genes as well. 
This is of new infections. 
The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter) BR: But it's not all just edible pictures. 
It's actually in the key of B flat. 
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising? 
(Laughter) (Applause) What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening farmer's markets. 
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. 
This goes on for another four stops. 
But what will come in the future? 
Keep building them. 
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang; there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong, and there's also the kind, the generous. 
And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions, I believe, teaches us about democracy. 
It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really. 
Look at that. What are you feeling about it? 
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. 
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera. 
One, competition. 
Or you can do beautiful things that, if the camera can capture, you can make. 
Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth, or aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children, whilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others. 
For instance, a poet describes it in this form. 
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread, but now fiber on top of fiber. 
Military power is important. 
They need to tell me about my brand. 
Now you show me a successful complex system, and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error. 
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this. 
That'd be the second thing. 
We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics, and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees, and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it. 
And what do you do at the end of 10 days? 
In fact, most of us do, whether we're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter, what drives us is that, despite our doubts and even because of our doubts, we reject the nihilism of despair. 
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood. 
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues. 
And we might want to look at these various images. 
And Zuckerberg said, "A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa." 
Now most of the time, that works. 
The insides were Lego. 
Then you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly it's a different game. 
I was like, "Great." 
Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites, with specimens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours. 
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media, and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior. 
They have a pamphlet that says, "Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality," and you open it up, and there's nothing in it. 
How important is this? 
A parachute opens up to slow it down. 
One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast. 
384,000 women, American women, last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery. 
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons. 
And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone, Internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they're simple, the functions are simple, and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. 
We do not buy people out of slavery. 
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms. 
And when you put them together, something magical happens, something absolutely incredible happens, and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. 
So our dream is to bring teenagers together, so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience, as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure. 
In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise. 
It highlighted Toyota and Canon and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums. 
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. 
We're the new technologists. 
And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. 
Remarkably -- no, miraculously -- he lived. 
(Applause) We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it. 
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now. 
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond. 
That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better. 
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places. 
And you can see the cops in this footage right here. 
"Honor," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obey." 
The idea is very, very simple. 
Invite the crowd, let in the light, dial up the desire. 
I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for 13 consecutive assignments. 
It's about 30 degrees outside. 
And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. 
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. 
Found the protein collagen. 
And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. 
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man? 
It's that big. 
Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. 
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing. 
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me. 
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813." 
Ideas can spark a movement. 
What they have sweated so far has no meaning. 
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army. 
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government. 
Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs, to see what the difference was in people’s facility and speed with coming up with ideas. 
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species. 
You have to be able to navigate in 3D. 
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. 
We don't need to go to space to answer that question. 
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides. 
Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it. 
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. 
What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination. 
By seven months of gestation, the fetus' taste buds are fully developed, and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell, are functioning. 
And I love the idea of something hidden. 
Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri. 
What I will never have again, ever, is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. 
And we've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere. 
I've experienced it personally myself. 
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first? 
And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere, we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. 
40 billion of these things built. 
And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century. 
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. 
Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room, I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. 
And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery. 
And how do you secure their privacy? 
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant. 
And you can ask: What happens to these moments? 
Among the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation, for example, would be evidence of an impending epidemic. 
And in parting I said, "Is there anything I should do?" 
Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets. 
And what I do is I study insects. 
And secondly, to make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action, as we are doing. 
Thank you. 
If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. 
Ohhhhh, wowwww! 
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. 
Here in America, people actually love TV. 
It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle. 
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world, including its own, thanks to a combination of factors: its low costs, its large and educated workforce, and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands. 
So here's to another day at the office. 
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of. 
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay. 
And we're no exception, our generation. 
Because it’s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute. 
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. 
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it? 
So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super, hyper — (Laughter) (Applause) to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function. 
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide, and you've probably been asked to care about things like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles, but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together. 
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world, we call Vagina Warriors. 
He could not say no to anything, and that is why, that he cannot say no to things, we got this building today. 
(Applause) Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. 
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable, whether it might be amenable to life, we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is, but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation, the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation. 
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. 
And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes, so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air, they would waste more oil, and block the uptake of efficient, new planes. 
In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. 
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands. 
Many countries have not developed inclusive schools, and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school, at age six or seven. 
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens. 
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first massive, open, online courses, although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs. 
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable. 
This is my passport from 2004. 
We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. 
This is about one percent of the total population. 
Books banned in China, of course. 
And looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland. 
Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber. 
He just looked back at me very warmly, but said no words. 
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it, we have to engage at least two of those modalities, or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience. 
The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers, I should say people who write about science -- and editors would sit down over a couple of beers, after a hard day of work, and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works. 
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people -- I mean, not terrible in this -- but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with, from another university, another group, all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less. 
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known, I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats, and why not -- a toothbrush? 
They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it, and that they, Anonymous, are the authentic voice of resistance -- be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships, against global media corporations, or against intelligence agencies, or whoever it is. 
The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer." 
The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget. 
Step back, give your mother a break, okay. 
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. 
It was taking place inside the homes, mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. 
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. 
And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. 
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. 
Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54. 
Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. 
This is an example that you might care about someday, and I hope you never do, because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer. 
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart. 
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles. 
Good job. Good job. 
Chance favors the connected mind. 
You believe you're going to be successful in this project? 
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. 
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh. 
I started writing English questions on the blackboard. 
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce, you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised. 
Well, they didn't stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages. 
We're really good at small numbers. 
And I woke up from my visualization and I said, who was that? I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha, two very famous Indian actresses, like the Meryl Streeps of India. 
Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. 
Is it just a waste of whiskey? 
We have a whole range of challenges about this work. 
And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835. 
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty. 
She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. 
The next day I was in Tahrir. 
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense and still hold onto their cars, but the reality is that, by and large, what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect, where people simply stop driving as much, and increasingly, more and more people, if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home, give up their cars altogether. 
They see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from. 
Even then, unfortunately, it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually. 
For me, the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table, enunciated by another professor, Dimitri Mendeleyev. 
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her, and she taught me a heck of a lot. 
And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful. 
I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had 600 six-word summaries for those. 
Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars. 
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair, and he's showing his machine. 
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization. 
I liked the fine detail it gave my work, but I wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in. 
We're not going to meet targets, providing people with sanitation at this rate. 
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. 
So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu. 
And the nurses told me two things. 
First of all, we invented ways of recording -- first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well. 
It's coming from us. 
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat. 
And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. 
So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship. 
So very small, but very useful. 
But there's no major difference. 
And that source is design for generosity. 
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it." 
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? 
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. 
And I would say that we live in a country -- five percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners. 
Then we said, "Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?" 
So you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans, of insects, of fishes, of birds. 
And then in paintbrushes, hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature. 
(Applause) So, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk. 
Already in medicine, biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts, like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone, that have been successfully implanted into patients. 
So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow? 
This is an old study. 
Power is multi-polar. 
And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device. 
You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion. 
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. 
Now the students and I enjoyed the class, but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern, the teaching technology isn't. 
That's the question. 
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems. 
It used punch cards, which were being fed in, and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81. 
So I met this character, Steven. 
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel, and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with. 
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA. 
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump. 
It is our light, and not our darkness, that frightens us." 
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. 
The oil is not liquid. 
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love. 
And this means that these things do exist in our universe, and we have to contend with this, we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world. 
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world. 
It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?" 
Well because they don't know that it was different. 
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways. 
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head. 
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way," and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God," it is because they became so much an instrument of God, they became part of God's team -- so that God's will was manifest through them, and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. 
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative. 
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button. 
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders, even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. 
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff, and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department. 
And I went and had a look at some of the figures here. 
There's a point to be made here. 
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. 
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened. 
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere. 
So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports." 
But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. 
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. 
He keeps organizing. 
And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. 
It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in. 
Thank you. 
Not all of them, but some of them were, because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners, it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience. 
And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. 
And I'm on this. 
The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge. 
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 
It's called Be Here Now. 
Languages are genes talking, getting things that they want. 
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. 
This has got to go tomorrow. 
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. 
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question. 
Anyone? 
So when it was finally done, and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry, one of the neighbors called the police. 
This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon, this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery. 
How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee? 
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately. 
Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think. 
Six months later, the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice, and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it. 
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely, but for the sake of the oceans, we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions as soon as possible. 
But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. 
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. 
You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. 
They’re one of the first subsea aviators. 
Open knowledge, open aid, open governance, and together, they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. 
We have the zone with the sugar palms, and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart. 
It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language, which may further endear the baby to the mother, and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language. 
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content." 
(Laughter) In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two. 
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves, luckily, our courses were converging. 
All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening." 
And as I said, the trouble with this is that, in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. 
So if I want to see the back side, I can flip and see from behind. 
I know I can. 
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output, and what the implications of this are. 
But I know it when I see it." 
Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I decided to base our cathedral, so to speak, on the simplest possible building block, which is something called NAND. 
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else. 
And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service, his system was called NLS for oN-Line System. 
That is what economists do. 
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality, and yet, one can be able to fund them. 
Clean means follow their money. 
And again, we know from long-term monitoring that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent-raised chicks. 
You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best. 
They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another -- moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. 
Also it's bad news for us. 
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. 
[Clapping] And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land. 
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that. 
"Two boys hit me today in school. 
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness. 
It is happening all across the world, in every kind of walk of life, and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. 
If we manage to do that, forget the molecular detail. 
So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. 
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes. 
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else? 
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree. 
Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again. 
Some people will say it's for biometric security. 
And the only way you can solve these problems -- and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century -- is through cooperation, through working together, which means that soft power becomes more important, that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. 
We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it. 
Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. 
And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. 
because the clickity-clack of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away. 
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. 
Here in Galapagos, we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. 
Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. 
The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence, when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task -- when a craftsman feels lost in his craft, when a naturalist feels at one with nature, when a believer feels at one with God's love. 
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. 
But my problem was, I didn't have the money to pay for them. I couldn't afford them. 
There's something much deeper than that, but I can't think of another word for it. 
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources and the focus to it, what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery? 
They're always made from local chert. 
There's no kind of social protocol for this. 
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals. 
It was all the lies that got told before and after. 
So basically, they're learning how to build on good news. 
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
(Applause) Everyone needs a coach. 
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people. 
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness. 
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart? 
We are going to be okay. 
And in all these 42 cases, when we kept pushing them back, there was three kinds of reaction. 
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book like ammunition, and adding messages to them, and I started spraying them on the walls. 
They also live deep. 
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. 
It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. 
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree. 
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. 
You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again. 
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED. 
(Applause) So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. 
It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from, to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did. 
They're genocidal inmates, most of them, and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines, because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank, pretty much like a stomach, then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas, and you can cook with it. 
Because there is different types of design. 
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings. 
This was a tragedy, but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing. 
They all get $10 if they agree to show up. 
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then, even as I delivered it, and which I understand better now is this: I will always, always, always be there. 
(Applause) Someone who looks like me walks past you in the street. 
A story: I studied in India. 
Thank you. 
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets, it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies. 
So if we, for example, trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it, and then we follow where that comment goes, and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content, a very interesting structure becomes visible. 
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. 
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world. 
And so you're stuck on a bus. 
These 100-year-old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor, 30 or 40 times a day. 
And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them, and she's right. 
And to my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day. 
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. 
This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there. 
I'm doing something serious. 
GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities, not just whether they're well-run, and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three, of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one. 
And this is not an ability; it's a drive and a motivation. 
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism. 
Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities, fictional realities. 
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they're taking or taking too little risk, we need to think about that. 
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate, and if we coupled these now to inheritable information, we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve. 
They sometimes store grain in it. 
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. 
As a little boy, and through my teenage years, I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. 
I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods, Pads, and bling, which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death. 
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment. 
This is it. 
She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. 
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even. 
And that is how this difference has come. 
Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other. 
Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now -- bed bugs, killer bees, spam -- and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question. 
In the United States, for example, more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years. 
And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius, which means the higher the temperature you go to, thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies. 
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me, then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and, preferably, the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. 
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu. 
So if you're in drug discovery, for example, you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. 
And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate. 
Both my personal and my professional life changed. 
And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem: even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible," the "Waterman" blue ink. 
No one's noticed, have they yet? 
Are there moms who've raised boys around that table? 
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception, and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. 
By a rate of two to one, the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant. 
Organization helps, so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. 
It turns out we were wrong on that. 
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children. 
Cyclist: Who are you? 
She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America. 
Let's make it concrete. 
OK, so that's the healing one. 
In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about 15 meters per year, and nobody told me that. 
Oh, boy. 
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history. 
Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens, when the constituents are liberated, they disappear, they go away because they [were] absorbed. 
Let's take a look. 
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike. 
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it. 
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. 
And we started working on it, and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. 
I was literally pushed to school. 
This is affected massively by reverberation time, how reverberant a room is. 
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. 
Once we change those two things -- if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction, you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent, with what? 
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. 
And we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years, I've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions. 
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them. 
And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. 
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English. 
Are you a nice chimpanzee? 
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster, comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same. 
A bigger one for you to look at. 
The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. 
And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam. 
Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks, and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. 
And secondly, they are the smallest reality. 
It makes us a highly effective company. 
The last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family. 
Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar. 
Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways? 
We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn. 
I'm still breaking the silence today. 
The first questions is, how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests? 
And they're not necessarily, you know, great ways of looking at the entire world. 
And a lot of them are actually pretty good. 
JA: So this is the Kroll Report. 
We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. 
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims? 
See, I'm an artist. 
But I'm also a skeptic. 
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility. 
And that's not going to hurt. 
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks? 
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. 
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. 
(Applause) And in the first year, I had to fire half of the men. 
How lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together? 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
And really, that's what other organisms do as well. 
Or there may be another way of doing it, which is to think about the problem in terms of what -- if you associate with moral philosophers -- is called the teapot problem. 
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. 
So these are data from Scotland. 
Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries. 
One year ago to this very day, I woke up. 
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids. 
And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. 
Other conditions show people the future self. 
(Laughter) It's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out, "How do I find out if they have emotions or not?" 
Here's Andy's theory. 
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along, and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line. 
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. 
So what does this mean? 
Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths. 
She got her toilet, and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing. 
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face. 
She got into Women for Women International's program. 
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear -- which brings us to suit up. 
Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back; it's abetting a crime. 
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act. 
But before that, what actually happened was, I used to think about it as, you could take care of your health, or you could take care of obligations, and one always came at the cost of the other. 
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges, they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July, followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity. 
There will be radio telescopes, sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation. 
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.' If you make that an option rather than the default, you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking, and they do it three times as often." 
Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things, on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves, like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing. 
Because you know why they're here, and you know what they're doing here. 
So, we're making smart games for social media. 
We go into rural communities and all we do, like has been done in this room, is create the space. 
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. 
And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist. 
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion. 
You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like. 
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds. 
And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation. 
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community. 
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. 
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. 
Zappos isn't a shoe store. 
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. 
You can't use infrared in the sea. 
There is something different; you can click on it, and if you click on it, you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth. 
Well, we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. 
I was physically exhausted, mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure. 
Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends, and that creates a huge challenge. 
Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK, to figure out what that image will look like. 
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. 
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting. 
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you? 
So I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose. 
So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally, liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. 
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same. 
Not very long. OK. 
Why would you use this example of all examples?" 
And actually, about a year or so ago, there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu, where by looking at people's searching behavior today, we could know where the flu -- what the status of the epidemic was today, what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. 
Okay, we'll play it for you again now, and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D. 
We can say that. 
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it." 
They're not rich at all. 
Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter) This is not unlike the world of comedy. 
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves. 
And then what you can do is put that in space, because much of this information is spatial. 
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants, but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating. 
When this came out on television, the value of her art dropped to nothing. 
I used to be against nuclear power. 
So, what do you do? 
And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. 
My life was not going to be the same. 
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. 
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me. 
Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe? 
We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. 
And rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language. 
I experience exponentially. 
Now, conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them, and over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars. 
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. 
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue. 
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following. 
We stop for a drink of water. 
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game, EVE Online. 
(Laughter) So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. 
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms, within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. 
He was talking about strong, smart, hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. 
And, since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an 18 year-old with an AK-47, who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing, he can take a picture of it with his cellphone, send the picture back to where there is a doctor, and the doctor can look at it. 
But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14. 
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. 
The problem was just that in the material, mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.

And if Paula decides should she marry Joe or Jack, somehow Paul sounds the most interesting. 
So we are on the verge, 2015, of an amazing achievement, the schoolification of the world. 
Okay, let's go back to the slides. 
Through constant experimentation with materials, they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today, eventually resulting in, of course, the legendary lounge chair. 
We're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the South End. 
From my American perspective, when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences, she has every right to have that request met. 
(Applause) Which was awesome. 
So what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing this work, we actually surprised ourselves. 
That's me and my son on the floor. 
He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri, maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job, but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose. 
Thank you so much. (Applause) For years I've been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. 
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. 
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume? 
It can ignore that constant light, because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes. 
Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world. 
Therefore, it would be too risky to release these animals, both for the released and for the natural populations. 
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke. 
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. 
So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda. 
And you are noticing it more often. 
Play is the glue that binds us together. 
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. 
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university? 
We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have. 
That's not possible. 
the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc. 
Our friends think we're mad. 
As we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere, whether it be health care, patient care, engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos. 
Let's take an example. 
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters, and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala, the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful," or, as Sir Richard Burton -- not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature -- translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate." 
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see. 
They may have become slower, but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states. 
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht. 
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West. 
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known. 
Bohdan from Kiev said, in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace, We do not need everything that is there." 
You know why? 
That's no longer the province of science fiction. 
They'll never be able to cope." 
You need proteins for muscles, recovery. 
All the stories began to bleed together. 
A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. 
So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. 
When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. 
How was our role in this garden similar and different? 
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers. 
"Know thyself." 
I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. 
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. 
The first one is the Engels coefficient, which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade, in terms of family income, to about 37-some percent. 
Now, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles. 
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. 
We can do everything. 
It arises from not thinking." 
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new, or you might not know about. 
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions. 
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference. 
Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary. 
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. 
Let me confirm what she said. 
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight, and they spend less time thinking about food. 
Now, while as a journalist, Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation. 
Even when they're doing it for other reasons. 
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran. 
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up." 
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer, and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say." 
(Applause) If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine. 
The bad news is they're extinct. 
They sporulated, the spores attract insects, the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae. 
♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫ ♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫ ♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫ ♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫ ♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫ ♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫ ♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫ ♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫ ♫ Sell us a song, you're the music man ♫ ♫ My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go ♫ ♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫ 
And so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world, through video, through photos, through written history, and so people's experiences on that day, which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform. 
I've been doing this for the last 15 years; it's my side job, if you want. 
India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth, whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. 
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes -- charters, private schools, vouchers -- but we've had disappointing results year after year. 
And I just look at this, and I think, yes, we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets, by using elements of uncertainty, by using these multiple targets, by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system, by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets to collaborate and compete, to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. 
In fact, we were the only people in the universe. 
So, she's in the house. 
Now why. 
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves. 
But I'm not really concerned about the fuel. 
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way. 
I'm only saying positive things from now on. 
They pretty much do nothing. 
On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck, and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant. 
And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. 
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us. 
And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince" where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. 
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools? 
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills; somehow water's involved. 
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy. 
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices. 
You just twist leaves, and you see a whole new world of minute insects, or little spiders of one millimeter, one and a half, two millimeters long, and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. 
Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. 
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. 
No other animal does it. 
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil, gas, sorry. 
But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians. 
I think that is terrific. 
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture? 
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind, but she installed the latrine in a few hours. 
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it. 
So a microwave is a similar system. 
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated? 
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action; you only understand them when you put them into practice. 
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention, complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas. 
You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes, you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community -- corns, beans and squash and onions. 
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers. 
I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine. 
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it, and you hold it in and you hide it, and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it, you hide it, because the stigma in our society around depression is very real. 
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. 
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings, like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions. 
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. 
DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. 
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County, Virginia, the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
They have tiny little brains, yet they can do this very sophisticated medication. 
For instance, what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment? 
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them, you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae, leading to increased runoff and evaporation. 
But maybe it's something different. 
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. 
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them. 
We wouldn't have have that stuff, right? 
(Laughter) And we know it's incredibly ugly. 
Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. 
And now they've even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices, little GIS trackers like this, which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. 
Let's get him working on building different things. 
It's not virginity; it's fecundity. 
It collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA. 
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use? 
Sometimes they're very, very simple things. 
But the most surprising part was when we turned to, what are we going to work on in the week ahead? 
Thank you for listening to me today. 
"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up. 
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion. 
Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator. 
There's great feedback. 
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert. 
The bottom picture is Hitler youth. 
All the lines, the colored lines you see there, it's our high-capacity transportation network. 
It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe. 
There are a bunch of other of these biases, these cognitive biases, that affect our risk decisions. 
How do we realize Sylvia's dream? 
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding. 
And we managed to get that magic moment. 
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. 
Now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile. 
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. 
Thank you. 
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way. 
Stories cut across all boundaries, like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja," which were very popular throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia. 
Most education funding -- whether it's K through 12, or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets. 
And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes. 
Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did. 
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot. 
And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme, to do terrible things. 
This is the second shift: open aid. 
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. 
You think, "I put mine in the blue bin," and then you look at your colleague and say, "Why, you cretin. 
The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games, you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. 
I mean, it's crucified. 
So what can we do? 
The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey. 
And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. 
So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things, get other people involved -- and you're helping to come up with solutions. 
And in one sentence, he lifted me, put me back on my feet, and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure. 
I'm going to do some demonstrations. 
(Laughter) Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution, it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B. 
So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable, and George was a recluse. 
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. 
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. 
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me? 
My knife became a little sharper. 
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison are Americans, imprisoned in our country. 
And that is very useful information. 
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony." 
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time, and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive. 
(Phone ring) God damn it. 
What is the business here? 
Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on, not challenged by his peers, until after the crisis, of course. 
Here's our hamburger cutaway. 
But my tiger mother said, "No." 
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation. 
And in general, I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness, devastation, hopelessness. 
In fact, I don't read much of anything. 
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. 
Everything Lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world. 
We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents, and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable. 
And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? 
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi, the mathematical constant. 
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. 
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded. 
I didn't know that; that's pretty cool. 
And they have actualized compassion through direct action. 
We have no idea what we're going to discover. 
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life. 
There was a very interesting film, one of the rare good films done about a situation like this, by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition. 
But look: X marks the spot. 
(Crowd Noise) So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention," some of you just sat up. 
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at, much as we do on search. 
And I realized that, in order to know where I was going, I had to know where I'd been. 
All those ideas are already out there in print. 
He groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people. 
And that's pretty cool. 
They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. 
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies. 
And of course, this is nerd heaven, right? 
When does learning begin? 
I was like, "I don't know. 
It's like they were about to go play a football game. 
So are we all. 
She Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. 
Language really is the voice of our genes. 
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated. 
He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood. 
For each project we do a film. 
And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. 
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization. 
Juarez: You've heard of the border -- one of the most dangerous borders in the world. 
(Laughter) But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs, and being able to target those specifically is a first step. 
(Laughter) She gave me an indulgent smile, and as punishment, she said, "Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history, and you are sitting in it, and I'm grading you." 
This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard, a great portraitist. 
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop." 
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. 
We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees for pollination and, even more recently, as an economic commodity. 
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Is E.T. out there? 
As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. 
And what did it start? 
Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head, so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed, and we shot only his head. 
I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime. 
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people -- any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate. 
Now, because they are so non-interactive, they will actually escape the detector, so their signature will be missing energy, OK. 
And as we already heard, there is a way in which we are trying, and now able, to answer that question. 
They're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest. 
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet. 
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras. 
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. 
We had primary school actually started in 1842. 
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... 
It's been an interesting two weeks." 
This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound. 
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music. 
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries, that provide fish for the poor, that answer is more like $11,000. 
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. 
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting. 
Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger. 
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. 
By autumn, people thought the doctors should have solved this already. 
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. 
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong. 
We share written things, we share images, we share audio, we share video. 
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. 
In addition to cutaways, we also explain physics. 
Back on a spring day in 1889, the federal government held what they called a land run. 
A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world. 
The epiphany is that death is a part of life. 
Okay, here we go. 
And amazingly, you can still see what the best can do, because the crowd itself shines a light on them, either directly, through comments, ratings, email, Facebook, Twitter, or indirectly, through numbers of views, through links that point Google there. 
College graduates are not in short supply. 
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. 
The post-crisis projection is 2020. 
We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking. 
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long, because every time I saw Kofi Annan, I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it, and that was kind of what was going on. 
And you get a network that looks like this. 
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. 
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck. 
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. 
I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon. 
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any. 
So how are you going to respond to it? 
Fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research. 
Why does it take me months on end to get an export license from London or New York in order to get pieces into my country? 
It's environmentally responsible, efficient and humane. 
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. 
It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static. 
I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. 
And it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very, very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal, things like working in teams, doing practical projects, and putting them right at the heart of learning, rather than on the edges. 
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater. 
And we know what's happened in the past, so if we start now, and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term, we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old, I'll be able to say that it's been a success. 
And then I got my commercial pilot's license. 
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square. 
And I think every human, we all have different genetic backgrounds, we all have lived separate lives. 
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune? 
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day, the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. 
(Applause) I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds. 
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here." 
And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. 
The actual number is about 3,000, about two percent of that number. 
But we found that these people in the street, all of them are our reporters, feeding our newsroom with pictures, with videos and with news. 
I just had to go and build another machine. 
His name is Madhav Chavan, and he created something called Pratham. 
I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. 
He looked at the odds of another world war, of a massive volcanic eruption, even of an asteroid hitting the Earth. 
Mentors are just essential. 
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. 
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet. 
And that's not because of anything, but because we believed in our dream. 
Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true. 
As recently at last decade, most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. 
They've bounded the city with a line. 
You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. 
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler. 
So, this looks like a basketball playoff. 
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball, and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. 
Now, if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair, this is the kind of thing she was talking about. 
All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness. 
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in. 
And like any new technology, it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind, or not. 
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents. 
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery. 
And I thought, "Well, hey! 
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank and adds a message: "Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians." 
And that buys us about a factor of 20. 
In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it. 
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. 
Right? You want to be like, "Oh, dude, we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness." 
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. 
It's around us all the time. 
Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. 
You house is in a terrible state. 
Now, an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know. 
But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy, but is urging politicians to give them more signals, so that they can move even more rapidly. 
Favorite number. I love that number. 
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural. 
And as we were finishing up that film -- it was co-produced with National Geographic -- I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. 
I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono. 
He's the shaman of the Huaorani, and he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now; I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. 
And I'm not the first person to ask this question. 
One of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use, and to add design to it. 
I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying, "Where, oh where, can I find a picture of a cute cat?" 
I then, in the last few years, learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. 
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage, along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings. 
We're inside the Pike Place Market. 
That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. 
(Laughter). 
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this. 
This is a dead crystal, and I'm going to do something to it, and it's going to become alive. 
This is Hermann Goering. 
I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. 
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us. 
There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor. 
Obviously, there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth. 
What's the idea behind it? 
That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now. 
Are you serious about it, and not just, you know, when the consumers want it, when the regulators force us to do it we will go there? 
Until biofabrication is better understood, it is clear that, initially at least, more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods, no matter how delicious. 
Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child, but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time. 
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot? 
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true. 
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror. 
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts, you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs. 
We were growing plants like crazy. 
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. 
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever. 
(Laughter) And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. 
This is great. 
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life. 
But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the 21st century. 
Noise becomes music. 
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea. 
We have a new vaccine, we have new resolve, and we have new tactics. 
"Why do you say such things, Aboody?" 
But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world, I hope you take some of this stuff away with you, and when you have an opportunity to be influential, that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas. 
April. 
So the whole "Hells and Heavens" is about free will and determinism. 
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana. 
(Laughter) So, this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft -- except one. 
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever. 
The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine, you can start shooting at people. 
So given the prince loved his music, Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point. 
Well, that first cutaway picture worked, so we said, "Okay, let's do some more." 
They communicate their delight to their children, who respond with smiles, and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. 
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation. 
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. 
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children. 
This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain. 
Second, don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. 
(Singing) I'll stop it there in the interest of time. 
The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them. 
She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. 
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early -- got really addicted to finishing his homework early. 
They're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along. 
For the last 8 years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means. 
I had lost my belief. 
And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed. 
This object was made by a hominid ancestor, Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language. 
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old. 
It was simply awful for women. 
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before. 
And this is my world. 
So let's just walk our way through this. 
And then, you see, these were famine years. 
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later. 
First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking. 
And I personally am obsessed with morality. 
That would be the second best investment that we could do. 
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. 
(Applause) Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive? 
Now, water can flow or it can crash. 
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter) So — (Applause) — So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter) We've done it in 300 communities around the world. 
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- Copenhagen, climate change conference. 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. 
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class. 
It took them a while to formulate plan B. 
And it's happening during our lifetimes. 
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. 
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. 
I hope I have achieved that. 
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you. 
And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners. 
Now, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. 
In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy. 
But he also forgot that without consciousness, he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence. 
Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill. 
I graduated high school in May, and -- (Laughter) (Applause) — I graduated high school in May, and I decided that I was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that I've developed, these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes, but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people I've ever had the chance to work with, and I'm really prepared to make this a reality. 
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration, and it seemed to me high time, given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job. 
A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day. 
The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands, and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. 
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. 
Will it happen again? 
There are also real business benefits. 
Who's going to get enough out of the world? 
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. 
First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games. 
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach." 
(Applause) How would you like to be better than you are? 
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between. 
Fast-forward 50 years, and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications. 
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times. 
Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence, the demographics -- what sex, their age -- their income level within their own country, their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure. 
Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife. 
This repeats itself through the night -- rehearsal, tying to the mast, conning his way out of it, beating the poor first mate up mercilessly. 
To do this, at a certain point, you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock. 
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both. 
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. 
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. 
Yet, there is hope. 
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time, and in 2003, when I was 13 years old, my father became one of them. 
(Laughter) I'm serious. 
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides. 
So 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound) Very good. (Laughter) Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all. 
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars. 
Thank you very much. 
They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients. 
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical. 
It's a scientific drilling vessel. 
CA: Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP? 
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling." 
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures; you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat. 
And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide. 
Then I would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge. 
People are remaking things into fashion. 
He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. 
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May. 
From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. 
Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills. 
And they all have the same kind of features: highly collaborative, very personalized, often pervasive technology, learning that starts from questions and problems and projects, not from knowledge and curriculum. 
Oh. 
People cross oceans to go see them. 
Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land, with the commandments held by the leader. 
I'd been well treated by the crew, I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain, and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks, something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. 
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project, this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars, and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools, like hospitals and so on. 
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. 
And you'll buy it to protect the environment, even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected. 
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful. 
All of it, our food system. 
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again. 
And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. 
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army, about speed and aggression, you put that to one side. 
There are other dimensions for flaps. 
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness. 
So we now start this journey by telling our students that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) — and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how, God said, "One step at a time." 
We began the project with an interim report, which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many, many researchers. 
That spike was all Victoria. 
I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. 
But she was older. She was 12 years old, and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade. 
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. 
Soon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan. 
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. 
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. 
And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack, they get different. 
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen. 
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged. 
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here. 
I started a rule of first person perspective. 
So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal, and people start kind of coming into the office and saying, "Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great." 
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth. 
So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. 
If we show older, middle-aged, younger people images, like the ones you see on the screen, and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can, older people, but not younger people, remember more positive images than negative images. 
I want to hear that song. Untie me." 
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards. 
It appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like -- this is often what you get. Right? 
JE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them? 
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this? 
Political parties: oh boy. 
We're hungry for culture. 
The full data is on the website -- insideoutproject.net -- that is launching today. 
This is because of technology -- yeah. 
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you. 
The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past, a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. 
It can break sometimes. 
I write books and magazine articles. 
Like many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body. 
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. 
And this, let me tell you, is very good for the bottom line. 
So my first topic with respect to this, was not death, but obesity. 
So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need. 
I can help. 
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. 
We have major challenges, you can imagine, to finish this job, but as you've also seen, it's doable, it has great secondary benefits, and polio eradication is a great buy. 
Will you accept it?" 
Thanks. 
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely. 
Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, because it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. 
So, it's easy to find the good stuff, and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. 
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle. 
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it. 
Let's have a look at that. 
In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. 
Now I was pretty psyched. 
This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. 
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. 
The institutional model always pushes leftwards, treating these people as employees. 
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. 
And they didn't know that. 
It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. 
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. 
When we think about working memory, we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. 
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case. 
And yet I forget about it all the time. 
Now, that is difficult. 
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while. 
We also produce media for dissemination to the public -- free through the CyArk website. 
My gondola will be more simple than that. 
And so we, in the mixing process, have to develop the gluten, we have to activate the leaven or the yeast, and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. 
Why just run around? 
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced. 
Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose, California. 
That's really what marriage is about. 
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard? 
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that. 
Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know, children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK? 
We English teachers are the gatekeepers. 
Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. 
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries. 
We are wired to pursue happiness, not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it. 
(Laughter) OK. 
It involves an ongoing struggle, a continual questioning of what we think we know, a wrestling with issues and ideas. 
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. 
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. 
It would be their airplane tails. 
They use these to design with and they design for them, which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — (loud crowd noise) — and sound like this, shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion, or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds, with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system, making us jump out of our skins. 
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. 
Well it did. 
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK. 
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own. 
(Laughter) Let's see here. 
Would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me in one of those other versions of who I am? 
If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number, and that's why chessboards, eight by eight, have 64 squares. 
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner." 
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. 
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence. 
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there." 
In the scaling up, there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people, point by point, with the supply that you're making. 
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. 
Stories like this, signs like this, are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. 
And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing. 
It was one of the worst feelings of my life, as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again. 
As an accomplished computer user, what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web. 
So zooming back out real quick, we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner. 
You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied. 
They want to share the experience. 
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years. 
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. 
In this example, facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. 
But the way the symmetries interact enable us -- we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. 
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others. 
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole, geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. 
We hold another conference. 
And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. 
Civilizations and cultures, which had been ignored, which had no voice, which were not listened to, which were not known about, will have a different sort of representation in this world. 
Is it the leeches? Is it something else? 
And here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius, but everybody is obliged to participate. 
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life. 
Thank you. (Applause) Every presentation needs this slide in it. 
By the time my generation walked the streets, disinvestment at the local, state and federal level, eroded infrastructure, and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. 
Is that something? 
This is Kimbo. 
It means that their children's development can be compromised. 
So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this. 
We're going to be okay." 
And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice, so that macroscopically it looks the same. 
That's an awful lot of debt. 
This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. 
There's not really a lot of community support around it. 
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. 
But as they become more and more accurate, we've determined that this information is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life. 
No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. 
So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this. 
My foster father didn't intend to change my life. 
So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity. 
they would say, "I've got six friends. 
Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view. 
Now, there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market, particularly when they're young men. 
When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right? 
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days, was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet, but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin. 
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. 
What about a great depression? 
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. 
One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you. 
My dad has Alzheimer's disease. 
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. 
(Applause) People talk loudly and slowly to me. 
And it's no surprise that people died, because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale, what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on. 
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole. 
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists. 
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 
It is an increasingly difficult picture, even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do. 
They have different assets, commercial and military. 
I'm trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old moss, which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. 
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos. 
One, play is universal. 
(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas. 
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here. 
So what we need to do is we have to effect it. 
(Laughter) I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot. 
That's what it's about. 
That database contained the timing of attacks, the location, the size and the weapons used. 
And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. 
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here." 
(Applause) For example, fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color, (Laughter) much more than the average TEDTalk. 
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. 
And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. 
It's a kind of mechanistic world that we'd all love to live in where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets, everything is numerically expressible, and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success. 
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. 
Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine. 
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse, they had trade with the mother country -- Norway -- and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker, partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway. 
Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people? 
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do. 
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling. 
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. 
We genetically engineer bacteria. 
Here in California, there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions. 
So if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor, because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you're still young, it's really great. 
And the question is, who do you want to remember -- if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother? 
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals that are very, very tiny. 
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail. 
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there. 
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan. 
(Laughter) Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. 
And outside the library, I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind. 
The answer is no, there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. 
Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx. 
In fact, they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music. 
We have so much room to grow. 
And here's the front door of this facility. 
When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?" 
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. 
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. 
Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. 
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. 
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen. 
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. 
And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible. 
One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be, and won't show the product to little girls. 
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character, and, you know, movies and TV shows, these things have influence. My own website. 
No wonder so many of my people spit bars, because the truth is hard to swallow. 
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. 
Take a look at Changing the Present, started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present. 
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear. 
Here's an example: A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system. 
But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization. 
If we call something impossible, we act in such a way that we make it so. 
He said, "I would tell them what I know, and that is everybody dies, but not everybody lives. 
Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds. 
We took 50 of those girls and we worked with them. 
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. 
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. 
Where do women get fat? 
Could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be? 
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. 
"Ah ha! American, great." 
My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent. 
You want to see God. 
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture. 
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it. 
They started making their own video games. 
Durable, engineered, permanent -- those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral. 
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today. 
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices. 
And I thought, well, what is that relationship? 
And this goes on for thousands of years, because these are hard questions, and I've only got 15 minutes. 
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know. 
I mean, there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world -- within the E.U., between China and the United States. 
And that's how powerful the one negative is. 
I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing. 
(Laughter) And actually you use it and it's actually useful. 
If we could -- correction, wrong figure -- 13 billion used every year. 
And I'm showing you something else with these maps. 
And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. 
I'm not married, but one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma, following a double lung transplant. 
They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom. 
One of those dark spots is Madagascar, a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. 
Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -- same way -- had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively. 
And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. 
And there's a book -- John Gartner. 
And because we must all work to finish this story. 
These all happen to be on our computers, on computers across the world. 
Or, "He won't stop raping me. 
D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much. 
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles. 
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe, if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff, it does take about 30 hours. 
But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration. 
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons. 
They can go into your skin and create skin infections. 
That's also an insult to history. 
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries, every problem is an opportunity, and the more difficult the problem, the greater will be the importance of its solution. 
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible. 
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more. 
OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers, as teachers often think, but actually from common sense, from experience of the world around them, from all the things that go on between them and their peers, and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience. 
The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. 
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court. 
It should be more like private accounting. 
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck, we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters for the objects that people like. 
And then the cell splits down the middle. 
And nobody minds that. We actively welcome it. 
We call this the biomimetic paradigm -- copying nature in the lab. 
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves. 
We are talking about an accountable society, a society that is fair and just, and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market. 
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab. 
(Laughter) How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me? Raise your hand. 
There was a big case in February 2009 called "Elude the Cat." 
This is a very impressive record indeed. 
But we really need to test that. 
That was much better. 
And that doesn't even count, for example, that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. 
And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all, many people around the world have been wondering, how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football, run around in this desert climate? How would it be possible that spectators sit, enjoy themselves in open-air stadia in this hot environment? 
The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint. 
And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects. 
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? 
And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community. 
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful. 
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours, but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, and we're imprisoned in our three. 
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head? 
When's the last time you used a travel agent? 
But the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works. 
While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. 
But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important. 
Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place that has nothing to offer? 
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception, a little bit, right? 
And because of this left weighting, the average is actually here, way to the left. 
The "fix," as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than, say, a $50 check or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses, or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. 
So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter. 
I think it was circumstantial. 
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough." 
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage. 
Josh. 
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it. 
Which one of these guys am I actually related to? 
And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. 
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it. 
So I was positive that, if somehow we can make things mimic life, let's go one step further. 
It has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement. 
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood, and be understood by the brain. 
These are all the first cloned animals of their type. 
(Laughter) Yes. 
(Laughter) Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa, and start planning another expedition. This time, I wanted to go right across, on my own this time, from Russia, at the top of the map, to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is, and then on to Canada. 
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. 
As you can see with your own eyes. 
It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction. 
One, empire was the least original thing that the West did after 1500. 
So, since the transistor is so simple, you can put lots of them together. 
Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world. 
We're losing our sites and the stories, and basically we're losing a piece -- and a significant piece -- of our collective memory. 
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper, so there was some evidence left. 
And I did that; I put on my ritualistic dress; I went to the holy mosque; I did my prayers; I observed all the rituals. 
(Applause) The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you. 
Tens of thousands of active volcanoes. 
But watch what happens here. 
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out. 
That's all I have at the point of sale. 
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it, I saw all the mistakes, I saw ... 
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom. 
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me." 
The voice asks, "Who is there?" 
They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. 
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States, of Canada, and an international institution from Syria. 
And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not, or to be somebody that you aren't? 
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." 
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets. 
This was a small model. 
And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly. 
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart, and we all know how important it is to heal. 
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about. 
I mean, if I just go through some of them now -- I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects, and that does it consummately well, you can see it can. 
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price. 
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good, except I told this to imaginary friends around me, which was not so good. 
You're probably asking that. Why should you care? 
But, of course, our secular religion is technology. 
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said, "Conducting, Charles, is like holding a small bird in your hand. 
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. 
He's totally wrong about this one. 
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking, to think in a long-term, more consequential way. 
I know if you're good to give a loan to. 
Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. 
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there, and so, watch out. 
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. 
Two: operate on the right scale. 
(Music) Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do before we even think. 
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now. 
This is "Break Clustered." 
Still, we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air, off the ground, like it was supposed to be. 
And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great. 
So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself. 
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well. 
Of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing, inadvertently, creativity, individual self-expression and innovation. 
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV, shifted the vote by 10 percent, according to a Kenyan intelligence report, which changed the result of the election. 
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight, which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere, the upper stratosphere, 40 km up. 
Is it working? 
And if I can't be educated, when I see some of my sisters being educated, my wish has been fulfilled. 
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane -- the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade. 
And that's certainly been my experience with transition. 
The CDC has a program, Heads Up. 
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours. 
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job. 
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. 
So canny outlaws are better than nothing, but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. 
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel." 
That makes a good cartoon. 
So please, wait for the conductor. 
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. 
This is a moment, one moment captured across multiple cameras. 
Teacher: Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing. 
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up. 
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. 
And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it. 
They are more our social identities. 
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before. 
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it? 
Think about yin and yang. 
But despite our electoral mandate, the markets mistrusted us. 
And it's good that it's not too quick. 
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter. 
He kept going like this to me. 
I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people. 
And that is this: the farm is called Polyface, which means ... 
For every one single neuron, you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time you learn something, or you have an experience, that bush grows, you know, that bush of information. 
The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. 
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while. 
When they're entering a new market, they send a family member to supervise it, or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties. 
Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people, it turned out, in the U.K. -- and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could make a low pressure, non-toxic refrigerator. 
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know. 
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water? 
Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them: Understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages, or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar and system of logic. 
You can sleep in clean sheets. 
So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict. 
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V. 
Thank you very much. 
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. 
In some other countries, the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced. 
When disaster strikes -- the economy gets blown, people lose a job, floods, war, conflict, bad governance, all of those things -- there is nothing to fall back on. 
And it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it. 
And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves. 
No pavement. 
And I think I've found a few. 
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. 
We're here, none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us, not because we checked, but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. 
But nonetheless, despite the hostility, firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. 
So I said, "Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?" 
But it brings me back. 
She's not amused. Let's think about it. 
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. 
Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. 
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car. 
And that's the good news I have. We can do that. 
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure. 
Let's play a little. 
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel. 
Video: On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record. 
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs -- any of the cool stuff we've got now. 
Which one is it? 
And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle. 
And as we danced and danced, and we approached this circle of women, men, women, children, everybody was there. 
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys. 
Ah, what a wonderful smell." 
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. 
Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth. 
Let's just think through that idea. 
And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. 
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. 
And actually, it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments. 
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home. 
It's your land; it's your resource. 
(Applause) Once again. 
DM: It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds. 
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue. 
Well it doesn't break even. 
My body was consumed by pain. 
This is a key issue. 
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard: A people's dream died there, and it was a beautiful dream." 
It was clean, efficient, there was no high, there was really no danger, it had no street value. 
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. 
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted -- it's actually a remarkable achievement, to produce something that's that democratic. 
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. 
So different structural locations have different implications for your life. 
If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed, if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge, it would be half that size still. 
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands, once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. 
The two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." 
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo, I basically stayed up all night. 
Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. 
This may actually be heresy to say this at TED, but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation, I think, in medicine to come in the next 10 years, and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch, to comfort, to diagnose and to bring about treatment. 
Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want, and you can do it in three ways. 
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. 
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?" 
For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- (Laughter) across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. 
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen. 
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. 
Because the self likes to fit, to see itself replicated, to belong. 
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. 
So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary, we really focused on doing as little new as possible. 
So that's why we don't think it exists, the Sufi masters working on us. 
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord." 
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success. 
We English teachers reject them all the time. 
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine, but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble. 
(Laughter) So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. 
Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? 
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. 
And that unity is something that connects all of creation. 
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. 
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. 
Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and, indeed, even from further away, in California. 
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. 
Or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department, see what they say. 
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. 
I, overly optimistically, had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe, for the world, to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions. 
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable, that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus. 
And when we do these kind of things, when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors, then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants, and no one intended. 
Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. 
When I married my wife, I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. 
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle, so I get out of the house a fair bit. 
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community. 
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure, so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees? 
So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent -- a lot more recent than the 1650s. 
On one particular occasion, one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory while it was full of prisoners. 
And by the time you get to the middle, you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each. 
Thank you and God bless you. 
And I said, "Well what makes it great?" 
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater; you actually improve. 
Today, stories continue to transcend borders. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline. 
And this was a pretty common sight. 
It was a really extraordinary moment. 
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance. 
They've lived in Italy for a number of years. 
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these. 
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out. 
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience. 
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble. 
From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time. 
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion. 
A large fraction of those people are in the United States. 
So there it is, I've said it again. 
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one. 
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel, ate it and, you know, talked and left. 
But before I do that, I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics, which require huge amounts of energy to create and, because of their disposal issues, are slowly poisoning our planet. 
And they can also sense their motion and tilt. 
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. 
So I decided to go there. 
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks, and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him, and I thought, is that what he's thinking about? 
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations. 
So what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up." 
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder. 
You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens, that term originated there. 
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick, of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. 
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act. 
Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. 
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. 
In fact, I made a living by walking. 
As an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni, in hiding currently in Yemen, who inspired a Nigerian, son of the head of Nigeria's national bank. 
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself. 
His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state, where public officials were enriching themselves, [rather] than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling. 
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. 
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. 
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. 
All the previous trials were positive, and we know this one's gonna be too." 
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. 
This next is the Sudanese girl, a few moments from death, a vulture hovering in the background, a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty. 
(Applause) I love to collect things. 
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade. 
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency." 
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis, and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. 
He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender. 
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging. 
So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian, you would want to become a Chinese in order to live 10 years longer. 
He always proves us wrong. 
What's natural about foie gras? 
If they won't submit, kill them. 
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices, and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle: When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages; and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours. 
And in particular, I think we can learn things about learning. 
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. 
It turns out that the word "happiness" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. 
There is a potential to do good as well. 
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. 
And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years. 
You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20. 
And with knowing comes caring. 
We don't keep them all. 
Everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids. 
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape, right in the middle is 150 million degrees. 
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this? 
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. 
I'm going into some details here, because [the] U.N. do it like this. 
Turing's machine was entirely theoretical. 
So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems. 
On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing. 
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. 
You think you've got a tough job? 
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore. 
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg, and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film. 
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright, and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures. 
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here. 
And our goal was to assemble the leaders, both teachers and students, in these exponentially growing information technologies, and their application. 
But," she said, "but they did not touch my breasts." 
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. 
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person? 
They work in the same way. 
That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations. 
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative. 
Because, if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. 
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. 
But then what was the answer of the regime? 
Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. 
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. 
The flash is like a scream for help. 
You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon." 
It's this pinwheel of light, and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as 300 feet away by a predator. 
I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. 
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family. 
Growth was negative. 
Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space, and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. 
For example: "Evan Williams." 
Because in nature, mushrooms are the recycling system. 
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter. 
This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class, it's the cruet salt and pepper set. 
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency. 
Because it does seem to me that large organizations including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all, have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people. 
Because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks. 
Newborn babies can't do much, but one thing they're really good at is sucking. 
On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later. 
(Laughter) (Applause) These are clearly biblical archetypes, and the thinking behind that was to create positive, globally-resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. 
It's the Second World War. 
So let's talk about effectiveness. 
He was also the ultimate self-learner, and like everything else, he did it in grand style. 
And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. 
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion, and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die. 
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world. 
Exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding, is mind-blowing. 
They jump high. They wear red. 
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain." 
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately. 
And every street lamp could be a free access point. 
The mother came to me, knelt down, and said, "Leymah, take my daughter. 
The first time, nothing will happen, because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull." 
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl. 
And there's the temperature up there in 2009. 
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. 
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later. 
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order. 
He doesn't need Adam. 
I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. 
Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret. 
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. 
That's at 78 degrees north. 
And by 1950, they were everywhere. 
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. 
So, I share it with all of you here today, though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. 
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had an Agile Thanksgiving, where you had one group of people working on the food, one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door. 
Now I remember a few years ago, a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here, president of Qatar University -- who, by the way, is a woman -- he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way. 
And we're almost there. 
(Applause) All buildings today have something in common. 
The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. 
This becomes your mission. That is all you do. 
So let me tell you a story. 
So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans, to help us make America great again. 
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago. 
And after the trial had been running for a little while, he gathered together all his colleagues around his table, and he said, "Well, gentlemen, we have some preliminary results. 
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. 
Often, we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever. 
How many digits are there in your number? 
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands, usually the left hand. 
During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. 
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. 
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them." 
Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work: interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls, ages seven to 12, all over the United States -- except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample. 
Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy. 
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at, where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars, all at once, every half hour, and very precisely. 
And as he did so, his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving, were words. 
So it evolved. 
And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit, you'll see that they're fundamentally different. 
Take for example the case of lions. 
We need more reinvention. 
They don’t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it. 
What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote, took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc., etc." 
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist. 
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe. 
So she's struck with pity. 
Books came from donated schoolbooks. 
For the first time, actually, in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs, and see for myself what their lives were actually about. 
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106. 
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ... 
It's one of those things. 
It's important for us to grow organically. 
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real. 
If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though, I wouldn't have that luxury. 
And what is it that really makes us us? 
And here I am today. 
And their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the Scud missile launchers, those surface-to-air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis? 
He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile and of the giraffe. 
He's named after the Star Trek character. 
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are, but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. 
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. 
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you." 
Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. 
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled. 
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years. 
Five months later, that is Angeline. 
And we've also got to be aware that experts, of course, also make mistakes. 
Thank you. 
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope. 
So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. 
Knock knock. Is anyone home? 
But if we think differently, I think that, in fact, we can have cities that are not only zero emissions, but have unlimited possibilities as well. 
What has been my challenge? 
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. 
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. 
Let's start at the beginning. 
That's what perspective is all about. 
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. 
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy, and cannot wish not to be so. 
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life, but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side. 
But today I have been transformed. 
Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen. 
It hardly happens. 
Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection. 
Think of it in terms of drums of water, each containing 200 liters. 
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting, but also it tells us something, I think, about the stock market situation we're in. 
Here's an example of one such text. 
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one. 
Whatever it is, you can go so far. 
Bike volumes have spiked. 
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. 
But again, these are done in these primordial conditions, really messy conditions, not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. 
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. 
(Video): (Singing) You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult. 
So we started off with about 12 volunteers, and then we had about 50, and then a couple hundred. 
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. 
Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy. 
You don't just zip right into it. 
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys, but only to show me there's peaks, and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light. 
When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers, they’re following a script that they’ve agreed to. 
It's not whose army wins; it's also whose story wins. 
It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt, and where he got his inspiration. 
And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them, so I just did it anyway. 
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison," so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison. 
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. 
And also, actually, I've been your mother. 
Why is methane important? 
But the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children. 
For example, one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine. 
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did. 
My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. 
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. 
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier." 
And I'm not comfortable with that. 
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time. 
So we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding. 
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. 
And what we see is sort of amazing because there's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well. 
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. 
Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere. 
And if I can broaden this out for a second, I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence, about movies, probably about literature. 
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness. 
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics. 
Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for." 
Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. 
Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. 
In terms of patents, there's no question that the East is ahead. 
And it been growing for about 600 years. 
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. 
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said, "The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once." 
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners, and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G keep brands separate, like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand. 
It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it. 
And this is what he came up with. 
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. 
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his, the three-year-old comes up with another explanation: He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it, because now it's dirty, on the ground. 
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot that animates us all the time. 
You'd need millions and millions of teachers in China, India, Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need. 
And last, we talked about loss aversion, and the monkeys and the apples. 
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. 
(Music) (Applause) L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy. 
Everybody sitting in a basket, and I was on top of the balloon, ready to slide down with my skysurf board. 
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative. 
The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely. 
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use, whether you're eight or 80. 
(Applause) This is all in 3D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points. 
And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology. 
That's what I wanted to do. 
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries, which come in at thousands per second, are available everywhere there is power. 
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names, we do a random sample, we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities, and then we publish the results. 
I do something, put it back down again. 
They did it with puppies. 
But we can look at the world, and try to understand where we are in its context, and how we choose to interact with it. 
But you need very, very large volumes of water in order to do this. 
And I think that we will. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So my name is Taylor Wilson. 
She was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation. 
But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. 
And they even slow the flow of genes. 
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought. 
And when we enter into this century, you'll find more than half of mankind down here. 
It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have. 
I don't think they're a simple model of anything. 
We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes, where they're not supposed to be. 
They aren't getting any input, so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information -- that is, he or she is blind. 
He just knows how to run a company. 
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. 
We have the capacity to laugh and cry. 
Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. 
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. 
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset. 
But here's how the whole thing fits together. 
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. 
And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. 
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine. 
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive. 
It's all "figure." 
Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up, and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. 
Social media changed Chinese mindset. 
What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin. 
Secondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with. 
The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later. 
When the architects came, they brought us these things, and you've probably seen things like this. 
They are not missing because they've died; they were never born. 
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. 
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out. 
Just a few quick before and after shots. 
And you push them together and they repel. 
Here, in a photo by Brian, a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. 
Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. 
It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you. 
And then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore. 
And their sovereignties, cross-cutting, globally interlinked, can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways, but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world. 
Children don't choose a school. 
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines, have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse. 
He has a character describing the snowflake, and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death." 
We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground. 
This model is all about choices, both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places. 
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated. 
Thank you. 
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though, which is amazingly green. 
That's because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. 
(Laughter) So I went to Russia, and my mother also, [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union. 
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere. 
They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. 
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. 
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts. 
How are they different, and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China, or at large, the world? 
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it, not just with big businesses, but small businesses all over the country. 
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it, though luckily, they lost interest before killing it. 
What are you going to do with it?" 
So three pieces of data for each country -- three pieces of data. 
(Music) (Applause) We've got a real problem with math education right now. 
It's a wonderful way to find genes. 
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not. 
I thought, it'll have to do. 
He retreated into silence. 
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. 
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes, and here we are, right in the middle. 
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream," and the other one is Hitler. 
CA: So certainly, the mind of your cars is pretty mind-boggling. 
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. 
Women, back in the late 19th century, spent two days a week doing the laundry. 
Your chances are very low. 
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. 
So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other, take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools, and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection, a world of understanding and a world of peace. 
But they're about to create what they call a Green List, and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you, species that were endangered, like the bald eagle, but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work, and protected areas around the world that are very, very well managed. 
We have access to it all. 
We can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?" 
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. 
Steaming ought to be faster. 
So then you have the villain containment unit, where kids put their parents. You have the office. 
Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments. 
What I didn't tell David at the time was I myself wasn't convinced it would work. 
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. 
That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized, to achieve large and complex tasks, like innovating new software programs. 
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity, and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient, between 45 and 50 percent efficiency. 
What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned -- so in other words, the relationship between words and what they're about in the world. 
In hospitals, they are security issues. 
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. 
That is a huge effect. 
So the data on dropping out is amazing. 
When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive, it reaches you almost to a cellular level. 
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow, which is the organ of memory. 
Here's me singing "Sleep." 
There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. 
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy? 
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body. 
I mean, it's just wonderful. 
Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic. 
Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. 
So within a few years, in the late 1800s, early 1900s, all of a sudden, the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis. 
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things that they're learning. 
You need also state ownership, especially of land assets, in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. 
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford, one lakh car, $2,000 car." 
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. 
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation. 
(Laughter) Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right? 
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom, we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer. 
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this. 
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again. 
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. 
So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say. 
I was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst. Habibi, my friend." 
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate, and underneath that plate, there is a magnet. 
And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe; America is slightly different -- but Europeans by and large, I have to say, are ignorant, are unaware about the way the world is changing. 
The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. 
And it's something that people have wanted forever. 
And the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain. 
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So, if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. 
He's still dreaming about it. 
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. 
But they asked me for a promise basically. 
How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am? (Laughter) Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background. 
So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. 
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate. 
And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. 
So here's another example. 
And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow. 
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do, and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. 
It's very flat, kind of rigid. 
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. 
But as the article mentions, because of enzyme breakdown, it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally. 
Today I want to tell you about such a device. 
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: "and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc." 
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I? 
Thank you. 
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music, I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water. 
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?" 
Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very, very different civilizational roots. 
The Charter of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. 
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me, so I won't talk about it. 
Sharmeen is actually here. 
It's always about my taste. 
He doesn't know how to cure it. 
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room. 
This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed by one of Britain's top architects. 
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco, and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. 
But there are legitimate secrets -- you know, your records with your doctor; that's a legitimate secret -- but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated. 
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight, and you can repair this thing. 
The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken. 
In day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction. 
Anonymous: Dear Fox News, it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged. 
Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid, or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing. 
(Laughter) Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs -- has been used for injecting into wrinkles. 
I mean, people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. 
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. 
Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938. 
I don't know what the answer is to that. 
CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to it. 
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions. 
You'll find your own way to discover, to learn, to teach. 
(Laughter) And in case you think that poster's just propaganda, here's Priyanka, 23 years old. 
He does the transportation and distribution, and she does the production and sourcing. 
Okay? Ready? 
So that is our lake, if you can see it. 
"Sustainable proteins," he said. 
So I whistle the tone. 
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square, and next to that, a three-by-three square, beneath that, a five-by-five square, and then an eight-by-eight square, creating one giant rectangle, right? 
Now this is a very complicated struggle. 
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community. 
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. 
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources. 
And that's why he moved to Michigan. 
They find their way to self-assemble. 
And so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome? 
Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey. 
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge. 
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum." 
As you can see, these images aren't really special. 
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. 
SW: And the penguin? 
NA: On Twitter also. 
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment, is going to make a difference, not just for a few, but for everyone. 
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture." 
Reward: this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements -- the external states, our internal states, how do we feel, and so on are put together. 
Oars are not supposed to look like this. 
And here's another example for one of these side effects. 
And that silence just outside a doctor's office, that many of us know. 
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. 
And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- four percent of the world's population. 
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. 
Place cells are also being recorded in humans. 
She went off, she got a penguin. 
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. 
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back. 
And it's 12 units used in the entire world, and the richest one billion, they use six of them. 
Thank you very much. 
And it's all about international writing systems. 
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing. 
So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before; imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. 
This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift, where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car, who were carrying their entire family in a scooter, started dreaming of being in a car. 
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. 
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007. 
And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture, I failed at that. 
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right. 
There was a big decline in coffee prices. 
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. 
(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language. 
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think, but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right? 
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies. 
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. 
They moved on to some other situation. 
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed, but I was not the only one there who had that reaction. 
You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland. 
It's a holy war against Muslims. 
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter." 
Here's the final hamburger. 
Smile, friendly. 
Would you rather be C or D? 
Well, that's a good question. 
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time. 
And if that's true, then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American. 
But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it -- into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974 and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. 
They do a very good job because their children are eating their food, but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect, and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. 
And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. 
And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities, that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars. 
Well, the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend. 
You have anti-colonization. 
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website, which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. 
But it was really brutal. 
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. 
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently, and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin, and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive and differentiated, depending on where it is. 
If I duck down, he'll follow me. 
So we're going to start that video. 
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47. 
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it. 
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself. 
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens. 
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. 
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty. 
You may say this is not fair, because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy. 
But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way, and most girls tend to be a certain way. 
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source, which is dung. 
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next." 
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. 
It looks like our table also can transform gender, too. 
(Applause) So when did this habit start? 
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me. 
Thank you. 
We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they'll build. 
So once you have these attributes of this material, then you can do a lot of things. 
One is: preserve choices for people. 
But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change. 
We just want it to vanish. 
In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries. 
They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt! 
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where you know that they've been conducted and completed, and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA. 
I'm now going to talk about feasibility. 
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all. 
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they're taking statistics. 
And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles, it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me? 
But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil, and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial. 
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. 
Let's look at neurons. 
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." 
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope. 
You're very happy about this part. 
So PIPA and SOPA are round two. 
That's a question for the future. 
After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid. 
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods. 
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. 
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. 
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. 
CA: So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate, but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is? 
That's a wonderful insight, but it leaves something out. 
(Laughter) We're told what to wear -- (Laughter) -- and how to do our hair -- (Laughter) -- and how to behave. 
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well, Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away. 
Well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old. 
And 50 years from now, all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. 
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. 
I want to go full spectrum and tell you how, in the process of developing this new technology, we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as lessons for innovation, ideas worth spreading. 
I think that vote is occurring right now. 
We choose our own profession, and we choose our own partners. 
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated. 
You see, only that way you can be able to understand him. 
The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square. 
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. 
How could it be that children are doing statistics? 
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. 
And of course, what's especially good is, if you type "design and emotion," the first response out of those 10 pages is my website. 
There's other ways of making flaps. 
Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies, and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist: question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. 
In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world. 
(Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. 
["The 99"] Thank you. 
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects. 
So now give me this banana." 
He kept one under the pillows on our bed, and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. 
It's something called the reward schedule. 
We've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components. 
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes, dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla. 
And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. 
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is, "What if those scientists are right?" 
We end up with things we've heard about before: red tides, for example, which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage. 
You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow. 
I would look at the tongue. 
So, will we find the whole of physics? 
We find that premise quite exciting. 
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship. 
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. 
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs, productivity, employment, child nutrition, maternal mortality, literacy and much, much more. 
Let me talk about my own experience. 
But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college. 
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you. 
But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. 
In other words, you need to understand how ideas have sex. 
So just like the breast cancer story, doing research, getting awareness going, it works, you just have to get it going. 
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. 
(Laughter) But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. 
Thank you. 
How did this happen? 
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys, you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. 
And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. 
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific? 
I think that's its real importance. 
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. 
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile? 
I was also pregnant at the time. 
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. 
So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive. 
It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away. 
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town, Bangalore. 
(Music) (Music) CL: Okay, so it works. 
See, second time for the same player. 
And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. 
They cheat just by a little bit. 
Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. 
Now how do the two brains work with each other? 
Did it strike you? 
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty. 
And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. 
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina. 
Everything is everything. 
That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists. 
These are some of the images and the characters of the film. 
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. 
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment, public health, and food security at risk. 
We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between. 
Right? Like, seriously, nobody would do this. 
There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background, and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole. 
We lived in New York City, as I said. 
Hope kept me alive. 
We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them, areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are, areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years, the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country. 
It inhales oxygen, just like we do. 
An infection ravaged my skin. 
Not years ago, not months ago, days ago. 
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. 
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. 
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools, just as our ancestors may have made them, two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other. 
One story leads to another. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social, is I had to sell my work, and not myself. 
The girls just shook their heads, put them in their hands, and let me go my own way. 
But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico, where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal, they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants. 
I mean, these kids were web-taught, but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. 
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks. 
That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things. 
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know, or what we're going to learn, about something? 
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter. 
In fact, people were extremely frustrated. 
For those of you who think that new media of the Internet could somehow help us avert genocide, should look no further than Rwanda, where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place. 
The catch, however, to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster. 
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful. 
The most important one being fun. 
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it. 
We can fly around them. 
This is Siberian Actinobacteria, which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old. 
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents. 
2006 was a great year. 
Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works. 
So I finished, and it was a success in a sense. 
The classic answer is to form an institution, right? 
Refugee return, which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely, has largely happened. 
I took up the little baby, massaged her, forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally. 
How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million. 
Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff. 
If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime." 
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty. 
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? 
Now I told you -- (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do. 
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. 
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. 
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. 
(Laughter) This sound colors our first impression of any room; it can't be helped. 
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. 
Go along with the video. Look. 
The highest concentrations are in red. 
You'd totally be surprised. 
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones. 
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush, live on Bureau of Land Management land, and that's very different from being protected in a national park. 
The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. 
And can I also make a small message to my mom? 
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me, which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document. 
It was called the Vaitarani. 
And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department, is to eat, and I did that very well, and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. 
The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S. 
But with the type of cuts we're talking about, it will be far, far harder to get these incentives for excellence, or to move over to use technology in the new way. 
I mean, that's a great design. 
That's what's happening here. 
You can't see the danger at your door. 
I call that the hidden choir. 
So, Mr. Gore, thank you. 
It's because my mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. 
The paper said, "It's not really balanced. 
When will you include the child in the city? 
Because of this accelerated pace of destruction, it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work. 
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components, and look at the diversity that came out of that. 
Have you ever been divorced? 
So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard. 
And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. 
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on. 
And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, "Oh my God! 
I really got close to design again. 
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. 
I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll. 
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see. 
It's beautiful and it's functional. 
But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole, for the proof of a black hole, is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. 
In this school, there was a simple idea: to create comfort in a classroom. 
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water. 
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?" 
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively, and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. 
It's sort of "me," not "we." 
And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G20. 
One of the problems is coming up with the right target. 
It sends out what's called a MIDI signal -- or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface -- through these wires into the box and then the computer, which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this. 
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter, if we looked at your gut, up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter. 
Most of what we do is subconscious. 
Presumably, modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa. 
I see some nodding heads there. 
It's not very challenging any more. 
And that's when they ran into trouble. 
And I'm trying harder and harder. 
Why don't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice? 
By the time we get there, every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way. 
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box, and this one can change its shape. 
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there. 
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition to get there, and we need to pave that great transition with good things. 
And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. 
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years. 
It doesn't matter the technology. 
I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world. 
A year and a half -- she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country. 
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple. 
And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there. 
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller, who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer. 
So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them. 
Secondly you need skills, the mundane skills of the construction sector. 
The Freudian model is really one continuum that, as you get less miserable, you get happier. 
about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology, about innovating from constraint, about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials. 
(Laughter) He said, "You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray." 
This is Lake Baikal. 
I had to meet my Prime Minister. 
We've done this for a very difficult case, which was for deforestation in China. 
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself; he never asks about the woman." 
It's not the same with language. 
So, we create silence as much as we create sound. 
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. 
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. 
And this is critically important because, one year ago, the African penguin was declared endangered. 
And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold. 
Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it. 
And the breast cancer campaign -- again, this is not a competition. 
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. 
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers? 
Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over 66 Qatari women filmmakers to edit, tell their own stories in their own voices. 
So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. 
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists. 
So this is the strange demographic of the zone -- isolated alone together. 
CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it. 
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag. 
This is Alfred Gonzalez. 
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application, web, and now even a controllable thermostat, and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world. 
I don't think so. 
We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks -- so flying versus driving. 
But what a shame that it's not organized to help authors create movements. 
Now you would expect, given that, that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens, but instead Odysseus says, "I want to hear that song. 
That has to stop. 
You say it. 
It seems so elementary. 
People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. 
They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas. 
My hunches again. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this, and even there, it is him who advises them. 
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu? 
(Laughter) And that number 72 never appears. 
"Bring these kids home because they are misled." 
(Laughter) The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No." 
So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life," where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. 
So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony, but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. 
Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior. 
What is the cost of not trying? 
I was not planning on showing you any meat because, of course, half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are. 
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiology, but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature. 
(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. 
So I was filming. 
And this is very important. At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India, there are actually two demographic curves. 
So is that just another version of this? 
And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage. 
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life. 
It's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that. 
I was intensely moved during all this. 
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives. 
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. 
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons, you can see the speed, you can see the way where I was flying. 
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up. 
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. 
They hardly ever make mistakes. 
It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional. 
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do. 
That's just 12 percent of the population. 
So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists, and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro. 
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading, but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math. 
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife. 
On the top left, underneath those green stripes, you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. 
And I was driving home one day, and I get a phone call from the husband's friend, calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend. 
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job. 
However, to my surprise, I discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily. 
And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. 
So I interrupted him. I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" 
They get sick like you. They get sick like me. 
But if we want to make something hard, we come up, "I know, I'm going to make a hard substance. 
So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons. 
I picked two well-known examples, because they're very well-known for expressing science through art. 
(Applause) The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer. 
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence, this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new." 
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. 
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long, you can only run one of these reactors for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.) This is one of the jackets you grew? 
That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption. 
So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. 
There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could. 
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep. 
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. 
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there, and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being, because it just keeps getting worse. 
I knew the journey would be risky, but I would be risking my life either way. 
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want to categorize new things very, very quickly. 
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah! 
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. 
My mom says, "Protest march." 
So if sales start to drop, then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. 
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things, even if they don’t seem that different from each other, is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play. 
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions, of course. 
That's not true at all. 
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me. 
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on. 
I get a sense of anticipation"? 
(Laughter) To conclude, then: We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. 
And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well, then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car, and it would cost a lot more to make, because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. 
I was spending all my time practicing. 
It's important that, if our feelings match reality, we make better security trade-offs. 
This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic. 
And what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean. 
This era's mom, Bree Van de Kamp. 
It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well, but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think, to the design of prosthetics, soft robots, basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important. 
That means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved, and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will. 
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture, but they're relevant to the design of anything. 
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist. 
And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders, and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith, and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists across the world. 
So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy." 
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it. 
Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh. 
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue. 
And he put that in the word "arete," which we, from the [Ancient Greek], translate as "virtue."

This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around 2,000 years old. 
We had this small NGO, Transparency International. 
And there was a rock that I always missed. 
Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves, and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math. 
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well. 
The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period. 
I'm betting my career on this. 
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar. 
She marched into the oil field reserves, surrounded it, without firing a shot, and secured it and held it. 
If you think that 25 million people are infected, if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high, maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million. 
So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile, 500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago. 
(Applause) Thank you. I have two missions here today. 
So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into 16 pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. 
And there will be no mistakes." 
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians. 
(Laughter) (Applause) The children enthusiastically got after me and said, "Now, what do you want us to do?" 
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass. 
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. 
Even if, when you're in your car and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! -- 85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting -- I know you've had this experience -- that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere." 
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now, all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing, the doodles in the margins. 
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest. 
Pole caught -- no bycatch. 
But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick." 
Very different notion. 
So, social production is a real fact, not a fad. 
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. 
So a person can be in a long term attachment, become romantically infatuated with someone else, and want to have sex with a third person. 
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention. 
And the large companies, they typically have wonderful wellness programs, but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this, they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. 
Congrats, guys. (Laughs) But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks" and "My So-Called Life," and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. 
A few energy geeks spread out across the room. 
You have not changed the story. 
There are still some blue whales. 
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. 
So I want to see how things work and what's happening. 
I'm just going back and forth; I'm not getting anywhere. 
In his own reported words, he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn't have been real. 
We all go back so far, and in this present moment, on this day, all the people you meet, all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink. 
And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government, through NIH and National Science -- NSF -- and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. 
No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident. 
This is done by children without the help of any teacher. 
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.

I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving. 
Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants, which may, if their populations get too large, have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. 
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk." 
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. 
I do not use them as weapons. 
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. 
In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. 
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this: The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back, and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do, you will always tend to postpone and postpone, and eventually it gets too late. 
That was challenging. 
So that was a factor-100 saving. 
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars, photographed by Emory Kristof. 
These guys make money. 
Well, they were out, but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers. 
But, one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system. 
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients. 
Two men, Rahul and Rajiv, living in the same neighborhood, from the same educational background, similar occupation, and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain. 
This signaled the start of agriculture. 
Over the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more, is going to save a lot more lives. 
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life. 
The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage." 
If you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory. 
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage, who, working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up with a bike out of thin air. 
And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. 
Black people are just as happy as white people are. 
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up. 
But that may not be all that's going on. 
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel, get their message from above. 
They want to have the discipline and accountability. 
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. 
From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. 
They all need a face. 
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. 
So I'd like to show you a few examples, because there are many possible applications for this new interface. 
But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too. 
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much. 
Because perception leads to your response to it. 
The theme next year is re-birth. 
Somebody from India would know, of course. 
And it is really fun to say. 
By 2007, the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. 
Therefore, 99 percent of people are organ donors. 
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you didn't think of India as a market, you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter. 
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change. 
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds. 
But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. 
I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether. 
And as a final parting thought, on behalf of future archeologists, I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth. 
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle. 
They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors. 
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her. 
I remember when I was 19, I did, I wanted to do my first art exhibition, and I wanted the whole world to know about it. 
And we can predict what the sound will be. 
It's 1964, and we're back at Bell Labs. 
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches -- as I did for a year and a half -- is that you walk slower. 
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. 
(Video): So it's day 22. 
But nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. 
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs. 
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world. 
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang. 
I went to prison -- difficult. 
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations. 
But what this image represents was the problem. 
And as adults, we're certainly not alone. 
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. 
And the way we've done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids. 
BA: It's interesting. 
But it was testably stupid. 
Well, but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. 
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that's hard. 
And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God. 
But for us, the rain is good. 
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?

And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. 
And yet another moon there -- I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere. 
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years. 
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book, is it's fundamentally making a promise. 
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal. 
But instead of saying, we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded, Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos. 
You know, they might have a solution. 
It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. 
Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?" 
(Laughter) But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle, which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners. 
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project. 
The countries which have many babies per woman here, they have quite low income. 
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.

So you are, in fact, a chord -- each of you an individual chord. 
We invest in more emotionally important parts of life, and life gets better, so we're happier day-to-day. 
(Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. 
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness. 
Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style, I might as well call the real guy and ask him, and I sent him my books, and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium. 
That's the twelfth one. 
Very quickly they told me, "Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease. 
Well in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. 
But in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record, it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods -- I call this the "slow hunch." 
And of course, we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars. 
And when you see this kind of behavior, what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict, algorithms locked in loops with each other, without any human oversight, without any adult supervision to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty." 
She has been in exile for the last year and a half. 
Bright yellow. 
In every case, they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. 
And these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case, on the Washington Post -- from the content on the site. 
It's a dream. And it became a dream also. 
Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. 
I mean, who are these people? 
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster. 
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. 
(Applause) It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey, to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me. 
I was also interested in the physicality of this format, because you have to walk to see it. 
MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943. 
That's stage two. 
You type in your code, but you first test your mic. 
It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. 
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. 
You could even get your own hive if you want. 
It brought much, much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. 
So what it is, is these four: Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work, women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. 
Let us make this field a much bigger place. 
You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. 
Are there any general conclusions that arise? 
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work, during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant. 
Because you can't. 
(Laughter) There's a whole programming language and robotics tool, so if you want to teach someone how to program, kid, adult, whatever it is. 
And then, in 20 minutes, the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens. 
And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. 
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. 
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. 
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.

Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. 
That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt. 
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes. 
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, which is what you see Romo doing on the left. 
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. 
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout. 
This process requires extraordinary precautions. 
And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. 
And so, you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ... 
It's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women, most of whom are HIV-positive. 
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? 
The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. 
You can get it out. 
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder. 
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up. 
Rule number two: Embrace the mess. 
I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country. 
I decided to have a child, and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong. 
That's not one of us." 
(Knocks) And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire? 
Here, the ice seems a living presence. 
He's building this huge concrete place. 
Alex, in some ways, said it best. 
It's very painful, even though it doesn't mean anything. 
And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole, there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves, are they motivated? 
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary." 
You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. 
Twenty years back, when there was a report on bank computerization, they didn't name the report as a report on computers, they call them as "ledger posting machines." 
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us. 
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. 
But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping. 
There's a billion people without clean drinking water. 
(Applause) If nothing else, at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through: sweaty palms, sleepless nights, a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. 
So you can log in through the browser, and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. 
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it, so we repeatedly measure various genes of the 25,000 genes in the genome. 
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. 
It was incredible. 
And this immediately cheers him up, as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. 
and bingo. That is all you have to do. 
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. 
Taking tests is stressful, but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop bullets from bursting. 
Number one, this matters because this represents more than a billion people. 
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. 
We think in terms of war and interstate war. 
We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities, in a certain sense.

I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. 
So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea, we finally can now see that they are really, at the end of the day, one idea. 
But this is no laughing matter. 
Almost immediately, though, people ask, "How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?" 
Obama had to issue a press release. 
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem. 
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost. 
So, how did the city respond? 
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell, but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first. 
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer. 
(Laughter) Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew. 
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. 
We went in there thinking, "We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us. 
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off, or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit. 
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. 
Currently, the new narrative about Braddock, a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization, is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier. 
In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. 
What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?" 
Multinationals are protecting human rights. 
You will never be as young as you are right now. 
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. 
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand, because this man knows how insensitive our government is. 
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you, and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top. 
The attention to this detail astonished me, and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment, from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated. 
And he works this system. 
You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri after a tornado, he regains that. 
And we just count on down to the bottom. 
I can't change the condition of the road, but I can make the cycle run faster. 
Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission -- what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. 
It's very consolidated, and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. 
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. 
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing. 
There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. 
And as you know, or as you may not know, this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world. 
Now, this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. 
That's another story we won't even get into. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, personally, I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis, but I'll leave this to your good judgment. 
(Applause) You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins. 
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. 
At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination -- a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps, or his own mind working against him. 
You nearly fall with one leg, then you catch yourself with the other. 
We should take our inspiration from biology. 
So first, the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting. 
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today, the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. 
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich." 
What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine? 
And it's very, very hard to get information from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. 
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set, or any passerby. So, safety is everything. 
And we did find a lot of stuff. 
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot: there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki. 
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued. 
And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor. 
So I took this picture three days after she arrived, and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on, with her toes sticking out. 
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms. 
(Applause) It comes online this summer, and it begins its journey of exploration. 
For example, it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions. 
It's trying to recover. 
What happened to the Neanderthals? 
I really mean life on Earth, past and present, from microbes to us humans, in its rich molecular diversity, the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that, collectively, biochemistry, life as a chemical process, as a chemical phenomenon. 
And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people. 
So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. 
So for example, we are overconfidence machines. 
But I'm here today to give you a choice. 
Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. 
You can see from the slide, very very strong. 
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. 
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles. 
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist, suggests a person -- say, one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere? 
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. 
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. 
Now, there's a funny thing going on here. 
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy, in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe, where time itself seems to stand still. 
The next thing is sodium chloride. 
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line. 
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. 
I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health. 
When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. 
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. 
And let me be blunt about this. 
Only in this way, in the future, we will achieve the dreams of the mouse: that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear. 
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. 
Very good, mother. Move ahead. 
And we see it all over the place as well now. 
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years. 
The best stories infuse wonder. 
(Laughter) And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought, like I'm speaking to you now, right, but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions, because the more I got to know him and his system, the more exciting this whole idea became. 
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me." 
And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years. 
And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming. 
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. 
They want to be missed. 
They're playing out Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan. 
We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator. 
And you know, some of my friends have always said, "Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this? 
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. 
And if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except, when they did it first, it would have been done in Texas. 
What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. 
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. 
They must have done better, in terms of economic growth. 
Thank you. 
They are both right now on the run. 
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience. 
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. 
The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C. 
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school, a military takeover happened in my country, a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope, and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest. 
And it was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting, and she was very much onstage, and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. 
So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer. 
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. 
What should be at the bottom of the list? 
The next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40? 
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting. 
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now, an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim. 
And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. 
In countless accidents, the driver says, "I didn't see it coming." 
You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. 
What happened to me might have been catastrophic, if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. 
And finally, an acronym. 
So then you really get into it, and you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this software to let you build your own virtually." 
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this, there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004, and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun. 
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names, although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter) But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this, take a picture, say, of this guy right here, get the name, and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody, because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. 
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. 
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount. 
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school will be able to have one in 2015. 
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. 
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. 
But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe, but at the computational universe. 
Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds, and it can be switched off at very high speeds. 
And now down to another part of the world. 
These are the benefits to play. 
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance. 
Well, there were a couple of reasons. 
I don't know where we are now. 
I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. 
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. 
Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. 
I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back. 
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets. 
Not a challenging task. 
We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time. 
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex. 
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows. 
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested. 
It's my way of helping other victims, and it's my final request of you. 
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. 
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. 
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America, growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street, the most migrant community in America. 
(Laughter) So I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first. 
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house. 
And the things that they build amaze even themselves. 
So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom, which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you have stored about me. 
He's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career. 
And one of the the cutting-edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. 
But in America, I didn't know what to do, because I had this overwhelming freedom. 
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal. 
Probably a form of synesthesia. 
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name to say, "I exist." 
And Jeff's advice was, "Be a traveller, not a tourist. 
Make it go in the other direction. 
But in fact, when you give something to someone and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go, that's one thing. 
They defer the payments. 
This is me: 60-plus. 
You may have seen this in other forms, but the top line is the amount of protected area on land, globally, and it's about 12 percent. 
(Laughter) There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there? 
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel. 
Some of the islands have already gone under water. 
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling. 
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top. 
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. 
Just go on, go on in your room. 
It increases our openness to change. 
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment. 
If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy. 
And I think I was 14. 
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved. 
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing. 
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice. 
So one squared is one, two squared is four, three squared is nine, five squared is 25, and so on. 
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously? 
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture, even our cities. 
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways. 
But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins. 
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. 
You want a dirty magazine? 
What do I wear? 
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. 
We think, by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language, and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social, emotional and cognitive development. 
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, that recycle much of their water, that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. 
This picture shows a revolution started by women, and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest. 
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card. 
As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. 
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. 
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. 
So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better 25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today. 
So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work, then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete, working, general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software, from the ground up, from first principles. 
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths. 
Now, when you talk global you have to talk English. 
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"? 
And he'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace. 
This is a player-developed, self-enforcing, voluntary currency, and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior. 
So let's get started now. 
It is not a map. 
It's like hurry, build your instruments. 
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence, and when the patient came for the physical, I was able to do a thorough physical, because I had nothing else to do. 
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues than you might have injured in your knee, or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60. 
Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there? 
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists. 
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do. 
(Laughter) But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg. 
Because they evolved for the same reason: to survive predation. 
(Applause) So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks. 
You can see every step I take. 
Here is what happens. 
that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. 
Go out and look like a diplomat." 
Or do I smell some doubt in the room? 
There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. 
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. 
And this is how it looked six years ago. 
That record exists on Mars. 
And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required. 
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity, this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring. 
So, for instance, I may Twitter right now that I'm giving a talk at TED. 
And ecologically, it was a disaster. 
So why? 
After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000, that displaced 1.3 million people, that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. 
Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really, really freaking bad. 
The first surgery was a great success. 
For a hungry child, politics and freedom are not even thought of. 
We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on, they recover their developmental delays, and go on to lead normal, happy lives. 
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. 
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us, there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year for power that, generally speaking, is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power. 
Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos -- we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. 
On the contrary, doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high. 
The electrons go to work in the real world out here, powering our devices. 
This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it. 
My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer. 
And suddenly all these tiny, little worlds, they come together in this complex web. 
She said, "That's Wei. 
SB: Thank you. 
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton: promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product launches, territorial expansion. 
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table, and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?" 
They export water molecules through, and leave solutes on the other side. 
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. 
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside, hold it until you need it, and then be able to release it and pass it off. 
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. 
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people in Europe and in China. 
And so I asked Jawad, "How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community. 
Some of you might recognize this as the '60s. 
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher. 
It totally dominated her imagination for months. 
They don't. Nobody knows what it is. 
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money? 
It's kind of like genomics. 
These membranes are also quite similar, morphologically and functionally, to the membranes in your body, and we can use these, as they say, to form the body of our protocell. 
The MTA will confiscate your camera." 
These technologies want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us. 
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17. 
And everything began pretty auspiciously. 
He was delighted. 
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media, thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world, tribes are everywhere. 
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us. 
Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have. 
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires. 
In the 18th century, it became a verb, and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. 
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects, and the system projects down the laser beam path. 
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better. 
We've tested and polished the first mirror. 
That's the police, getting rid of it all. 
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff. 
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters. 
And this is an important lesson, because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. 
He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea. 
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off. 
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech. 
Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer. 
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. 
You know, this is one of my favorite devices. 
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it. 
Door-to-door travel time is reduced, because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space, taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger, you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go. 
Would you get any population-level immunity? 
And what must that feel like? 
Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. 
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated, and he vents his frustrations. 
I look out the window, and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window, framed in that window, wherever we are, I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth. 
I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker-basket chest to me. 
It's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block. 
It's not his money, of course. 
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans. 
This is Inside Out. 
So what I did is, I took all this research and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig, and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. 
I started commuting to Kobe, and I met the society of Vietnamese people. 
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again. 
(Laughter) And of course, who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
That begins my translation process. 
And I can't decide. 
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard. 
But the more I talked about it, the more objectified and fragmented my body became. 
And as I said earlier, China has not passed the United States. 
And one evening, I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul, and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. 
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them. 
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram. 
CA: Just kidding. 
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain, telling the brain continually, "Where am I now within my environment?" 
Are you ready? You look a little nervous. 
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience, are now used to this change. 
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence. 
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong. 
If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex, the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn. 
Like a bribe buster service, or 1-800-Fight-Bribes, or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. 
Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket. 
Now I've been talking a lot about magic. 
I stopped giving it so much authority. 
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. 
It's actually pretty busy. 
Where is the Small Hadron Collider? 
And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. 
But anyway, the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was -- there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. 
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. 
You're just one of the people who hasn't been told. 
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. 
And something else happened, these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives. 
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501? 
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker, because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against. 
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form, until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. 
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones. 
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about. 
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. 
Now sometimes when people see this, I hear this gasp. 
We're similar at the genetic level. 
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled." 
And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves, which was as people who helped patients, they didn't harm them. 
And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 
(Applause) The big residual is always value for money. 
For example, the happy wife. 
What are the virtues, the aspirations that you're actually expressing in that? 
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. 
I'm coming out. 
But on the web, all three dials are ratcheted right up. 
That's right. 
We were the best and the brightest. 
Well, I'm glad you can. 
It's not saying that global warming is not happening. 
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. 
(Laughter) What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question. 
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do. 
Here are two organisms that pull water. 
So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve, elevate, the terms of political discourse in the United States, and for that matter, around the world. 
And it's a game you play with other people. 
But you don't cross it once. 
I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts, you will realize, of course I have to worry. 
And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. 
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. 
I'm not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy, although I think that would also be completely awesome. 
But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes. 
His village is near Mogadishu. 
At the same time, we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world. 
And we have taken pictures like this. 
I'll ask the technicians to start the music. 
But as you can see, when I talk, I speak with an American accent, which you would think as an Iranian-American actor, I should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you. 
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. 
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause. 
And in fact, we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this]. 
To just bring them to justice." 
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a 401(k) plan before they see it, before they can touch it. 
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. 
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim. 
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? 
And when you've got interest, then you have education. 
That climate plays no role. 
And she died quietly in her favorite place. 
AO: Who is this? 
An incredible conversation sprung up there. 
The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story, a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation. 
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health. 
But to a fashionista, what it really is is a sign of Prada's genius: that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota, and to be current and to be now. 
(Applause) Number seven: particle accelerator mishap. 
And nobody knows just why this was so, but one story can reflect something of it. 
(Laughter) And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God, so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust." 
And where your eye isn't looking, you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. 
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here? 
The parents predicted the kids would say, spending more time with them. 
This one was from Haiti. 
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years, or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there? 
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii. 
There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo. 
That's kind of profound, in a way. 
So we also face risks. 
And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, "All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?" 
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" -- probably that's also a good choice. 
It's 1876, it's in Boston, and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. 
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature. 
All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally, I think, has failed. 
(Applause) So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. 
And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work, exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong. 
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody. 
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. 
And inside those balls life, over 3.8 billion years, has made a lush, livable place for us. 
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. 
So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment. 
It's actually strength -- it's power. 
Here it's "CandyCity." 
We can also test where we think objects are, like this goal flag, in simple environments -- or indeed, where your car would be. 
and horizontally, the amount of digital information available. 
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin. 
Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. 
People have to make a living. 
You know, the 9/11 cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. 
One of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy. 
It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains, but we certainly can begin to approach the question, and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. 
And you have to go further down. 
As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. 
You see, if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troubling, but also very helpful, insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. 
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here." 
This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis. 
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish. 
We stood up, we walked out. 
They give you 48 hours to finish this race. 
(Laughter) The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea? 
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian. 
Another thing is, it turns out, those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect -- banks, venture capitalists, other organizations and support structures -- they come from friends and family. 
What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. 
I was so upset. 
So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it. 
So we had this speaker set up, and we had the camera facing it, and lots of lights pointing at the speaker, and I would set up the speaker, put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker, and we would do this over and over again, and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker. 
He goes in there, and it's not there. 
He was a troubled kid. 
(Laughter) The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break. 
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be. 
In a world with no systems, with chaos, everything becomes a guerilla struggle, and this predictability is not there. 
In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. 
So she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage." 
You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish. 
But at the time when I started this project, the best explanation I could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues, and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila! it became erect. 
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. 
You can see the atrium and the ventricles, how blood flows to our arteries and veins. 
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash, what they can initiate and sustain. 
Now it's 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality. 
I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand, and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. 
Well, to this, I just say, no no. 
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition. 
So what could this mean? 
So, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. 
(Laughter) I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. 
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives. 
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago. 
Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'" "I could say that, but what if I were to say, 'Hello. I'm your doctor?'" They go, "Great. And then you hijack the hospital." 
So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit. 
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty. 
And they're the same ones that I have today. 
A function is attributed to fiction. 
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.) (Applause) I live in South Central. 
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do. 
And because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time, you can transform these differences to estimates of time, where the two humans, typically, will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago, and with the chimpanzees, it will be in the order of five million years ago. 
Man 4: You ready? You ready? (Barking) Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture. 
I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him. 
There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. 
Should we have a national research program that looks at this? 
Green chemistry is chemistry in water. 
One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. 
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut. 
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?" 
In a nuclear power plant, you have a big pot of water that's under high pressure, and you have some fuel rods, and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium, and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel, and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level, and that reaction heats up water, the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine, and you produce electricity from it. 
But there's a vaccine for that too. 
So here is one example of how you approach it. 
And just a father and son trying to survive, walking along the road. 
If we can change the dynamic, by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... 
So thank you very much. 
Now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn, wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century -- spent the bulk of his life in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra. 
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk. 
Since 1989, the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years. 
I think it might be a lifeline. 
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
Bias can be about race, it can be about gender. 
What we need is a players' uprising. 
So, we came up with multiple hypotheses: there's little green people down there taking it; there's all sorts of things going on. 
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. 
That's a stunning vision. 
We took our clues from mother nature. 
We can go do it over and over again. 
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007. 
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. 
But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. 
One in four, maximum. 
As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. 
for me, it's ocean acidification. 
I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time, and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. 
We then process these husks with some basic equipment. 
They can't be 10 miles behind. 
It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo chambers. 
What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact, or a known fact, about social networks, which goes like this: Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do? 
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us. 
And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp. 
For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour, both of us will need an assistive device called a car. 
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the human population -- it's something we should be aware of. 
Instead, when you speak, you're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television. 
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. 
OK, we have to ask for raw data now. 
There were blood vessels left. 
And what goes on in the future? 
I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?" 
So my coauthors and I have used computers, the greatest tool of our time, to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. 
This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long, and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime. 
There are different types of waste. 
Here are two different jewelry displays. 
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. 
It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year, a business worth almost two billion dollars. 
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction. 
Take a square one there, first. 
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector. 
But in fact, here in the northwest, we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise, defined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams." 
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. 
We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration. 
The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. 
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly, we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. 
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. 
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal. 
Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution. 
And there's more and more people on the way. Right? 
If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners, it's a war crime." 
Trade has increased. 
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that. 
Brainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. 
In Liberia, for example, the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls. 
Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework, the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse, the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation, which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron. 
Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. 
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. 
And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. 
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. 
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. 
And he controls them from the top down -- whereas when they work for the other side, eventually, when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated, they actually, each one has a different, colorful kind of dress. 
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story. 
For example, anything you want to post, like "get together" or "meet up" or "walk," it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. 
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day. 
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos. 
So this was one particular problem they talked about, that it might be used indiscriminately. 
And you know what happened. 
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family, and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law, her intestine suddenly strangled one day, and we took her to the emergency room, and she was, she was in really bad shape. 
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines. 
And this was another killer app -- the very opposite of a killer, because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy. 
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. 
So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws -- how were we killing these animals? Mystery number one. 
And then he added, "But our water has no impurities." 
Well I will show you here. 
And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living: this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living." 
In fact, these guys actually work for NASA, and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components, cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. 
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. 
Again, what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. 
But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. 
If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy. 
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world, and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion. 
I made a booking, and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport, all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls. (Laughter) I can tell you, I did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot's license. (Laughter) I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand. 
How are we going to issue driver's licenses? 
So I was thinking about my own life, and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also — (Laughter) — the lives of my friends, but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter) So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. 
With enough users, maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action, containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. 
So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? 
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times. 
Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist, working with the bugs at UCL in London, trying to solidify them. 
These are the kids who now, one semester in, I can put something on the board, totally new, totally foreign, and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year, which is just so fun. 
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. 
So then here's the final ranking. 
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this? 
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years. 
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Drucker says: "Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy." 
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil, how we scale up this model in China and Brazil. 
(Applause) I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana, West Africa. 
A lot of places are working with their local schools. 
We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. 
"What should you not be? 
And what did the Norden bombsight do? 
What frightens you?" 
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. 
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet. 
And so what did we find? 
This is what it looked like for three months. 
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science. 
And if they do so, then, of course, the conditions improve, and they start riding on scooters. 
Extremism became tolerance. 
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing. 
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual. 
And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand. 
Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"? 
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things, but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. 
That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering. 
And then the third thing would be, please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16-year-old girls, because I would want to know where this language had developed since our times, and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses. 
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. 
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. 
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. 
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water. 
And this gap really narrows. 
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, "Success," when they gain access to services like this. 
I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran -- an informed one, an experienced one even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book. 
I don't think so -- quite the opposite. 
And that was a personal belief, regardless of what's going on, regardless of the details. 
But I recognize -- (Applause) I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science. 
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant, and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture. 
My mother died in [a] gynecology complication, so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. 
We kicked his bed so that he could see out. 
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? 
In case you're finished with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter) So it's very useful. 
You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. 
(Laughter) So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this, plus "Psycho." 
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do, I think, but not too many. 
But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases. 
(Singing) And some younger members. 
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. 
And in the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work. 
And, oh yes, if you wanted, he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it. 
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months. 
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation. 
We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. 
It's October of 1957, and Sputnik has just launched, and we're in Laurel Maryland, at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. 
Now, put it this way: What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage? 
And if you think about it, it's the history of industrial agriculture. 
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money, I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc., so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge. 
But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge, vast ocean? 
And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. 
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy. 
But it's a kind of indirect argument. 
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen. 
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap. 
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. 
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you? 
Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life." 
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend. 
And this is art. This is metaphor. 
Here somebody makes a right turn, and in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us, and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely. 
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control. 
They taught me how to look and see, and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child, "Of all these things we already make you, which do you like best?" -- which gives you zero answers that are usable. 
Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you. 
I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education, which brought together top acousticians, government people, teachers, and so forth. 
But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. 
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history. 
(Applause) "Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up." 
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier. 
So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities? 
Computer: ♫ Memory, thump. ♫ CL: ♫ Thump of the beat in a known repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete ♫ ♫ The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed ♫ ♫ Psychopathic words in my head appear ♫ ♫ Whisper these lyrics only I can hear ♫ ♫ The art of discovering and that which is hovering ♫ ♫ Inside the mind of those unconfined ♫ 
Well there's a little bit more to it than that. 
But less than 24 hours, I was 13 miles away from those mosques, visiting one of our Acumen investees, an incredible man, Jawad Aslam, who dares to live a life of immersion. 
It's fairly simple. 
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. 
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit. 
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in, because if there's one thing that I've come to realize, if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem, it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others. 
You’re either playful or you’re serious, and you can’t be both. 
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms -- the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival. 
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments? 
Obviously, you've got a computer now. 
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth. Right? 
What can we do in a case like Chandler's? 
But before we can make life, let's think for a second what life really is characterized by. 
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind. 
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent. 
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children, the best way to have a new lease on life, is to have a child. 
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. 
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. 
And if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th -- you're going to see a few cases light up. 
So how do we develop the skills that we need? 
For the last 40 years, I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old, aged, authoritarian, corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us. 
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. 
(Applause) Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories, but you're really writing about the exceptions." 
(Applause) Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate. 
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water. 
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. 
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected. 
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding, but what they do is, they take a light bulb and they smash it. 
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. 
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. 
And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared, have gone missing in action. 
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer. 
And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside. 
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors. 
At 13, with only little English and being bullied at school, he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability, but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet. 
So our work, in a certain way, is to address this imago, this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. 
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well, and put a Twitter feed on the front page, and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well. 
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing. 
And what we found is very exciting. 
Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws, evade taxes, evade environmental or labor standards. 
And you know, it had this fragrant softness, and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil. 
They trust their ears. 
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. 
So, this is a frequent theme: societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. 
There's not very much left in the world. 
And if they nominate the party host as their friend, that party host has a hundred friends, therefore, has more friends than they do. 
Now the problem with all of this, getting older, is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide. 
I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then. 
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from. 
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. 
Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith, but absolute, heartless conviction. 
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock? 
It goes out to a really long distance, compared to any of these other sorts of things. 
Or do you really want to hurt me personally? 
after their peak, they collapse. For example, the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest. 
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter) And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe that people can see into the future. 
In 1999, two and a half years into that job, something happened. 
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe; it's cold, hard science. 
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. 
And this is about shifting baseline. 
Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water. 
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution, not the problem. 
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity], Ten percent in fact, on both of those. 
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful, to be healthy, and to have a successful life. 
This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais. 
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives. 
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean? 
I remember, I was telling one of the guys, "Hey, mate, look, I really want to learn how to surf." 
(Applause) Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. 
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- (Feedback) All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- (Laughter) -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. 
It still ends up at half a turn. 
And you'll see why 1984 won't be like "1984." 
Then there's ultraviolet light. 
So it angered the Chinese Netizens. 
I rewrote that story, and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen -- and here's a side note: if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well. 
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency; it's getting physical. 
(Laughter) So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken. 
So even though it's a global company, they take a very local approach. 
Went to the roof, and all the women said, "Clear out. 
So, we started Parikrma. 
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic. 
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with, and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response. 
It's better if you care about learning something. 
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? 
We stop ourselves from doing things. 
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy. 
Isn't it amazing? 
We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams, and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam. 
It goes up by 15 percent, and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure. 
That's something different from the system that is the pleasure system, which simply says, "I like this." 
Never mind. I won't get into that. 
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. 
In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. 
Which would you like, if you could have just one? 
The great news is we already know what works. 
But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. 
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. 
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition. 
The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc. 
All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring, and then you can fire at me. 
Other ones have a focus on health care, tourism, engineering and other fields. 
My main message is, if we can redefine apathy, not as some kind of internal syndrome, but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement, and if we can clearly define, we can clearly identify, what those obstacles are, and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles, then anything is possible. 
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba. 
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn, followed by a third of a turn, the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. 
You start to get into detail. 
Boy: What's making this light up. 
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later, like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time, and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase in the speed is constant. 
Still, some boundaries are larger than others. 
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle? 
I was born in Algeria. 
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. 
You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist -- somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid. 
Believing in each other, really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world, that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. 
She's 16 years old. 
She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care. 
So even if you don't know anything about this book, you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence. 
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. 
Together, this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. 
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that? 
How would we finance this? 
Being close to the content -- that's the content really is close to my heart. 
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again. 
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery. 
Now we'll explain that in a second. 
And we discovered that it's a very good thing that, when you go home with something that's been broken, you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through. 
Adhesives were replacing the rivets. 
And let me tell you, these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. 
That's the biggest design challenge. 
Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think because I altered the map of New York, if you notice. 
And the geese love the Lupin bush. 
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women, which is spread by a virus, and to the AIDS epidemic, which is associated with a number of different types of cancer. 
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. 
(Applause) I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. 
And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. 
This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. 
So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have, at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. 
In short, what all of us do. 
That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture. 
It's also objectionable on a second ground. 
Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. 
Well, just imagine a world, for the moment, divided into two camps. 
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game. 
We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive, and I spend a lot of time being those things too. 
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole. 
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts. 
They did it by draining the land. 
And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?" 
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. 
The middle class is spending more on schooling too, but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT, the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent. 
Heart disease kills people, often very quickly. 
You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. 
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass, which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. 
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I'm not going to go near it, thank you. 
They're designed to recover from an injury. 
And [the] U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. 
We need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less-trained individuals. 
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working. 
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place. 
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them, so they pick up these kinds of activities. 
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. 
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas. 
It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists known as Crusaders: "infidel," from the Latin for "faithless." 
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average. 
What you really want -- what I really want, is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this. 
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there. 
The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent." 
If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. 
And what that means: "simple and understandable" might not be actually simple or understandable, and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable. 
We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. 
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. 
With nuclear, those who know the most are the least worried. 
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. 
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers -- buried in the hills somewhere in North America -- massive versions of these same symbols. 
What if, instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal, we started with what the tissues are made of, the basic unit of life, the cell? 
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said, "Why [do] women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent and, you know, supportive? 
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming. 
(Laughter) But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. 
And third, can China do without killer app number three? 
It's not. 
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it, because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. 
We are not talking about 50,000 dollars here, or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there. 
And we luckily have an opportunity for you. 
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. 
Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. 
So there has been a lot of change. 
He built a system. 
We also have things about how to make the bun. 
We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy. 
And Kiva.org, the microlender, is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. 
He was being raised by his grandmother. 
They would bring prosperity, security, overcome sectarian violence, ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists. 
We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case, we have carrot cake. 
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here. 
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. 
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. 
You, yourself, will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother, your child -- there are heads nodding, people who say, "Yes, I know exactly what you mean." 
It's sort of a funny pattern. 
Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list." 
It's basically a measure of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. 
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment, done by faith and guess alone. 
And we do a lot of work here. 
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men. 
So, one day, cattle in a pen. 
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy. 
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed." 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause) Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play. 
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. 
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s. 
And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West only for now. 
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing. 
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy, grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. 
If you have an idea, send it back to us." 
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development, if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society. 
So could art change the world? 
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away. 
But actually, the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that. 
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show. 
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. 
A bit of cloning, you can get them back. 
We have superstar technologists. 
Let's be under no illusions. 
You'll been engulfed by a red giant." 
And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. 
The children looked at it and said, "What?" 
We've operated over 400 of these, perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries -- not just magnesium and antimony. 
So, in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances. 
It makes them meet. 
We all have an African origin. 
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of some evil supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Whoa. 
So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to, and that is: how could you have done it? 
So that their decisions are based on past memories. 
And this is the mimic. 
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it. 
If you're so virtuous, show me the money. 
But it's not the same stuff; it's different. 
This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. 
I'm not here alone. 
They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about, all right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape? They are. 
To date, with the help of a global network of partners, we've completed close to fifty projects. 
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad -- (Laughter) Karolina and Karl, and grandmom and granddad, Josefine and Josef. 
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. 
Here's something where we're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here. 
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective, and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. 
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School, which is a school that we had worked with on some other things, and we gave that assignment to the students. 
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was. 
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero, who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters. 
Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence, up until the 1970s or so, the benefits, social and physical and political and mental, could be astounding. 
I remember sometime during the '80s, the mid-'80s, Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy's house -- up in San Francisco for dinner. 
First was Autonomy. 
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. 
Is that a big number? 
This is why we have to solve our problems, and I know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature, the stuff of life: the simple electron. 
There's various types of frustration. 
We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. 
Oh, my God! 
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. 
And this probably is not what you're expecting. 
And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium. 
Really cool term: neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. 
And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom. 
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass. 
(Applause) Until then, until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. 
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon, the little black dots are people. 
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq. 
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. 
And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company, you can see that written up in this week's edition of PLOS Medicine. 
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations. 
The cybertopians say, much like fax machines and Xerox machines did in the '80s, blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest, so people would inevitably rebel. 
It's absolutely transformative. 
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? 
And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place, which is ways the world could end very suddenly. 
But the self is a projection based on other people's projections. 
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. 
They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. 
You need a pressure suit. 
So you've effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research. 
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. 
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible. 
The problem with it is -- and the reason I will never build another one like it -- is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking. 
And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bottles, most of it is only down-cycled, or incinerated, or shipped to China. 
But they weren't given that choice, because their own citizens beat them to the punch. 
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath, they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. 
Here is just some data. This is China. 
So unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums, for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart, every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation, we say, "Do we really need that test?" 
Put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well. 
And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps, as young mothers, to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women. 
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one. 
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter. 
You charge another inmate to clean his cell. 
One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day, he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?" 
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. 
Why is it that X is the unknown? 
Somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "Oops." 
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like "greed." 
And it's actually quite a useful concept, because it tells us not only when a black hole will form, but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. 
It's like the essence of TED. 
It's a really big problem. 
And he thought, "What if we do this?" 
Here, what's spreading from person to person is not a behavior, but rather a norm: An idea is spreading. 
And the size of the bubble is the population. 
I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption, one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. 
But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral. 
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"? 
And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed. 
When you're standing in a trench all alone, if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed. 
I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. 
And people are looking like this ... 
And if you're squeamish, please look away now. 
That is a wonderful thing. 
I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so: we are right in the middle, and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. 
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience: If civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular, governments, governments and their international institutions, but also large international actors, in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society, government and private sector, there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world. 
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements, or it could be our worst. 
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks, which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks. 
Fair enough question. 
In other words, I look for aliens, and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. 
This is what it looks like today. 
"She took up a more threatening position in her bed." 
And we use that as a moral tickle. 
Fit into this other system and try to become a student." 
And we're stepping it up. 
I looked up. 
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on. 
We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top. 
And you know what I've learned? 
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread, which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. 
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that. 
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room. 
Okay, so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. 
I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein, to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine, and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title, "Can This Planner Save Detroit?" 
What are the emotions that can be measured? 
We call it the Water Canary. 
As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly, which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ... 
Is it something about the light? 
But we began with the idea of one child at a time. 
Two years later, she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer. 
How could you have a problem like this? 
It's extremely lumpy. 
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there -- both projecting a different image of Yemeni women, but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal danger? 
This was very important, because the family is central in Afghans' social system. 
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade. 
Now, modern slavery: according to State Department rough statistics, there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders. 
What are the values you're using to judge those? 
No one has to green-light your idea. 
You just need a few people -- (Laughter) -- who will look at the rules, realize they make no sense, and realize how much they want to be connected. 
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history. 
But some plants are manipulating animals, like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. 
I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?" 
True navigation begins in the human heart. 
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained. 
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. 
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. 
There are people now online that are friends; they've never met. 
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone. 
And so what does that mean? 
And in the Egyptian revolution, the Revolution 2.0, everyone has contributed something, small or big. They contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. 
And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. 
So they send them back in recent years. 
We found it was moving in really weird ways. 
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins." 
No one wants it. 
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season. 
The date here is November 11, 1980. 
It's really hard to get copyright for databases. 
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. 
I can see it in their eyes. 
You work by learning, and you learn by working. 
So the technique, it's cut, sandblasted, etched and printed glass into architectural glass. 
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy, when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model. 
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea? 
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. 
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips. 
He was like, "Be careful going down this path. 
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems. 
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold." 
Helps us do our jobs better, and helps us feel better when we do them. 
And as we assemble these tools, from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it, because these are things, as we've already said, they're arriving at the brain, it would seem, before cognition, before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks. 
There were no clouds in the sky. 
If we can have this document up ... 
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige. 
And they come up one at a time, and then I think, "OK, well maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm," and I can hold it there and turn them into videos. 
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology. 
We were the first film crew in there. 
And then they played around with it a little bit more, and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties. 
(Laughter) And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula, and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. 
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. 
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. 
It's such a small thing, right? 
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly. 
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student. 
But ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption. 
It would be very dangerous if you fell down. 
And we ended up with 10 statements. 
And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean." 
Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. 
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure -- but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate? 
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago, I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist, and the first thing I thought about was, if these neurons are electrical devices, all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. 
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign, which is what you do in polio. 
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way. 
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears, to have a very honest conversation. 
In the case, in the lower court, they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue. 
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. 
This means that the robot is inherently unstable. 
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. 
Recording: Okay, here's something. 
(Laughter) "I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens. 
(Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. 
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing. 
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins, for example, or maybe an entire bone. 
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up. 
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah." 
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children. 
Now, here's the bad news. 
We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. 
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. 
And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority, have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority. 
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. 
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking? 
We own all of that blue and yet, like I say, particularly the western territorial trust, we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them. 
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well. 
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing. 
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call, somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called. 
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete. 
And I believe that. I believe that. 
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you. 
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes. 
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood, asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans. 
Not exclusive to these things, but in addition to them, is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground. 
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked. 
If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference. 
They believe that things can be done. 
Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong. 
(Music) So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music. 
If you look at declassified cables, that's the sort of material that's there. 
And it opens up a map. 
Those two countries aren't getting along these days. 
Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap, billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them. 
Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk. 
The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency. 
(Laughter) So like Johnny Depp, and like 25 percent of Americans between the ages of 16 and 50, I have a tattoo. 
We banned those chemicals, and we replaced them, unknowingly, with other substances that, molecule per molecule, are a hundred times more potent as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. 
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. 
Now David is my literary agent. 
Didn't read anything. "There it is." 
Some journeyed to the moons and planets. 
Silence is beautiful. 
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. 
Privacy is not up for discussion. 
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones. 
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti. 
We've got to make something better than what we've got. 
Actually, these stories compelled me around the world, and I've been to over 60 countries. 
It has just that sensor in it. 
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia, and there is nothing there. 
(Applause) These artifacts and designs are inspiring. 
So, I wanted to be a painter like him, except, I don't know how to paint. 
Well, at least, we did once. 
And he does that every day, and every day, probably, that guy in the picture walks on by, because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him. 
Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian, he's looking down at Martha, the last passenger pigeon alive. 
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously, by NHK of Japan. 
The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties. 
But what I realized was that you had to have options. 
And, I love this story so much. 
I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it. 
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package. 
The angels prostrate, not before the human body, but before the human soul. 
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis. 
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here, Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole. 
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. 
Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like. 
and I'm still pricking bees." (Laughter) And then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?" 
We have 120 partner institutions all over the world, in all those countries colored orange. 
(Applause) So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. 
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all. 
Let me connect the dots. 
And that comes in tremendously handy, because groups are smarter than individuals. 
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex. 
Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. 
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. 
The present self does not want to save at all. 
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells. 
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging. 
He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here, and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science. 
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration, I think this is the new zeitgeist: open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long. 
Home is a transient concept. 
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. 
So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, "Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing." 
(Laughter) Made perfect sense. 
The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. 
Let's lock her up." 
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically, projects where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back. 
And again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. 
So we bought that land, and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere. 
And on the C.D., this was on. 
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets. 
Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse, is it Unilever or is it P&amp;G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?" 
And inside this reactor is a molten salt, so anybody who's a fan of thorium, they're going to be really excited about this, because these reactors happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle, uranium-233. 
So I would collect the tips and get payment. 
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do -- even the good, well-intentioned companies. 
Our games don't always do this. 
This is bigger than the state of Arizona. 
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously. 
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them. 
(Laughter) And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. 
It is precious, it is unique, it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known. 
Can you imagine? 
(Applause) So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. 
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities, so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this. 
Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero. 
And he said to the guy, "Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see?" 
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices, the 10 secrets, the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness. 
Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. 
Co-branding opportunities. 
Why don't we care more about gross national happiness?" 
He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect. 
Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open. 
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients. 
And when we run experiments, we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another. 
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. 
You will need advocates. 
(Music) And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. 
You know, everything says, here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S., here it goes -- straight line. 
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it. 
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion. 
if we have goals and dreams, and we want to do our best, and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them, we should feel pain when things go wrong. 
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen -- it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew. 
It's incredibly painful. 
I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject. 
And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance. 
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. 
We need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans, including the older trials, because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008, and I don't know what world it is in which we're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years. 
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along, as long as certain conditions are met. 
Do it. 
Older people can view injustice with compassion, but not despair. 
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. 
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling? 
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you. 
All other animals live in an objective reality. 
And I call it an epoxy method because -- it's not very appetizing. I understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy? 
And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they’d brought. 
Moral ambiguity starts to climb. 
This is a blog from Iraq, and it's not really what I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example. 
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. 
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. 
And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list, I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. 
Since they're doing some of these same jobs, maybe they should have some of those things. 
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. 
We found, testing thousands of individuals, that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus. 
And stop with the labels, the limiting. 
But we saw the same thing. 
It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. 
You don't have millions and millions of dollars, but you can call your representatives, and you can remind them that you vote, and you can ask not to be treated like a thief, and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. 
Over 20,000 economists whose job it is, competitive entry to get there, couldn't see what was happening. 
It was hunted to death for its feathers. 
That's my favorite scenario. 
(Laughter) But this is rarely a good sign. Right? 
This is just one example. 
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. 
So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands. 
This process does no harm, and Daisy the cow can live a happy life. 
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. 
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption, or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential. 
There was an energy there, an implacable optimism, a strange mixture of humility and daring. 
Nothing to see, move along. 
They've never been dived." 
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that. 
It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. 
We don't talk about the sacrifice. 
To understand power diffusion put this in your mind: computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century. 
Of course, digital video is cheap now. 
And I think for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. 
By that time, the battle against HIV would already have been lost. 
We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. 
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don't understand, and Kentucky? 
And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. 
To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. 
Sticker templates. 
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built. 
And their decisions about software coding, engineering, design, terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives. 
This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially, a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in. 
Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. 
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. 
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks. 
I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. 
He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted, he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas. 
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫ ♫ Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫ ♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫ ♫ Nothing more to say ♫ ♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫ ♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫ ♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫ ♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫ ♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫ ♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫ ♫ You don't have to be a big celebrity ♫ ♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫ 
So a city of the future, I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens, integrates socially its citizens. 
This is the reality that we deal with. 
We could use sales, anything you like. 
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents, and that goat had twins. 
The book was published in 2009. 
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants, we completely miss the story. 
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo, from the late Arthur C. Clarke, who said, "I want to see what's going on." 
And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. 
It is this that caught and held my attention to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale. 
And think of things in your life that are binary, one of them is light switches. 
Data: Hello TEDWomen. 
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. 
It's very positive. 
We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends. 
Other women became mad, driven machines like me. 
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. 
So look to the right-hand side of the screen. 
What he showed -- he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system. 
But just substitute apartment building for cities. 
The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love. 
And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind. 
Thank you. 
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
No more are we going to accept this." 
Third, that thou shall have reverence. 
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old, because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark. 
That means, you know, net fertility farming. 
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone, and they were starting to sink. 
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box, and we get a lot a new neighbors. 
You may think we can explain the Great Divergence in terms of geography. 
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them, and what I'm going to try and show is that actually, victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism. 
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop, what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea. 
So, what do we see? 
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance. 
The big challenge in front of us. 
And that's what the lawn was. 
You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice. 
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors. 
He'd call out terrorism for what it is, not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for. 
We take that tissue, we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology, and then we put a florescent tag on it. 
Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize; our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught. 
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. 
And so people live far, far away. 
And let me start by telling you, I gotcha. 
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object. 
So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England. 
We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2, which can easily be piped to sites, convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process. 
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit, and still feel good about ourselves. 
And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones. 
And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam. 
We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do. 
Now there's often no right or wrong here. 
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. 
And cartoons can cross boundaries, as you have seen. 
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?" 
When we look at the universities, 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now, which is a significant shift. 
A son and his father are in a horrible car accident. 
If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attackers. 
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21. 
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful, inspiring or funny. 
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. 
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure, consistent novelty. 
And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too. 
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times, and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. 
They're of a new nature: they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle. 
In a village called Wallajeh, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus. 
Thank you. 
Hannah Arendt said, "The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. 
I decided against clothing because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time-specific elements. 
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. 
It was not that painting, but that painting. 
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. 
But the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light, recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. 
The mass of this comes out of the air. 
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century. 
So, it has to be the other way about. 
Thank you so much. 
And importantly, it's a rich source of vitamin B12. 
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse. 
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her." 
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms. 
They're a cult all their own, blood brothers steeped in other people's blood. 
Find an artist or a writer -- or, heaven forbid, find a philosopher and talk to them. 
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal. 
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. 
Okay, so how would you solve this one? 
We see it at the d.school all the time. 
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. 
I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. 
And that's the sad part. 
[Allegiance] [Very intimate] [Serious mistakes] (Laughter) And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. 
The gun goes off, and she's not even an underdog. 
Now this may seem a bit ambitious, but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands, you realize that you're alive. 
Here's a really cool problem. I like this. 
A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg. 
George did not speak. 
And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives. 
That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure. 
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. 
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there -- right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored. 
My goal was when the building was demolished, because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste, so my building has to be reused or recycled. 
Well we can begin to ask those questions also. 
Thank you very much. 
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie? 
So the question is: How are we all going to respond to this? 
And then they started crime mapping. 
We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. 
Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. 
Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful, and it grows. Thank you. 
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? 
So my story is a tale of two brains, because it might surprise you, our gut has a full-fledged brain. 
But there is actually a very positive side to this, and that is this: The 27 million people who are in slavery today, that's a lot of people, but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. 
It was deep at night. 
And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. 
(Applause) (Bells) (Trumpet) Rachelle Garniez: ♫ Quand il me prend dans ses bras ♫ ♫ Il me parle tout bas, ♫ ♫ Je vois la vie en rose. ♫ ♫ Il me dit des mots d'amour, ♫ ♫ Des mots de tous les jours, ♫ ♫ Et ca me fait quelque chose. ♫ ♫ Il est entre dans mon coeur ♫ ♫ Une part de bonheur ♫ ♫ Dont je connais la cause. ♫ ♫ C'est lui pour moi. Moi pour lui ♫ ♫ Dans la vie, ♫ ♫ Il me l'a dit, l'a jure [pour] la vie. ♫ ♫ Et des que je l'apercois ♫ 
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier. 
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago. 
Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health. 
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent, if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress -- your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points. 
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. 
I'm going to find that out, and when I find that out, I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause. 
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. 
What do people want in their TV then? 
It looks like I've paused the program. 
Courage, according to Churchill, is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter) And [Joyce] said that mistakes are the portals of discovery. 
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so, what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it. 
We also are going to need political innovation. 
Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away. 
In reality, take a guess. 
The information was inside my house and it was awesome. 
And their politics are not entirely unattractive. 
So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest. 
The story that we're told is that there was a "light footprint" initially -- in other words, that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops, we didn't have enough resources, that Afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security, and therefore the Taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments, but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground. 
(Laughter) All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words? 
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip. 
Find me when you can." 
The 21st century gift, which is very, very important for the whole world, whether it is global economic meltdown, whether it is climate change -- any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more -- not only the current generations, for the future generations. 
So what we did, we went to Alaska, which is where the grizzlies rely on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes for their denning. 
First one is really a question of origins. 
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big. 
And then you have a third party saying, "Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy." 
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough. 
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family. 
We have another possibility we are working [on] in our lab, [which] is to build hybrids. 
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. 
This has huge implications. 
(Music) So I have a gift I want to share with you today, a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed, and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. 
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice." 
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people, creating ideas, innovation, wealth and so on. 
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. 
It's unbelievable. 
I was burned very badly. 
So you photograph that in exactly the same position, and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges. 
Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. 
You also have to do it. 
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?" 
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. 
So what I did, I took all those emails, and I put them together into something called Angrigami, which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. 
You just look at the political history of the 20th century, and you see things have changed a lot. 
"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in 1434?" 
But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. 
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. 
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation. 
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land. 
But when you take a close look, you start to see the holes, and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. 
Some women have those heart attacks, but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack, where it erodes, doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle, EKG findings are different -- female-pattern. 
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Some will be down to two or three. 
I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have. 
So they formed a White House task force, and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. 
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. 
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. 
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen. 
And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket? 
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap. 
As you know, when you put oil and water together, they don't mix, but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form, and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell, as you will see later. 
It's got light organs in the mouth, it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins, in a mucus layer on the back and the belly, all used for different things -- some of which we know about, some of which we don't. 
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. 
The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. 
Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. 
Now for some people, that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism. 
She rocketed to the top of her class. 
Because with our own little telescope, just in the next two years, we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them. 
And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules, the ways that rules can keep people in the dark, look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night. 
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. 
That's only online -- no print, no TV. 
This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it. 
Maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore. 
First, you have to offer them confidentiality. 
And there's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. 
I used to study mice. When I studied mice, I used to talk really slowly. 
Let's start by asking who's doing well. 
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town. 
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance. 
Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, "Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner." 
While still in a research phase, stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. 
And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine, was launched on the 13th of January, 1976. 
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." 
It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time. 
We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan -- really about three of them. 
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research, which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago. 
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no, I have worked for the policy changes. 
I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. 
They named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements. 
Privacy is the building block of our democracies. 
Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations -- how your parents approach Internet security, versus how you do, versus how our kids will. 
The pack stays together. 
So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that, through the support of many people, not only here but online, the BRCK has been Kickstarted, and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins. 
There's no exchange of ideas between them. 
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. 
But, some researchers, myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative. 
Why bows? 
I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?" 
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue. 
So in wildlife rescue, as in life, we learn from each previous experience, and we learn from both our successes and our failures. 
The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love; none without water." 
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it, because you couldn't. No use for it. 
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile? 
And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations, because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air, is the sum of emissions over time. 
It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions. 
Okay, I'm going to sort you out. 
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism, the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor. 
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens. 
Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan. 
And I worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we've convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating, and we start to devalue the things that we can do every day, and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves take credit for it, and we don't let ourselves feel good about it. 
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. 
It allows us to make sense of the world around us. 
And as I lifted my leg out of bed, she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. 
But come to find out, a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there's a negotiation period with all teams, and each team takes a turn, then we go back in negotiation, around and around, so each turn around is one game day. 
And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer. 
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities. 
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism. 
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities, trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. 
All you have to say is, "Make words," and they know exactly what to do. 
We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano. 
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. 
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image, just in case they might want to use it. 
In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, getting the absolute cheapest way to do something, so why aren't we doing that with social policy? 
And two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years? 
I thought, that guy looks suspicious. 
Now this picture shows the demolition of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio in Shanghai earlier this year. 
But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. 
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades. 
The service which grew out of this, Dial 1298 for Ambulance, with one ambulance in 2004, now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states, and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception. 
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go, from the mainland, to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys. 
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen, sharing our music with you. 
Now, you've heard about "two degrees": that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. 
Everybody around the table laughed, but the joke was kind of a good solution, so that's what we ended up doing. 
It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years. 
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups, which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours. 
And we found that if your friend becomes obese, it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period. 
If you would please, please do it across all five continents and send me the data, then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds, and create the future of learning. 
It's a film that you can look through. 
This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values. 
I forget we have chocolate in the house. 
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do, what is the best way to achieve my goals? 
You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf, on behalf of the people who got the shoes. 
We traveled through five seas, two oceans, nine ports, and I learned a lot about shipping. 
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off, so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project. 
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. 
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world." 
So, before I got here, I thought, "You know, I am from North America. 
Run away. Run. 
So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that. 
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa. 
In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. 
So it's really not even about urban versus rural. 
So through microblogging, we are able to understand Chinese youth even better. 
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this. 
We took a page out of XKCD, and we said, "Stand back. 
Where instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies. 
And there'd also be an extinction event -- like fossils would suddenly disappear. 
That interpretation is quite possible and feasible. 
So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning: radical increases in resource efficiency, closing loops and a solar economy. 
And then, the systemic risks. 
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources. 
Thank you. 
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing. 
The sounds of the voices were harmonious. 
We figure out what will happen with this technology. 
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. 
What if you could change the sperm and the ova, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer? 
"We have lasers; we can whiten it out." 
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. 
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here, and they will accumulate in the drunkest, stingiest people. 
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. 
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. 
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter. 
And it has to be bi-directional. 
There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them. 
Wonderful study comparing different countries. 
Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses, you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. 
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. 
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes -- a very large number. 
(Laughter) (Applause) In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency. 
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement. 
Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors. 
And I don't remember papercutting as a child. 
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals." 
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time. 
Vaccines were promised to developing countries. 
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. 
And that's because, in contrast with crony capitalism, so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive. 
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible, that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line. 
The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap. 
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. 
Show them the grumpy employees. 
But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions, through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. 
And as it turns out, fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. 
And now with one dollar, you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you. 
Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it? 
Thank you. 
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area. 
It's not going to be easy. 
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said, "You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour." 
When we find a match, we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. 
(Music) (Laughter) Yeah. 
To investigate this question, we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son, and his son has terminal brain cancer. 
These are little wells. 
There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset, a totally different society. 
There's nothing worse than, you know, getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that. 
I used to be able to talk like that. 
It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up," but they might as well have. 
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. 
It's this, just like this. 
One says, "Weapon of mass protection." 
Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium. 
I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. 
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish. 
That is, you know what simplicity is, you know what complexity is. 
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. 
(Laughter) But we have no idea why it does that. 
(Laughter) And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. 
It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid -- in this case blood -- surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen. 
And you can think back to 1941 when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. 
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit. 
This is a way to reanimate the world, and that's what's so exciting about this perspective. 
Because we have tested ARES model, several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years, under Mars conditions. 
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. 
And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K., but if you do the math, you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches. 
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk, that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died, and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. 
And we are simply running out of spectrum. 
Well, with the new technologies emerging now, I hope we can say definitively, "Yes." 
(Applause) So here's the most important economic fact of our time. 
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control, whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice. 
(Whistling) But it can also sound like this. 
Right, so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people. 
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital. 
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is true. 
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years. 
They'd say, "This is very boring." 
Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web, I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing, about that event. 
The big questions facing physics. 
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact, it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults, you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were. 
There's no doubt that from now on, the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence, but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. 
And so gradually the selection, the composition of politicians, would shift from the crooked to the honest. 
In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. 
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. 
But -- (Laughter) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger. 
She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. 
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. 
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community. 
Energy use. Organisms sip energy, because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get. 
And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast, and they said to Solly, on the side, they said, "Before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live." 
In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood. 
Those were the achievements of our great regime. 
Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math. 
It took about a year for me to learn this, but it's really been worth it. 
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened; the entrepreneurs received the money, they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew, and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. 
So, you can't see the black hole itself, but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. 
And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. 
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior, and voting behavior, and divorce -- which can spread -- and altruism. 
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. 
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed. 
Now this is not all necessarily good news, because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love. 
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system? 
They almost brought the entire financial system down. 
You can be logical and intuitive. 
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?" 
And he says, "What did you do with the other child?" 
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here. 
When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. 
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right. 
Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. 
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret? 
And it's then being ripped open. 
Thank you very much. 
This is just completely ridiculous." 
So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem. 
Because she had some damage to her nerves, she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep, half dead. 
(Laughter) But it turns out, I jumped on a plane, and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. 
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code -- we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study. 
They saw it as thinking. 
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. 
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October -- and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place. 
The first one is very simple: experience bars measuring progress -- something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. 
So my parents would go to dinner. 
And that, after a couple of days, made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. 
This is ours. 
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, "Should I really take as much money as I can? 
And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed. 
Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear. 
This young woman wished for other things to happen, it happened for her. 
But I want to go back now and revisit these steps, and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation, because I really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels: the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level, the political or ethical level. 
And they were inspired not by the young Einstein, who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein, the icon of poster and t-shirt, who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. 
I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us. 
And in studies of kids playing, it’s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure, who are in a kind of trusted environment -- they’re the ones that feel most free to play. 
We wondered: does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one? 
And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. 
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. 
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago, and plants followed several hundred million years later. 
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. 
We all know the short answer. 
That's amazing. 
So, with physical materials, we're used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes. 
It can be learning to cook a new dish, picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.

And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton? 
And I'm just saying, "No way." 
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art, but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences. 
Very sadly, he took his own life. 
The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences, in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects. 
And because it's encrypted, it can be submitted, stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see, including you. 
And most importantly, it's working. 
How has this happened? 
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. 
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. 
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered, much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value -- all thrown away. 
So I will leave you with that. Thank you. 
I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization.

Well, a poor understanding. 
These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. 
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. 
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it. 
So, the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. 
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience.

He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. 
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this. 
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely, is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run. 
It's wavy. 
Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world. 
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges. 
And the test is: one, will it do the job? 
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them.

And I would say, "But that's crazy." 
Now it turns out you're right. 
They're all about transformation. 
(Laughter) This was another one I could not get a loaner of. 
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets, we're using air classification. 
We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. 
If you're like most people, just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before. 
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently. 
Though it was based on very little evidence, many scientists thought that all mammalian brains, including the human brain, were made in the same way, with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. 
More animals, if they start doing searches as well. 
Think about those oldest living things on Earth, but in a cosmic proportion. 
These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India.

They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. 
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me. 
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish. 
And so our next interface, which I'll show you, actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity. 
Girl 2: Uh, yeah. 
The blue whale, it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is, this wonderful, magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. 
Well it so happens that we have a singular body. 
Because I can't explain otherwise, when I look at the figures, what's going on.

We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read, as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea. 
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project, and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. 
And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. 
The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. 
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.

And as I say, energy was necessary. 
Then the groom's father, then the groom, then the family, then the friends -- arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun. 
One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. 
And we get confirmation. 
Now, here's the story. 
The wound is just filled with maggots. 
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level, beneath its weight. 
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. 
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere, and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas, but we also have problems that, when we lose power, we can't open a window here, and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. 
Have fun with that. It's very exciting. 
(Laughter) I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction. 
And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. 
It's called a lobotomy.

I now know that my real strength never came from my body, and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically, who I am is unchanged. 
Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down." 
In the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red, totally out of bounds.

In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. 
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother. 
They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools.

Nearly 7,000 people were killed, and the city like this Nagata district, all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake. 
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces. 
And we think that these affect the way language is learned. 
This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story, but also a feminine story. 
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. 
But that's kind of a big problem. 
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us. 
And it starts getting really nice. 
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality. 
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. 
Or maybe you turn to the past. 
You see some incredible stuff. 
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. 
And we did video clips -- you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons. 
It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data: names of places, monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street. 
Which brings us back to Harriet. 
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist, and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes. 
And all things being equal, older people direct their cognitive resources, like attention and memory, to positive information more than negative. 
You don't have enough time. 
In 1900, for example, nobody was killed by cars in the United States. 
And if we're going to engage them, I think that's what we've got to do. 
We wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine: average depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet; two and half hours to get to work in the morning; two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work. 
I was quite shocked by that, and thought to myself, "Well, OK then. 
We look at where the emissions are coming from -- they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth, and we say, okay, well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning, so therefore, the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy. 
And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all, is a very scary place indeed. 
Big support team. We had a film crew, a couple of logistics people with us, my girlfriend, a photographer.

Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil -- and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? -- but look at sub-Saharan Africa. 
Well, what I concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation. 
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI. 
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units, and each of those units are given shape by the baker. 
And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us. 
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?" 
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad. 
How would I know who was the best? 
She really paved the way at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead. 
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely, the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. 
Our sewers are crumbling. 
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. 
We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world. 
Now, look at this. 
(Laughter) Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. 
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist, but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. 
Ideas truly are what make the world go round. 
I loved the attention. 
These are three words many of us were raised with. 
This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. 
And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world. 
Every year, it begins with a snowflake, and by digging into fresh snow, we can see how this process is ongoing today. 
But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change, a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body. 
It's clearly undisturbed by us. 
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much. 
Larry, you can explain this one. 
Now, the issue about tattoos is that, without a word, tattoos really do shout. 
But if you go to our site and search for "Deskbar," you'll get this. 
We cherish corpses. 
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks, and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense. 
Is there something driving this? 
But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. 
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. 
That's something on the order of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone. 
We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well-being. 
This is, under German law, allowed, and the members of our parliament don't want to change this, and this is why they can't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very, very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world, but not able to ratify the convention, which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world. 
It has to do with the favelas, the slums -- whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world. 
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. 
In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower. 
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth that's prevalent in business now. 
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords. 
(Applause) So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. 
Now we're not there yet. 
And he was very, very sorry. 
But all the schools are solar-lit. 
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. 
(Applause) Wow. 
(Laughter) Unicum in Hungary, for example. 
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water bomb base. 
And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase. 
You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long. 
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew. 
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged. 
The Dalai Lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. 
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper, one for FHM magazine. 
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too. 
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. 
(Applause) So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. 
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life. 
The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism. 
And they have absolutely amazing education systems. 
You can see on a graph, after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow, just after redesign. 
There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. 
So, it really was cognitive psychology -- you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing. 
They would go to coffee houses, where they would tell a story in front of an audience, often improvising. 
And I thought, "You know, I wonder what my soleus muscle is?" 
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. 
So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, "Could I do with a little life editing? 
And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. 
This is what it would look like if you went to the site. 
I was taught that when I was very, very young. 
(Laughter) Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results? 
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes. 
So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core, and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt, the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive. 
Just being out on the street was exhilarating. 
That in creating the move to high-volume, low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials, or for that matter, ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology, the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet. 
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. 
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS. 
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. 
Right? 
Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete? 
And I now move on to the second part of my talk, and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned. 
By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. 
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most. 
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake. 
The oil was running out, and a nuclear winter would finish us off. 
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump. 
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. 
He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem, and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license." 
So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. 
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. 
And it worked, or so I believed. 
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it. 
Now look, naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week, but the truth is it didn't really bother us. 
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. 
The first is the fall of Granada, the last Muslim enclave in Europe. 
I think now I never was pure. 
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. 
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. 
Because that's what will stop: economic growth. 
From there, we dove in. 
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen: deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen, which you can get from seawater, and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen. 
And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. 
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on. 
It's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea. 
You can see faint detail that starts to come through. 
It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living. 
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. 
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. 
Andre told me, after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way, that there is no new research here. 
His legacy is with us still. 
John Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver, who's also a class champion at Le Mans. 
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us, what once mystified and separated us. 
(Applause) It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. 
Einstein, can you also sing? 
This was work from many people, but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. 
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism. 
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. 
This is a nuclear-proof facility. 
It has many consequences. 
Now language's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship, in books you can't read, phrases you can't use and words you can't say. 
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. 
We'd like to understand that. 
And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. 
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. 
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. 
So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. 
A part of me had become alienated from myself. 
And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin. 
In other words, I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral. 
They do it to make a profit. 
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun, so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle, like some Earthlings. 
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified, when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it, and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought. 
Over the next few days, I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. 
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase. 
A few years ago I started developing littleBits. 
One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. 
But once he gets there, he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property. 
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen." 
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. 
Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to, and compare it to this biosphere. 
So, contrary to popular belief, there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values. 
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?" 
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes! 
Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal. 
The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups. 
And he sequenced, he took skin cells, healthy skin, and cancerous bone marrow, and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks, no big deal. 
But the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together. 
And the reason for this is because -- well, there are two reasons, I think. 
This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology. 
So the second rule is I get important information back. 
(Applause) I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon, which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. 
What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all? 
It's an incredibly insightful definition. 
Will it provide high quality care? 
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know, when all else is equal, given the option to have just money to do what you need to do, or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community, people choose the community plus the money. 
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging, we can see what young people care most about. 
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. 
And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. 
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. 
You can read the details, but in summary, we can transform our economy. 
The point is that we have to have a context, a gauge for our actions in all this. 
And they're more vulnerable to job losses, subject to inflation, tightening loans from banks, appreciation of the renminbi, or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce. 
Because the way things stand today, electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply. 
(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. 
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental point of view. 
You could inform school policy. 
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf, and on the middle, cotton leaf, and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. 
Well, let's go back to this picture. 
Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble, who is an unusually gifted woman, but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. 
And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan, and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation, and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say, "Come back to me. 
We've done right now two human brains-worth of data. 
Do you know what people want more than anything? 
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village? 
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. 
But the paradox is, when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode, that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. 
That, to me, is an incredible thing. 
When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was? 
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story. 
So for example, when you've got military checkpoints. 
The two groups are not talking to each other. 
There's no other cause. 
But people do because it's so cheap, and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted. 
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor. 
So when my twin brother Kaesava was born, he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. 
If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision. 
(Laughter) The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today. 
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe. 
One out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. 
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends." 
You can do that quite fast. 
Thank you. 
Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. 
(Applause) And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. 
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to congregations about compassion, I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter) Now -- but that's not the whole story. 
We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. 
MA: From some people. 
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student. (Laughter) "I have this great project -- 50 million years." 
The symbols are most commonly found on seals. 
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16. 
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. 
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it. 
I was a failure. 
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. 
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict. 
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph, Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me. 
I warmed the battery up in my armpit. 
1866: the beginning of the transcontinental railroad -- a new era. 
MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. 
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map. 
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free. 
And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879. 
(Laughter) I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring." 
So there you are. 
Openness isn't the end. 
Poetry does that. 
Really new. 
So, this is frozen water. 
But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. 
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. 
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. 
And then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement. 
We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen, capable of experiencing so many of these things. 
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. 
And when you get a radical innovation, it's often very uncertain how it can be applied. 
I love to travel, and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities. 
But if you want to reach the very top, you should delay gratification and, of course, become a politician. 
But when you think about it, your friends are long-term adventures, and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life, and life to your years. Thank you very much. 
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there. 
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy, over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was, a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. 
Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat. 
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that. 
On the side here, this is temporal cortex. 
(Applause) My topic is economic growth in China and India. 
And that is because of the atmosphere. 
So what happened? 
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals, the markets, the restaurants, the cantinas, the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades, the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead, San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life, the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn't disappear from this world. 
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. 
We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. 
That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China, because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. 
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. 
That's my simple understanding of human rights. 
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets, and then I waited for my father to come back from work with, one could say, much apprehension. 
The problem is these are arousal addictions. 
Now how did the gut actually participate in this development? 
I've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student. 
And the response of the world was great: Two billion dollars got pledged just last month, so that's about 10,000 dollars per death. 
Ladies and gentlemen, that is not an unusual story. 
But it was kind of an interesting thought. 
Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den." 
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. 
Thank you very much. 
However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former. 
Ben Kacyra: You can see here, these systems are extremely fast. 
I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends. 
And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project, and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eugène Spaak, who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time, space, love, music and women. 
I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here -- this axis here is child mortality -- and here I have the family size. 
A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. 
Here's what the new Main Street looks like. 
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles. 
This remarkable image is not a map of the world. 
We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh, throughout the U.K., for Welsh people. 
Students have to develop those, they have to formulate those. 
So I think we have to be in the lead. 
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin. 
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were, and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew. 
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management. 
And what barcoding does is use a specific gene called CO1 that's consistent within a species, but varies among species. 
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue. 
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles that you had on Speedo bathing suits, that broke all those records in the Olympics, but it's a particular kind of pattern. 
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out. 
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. 
But back to the Phoenix Islands, which is the subject of this Talk. 
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. 
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me. 
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape. 
He needs help getting 10 million dollars. 
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. 
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living," and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want; instead, it's about wanting what you have. 
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever. 
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth, we realized we had fallen in love with the place. 
Why the Greeks? 
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years? 
But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity, and it's dramatic. 
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. 
And so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere, and moving from one spot to another. 
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion. 
Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees, and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. 
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things. 
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. 
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies, which I'll talk about later. 
Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four -- anyway, less than five. 
The red dots have exploded. 
(Applause) And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions: How is it that the things that make us up have no mass? 
Thank you. 
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. 
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. 
It’s classically learning by doing. 
We could ask it something about the real world. 
Thank you. 
Our little portion of oneness is given a name, is told all kinds of things about itself, and these details, opinions and ideas become facts, which go towards building ourselves, our identity. 
became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion, a conversation, a process, and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since. 
What do they tell us? 
Here's a simple way to do it. 
Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us. 
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things. 
It enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day. 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. 
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. 
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous. 
Mostly you think about, Am I going to survive? 
The first thing that anybody who knows science, and has been around science, is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. 
We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. 
It's now an empty, six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea. 
But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. 
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, "Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011. 
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. 
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around. 
Okay. Anyway. 
You just need inspiration, vision and determination. 
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know that there was no planning in Russia for the next month. 
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. 
So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods, things from which all of us can benefit? 
And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. 
We're using up about five planets. 
But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems. 
They're just strongly held opinions. 
So we can think more about things like street grids. 
I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize. 
This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama. 
They are a right, just as sidewalks are, unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility, without the risk of getting killed. 
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.) John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands. 
It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit. 
In other words, the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero. 
The cash started accumulating, and pretty soon the parents said, "You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school." 
Families need the help. 
What part of this do people not understand? 
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back. 
And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time, that this can be a whole lot of fun. 
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?" 
It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. 
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles, whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle, isn't it? Right?

So that's the other gene we're looking for. 
And you then feel you must act. 
And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. 
If half of a community sleeps under a net, the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread. 
(Laughter) CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. 
But they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are.

Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to know what everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem. 
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers. 
"You can exchange groups. 
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side. 
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. 
Okay, now if you want to play, I want you to stand up, okay? 
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others. 
If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world. 
So we're thrilled. 
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story." 
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. 
They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes, through technology like telescopes and microscopes, and also what they're thinking about in their minds. 
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference. 
And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is, as part of Plan Colombia, we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is -- we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. 
Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest -- because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050. 
It's a vocational training path. 
We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently, at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel. 
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait. 
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia. 
How do we try to understand what China is? 
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.

This is a real medical need, literally a life-saving donation. 
A young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is CCTV by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. 
And this is the kind of thing that I got back. 
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. 
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive. 
I thought, my career's over. 
But having been born in Essex, at the age of 16, I joined an organization. 
So why is this important? 
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid. 
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it. 
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency, this is the picture that you come up with.

If you presented it with a chess board, it tried to figure out what you might mean by that. 
If you lost, you died. 
"What are you doing for America's kids?" 
And whether that's because of food production, or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn't be, or because of habitats being used for other purposes -- all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt, or die, or move. 
We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being. 
They don't have any carbon content. 
He was 94 when this photograph was taken. 
18 months later I woke up. 
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.

But this is the end result. 
And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. 
The future has arrived, and the future is now. 
But this is really just the beginning. 
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched. 
I slammed on the brakes. 
So we took these hundred dollar bills, and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com, where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. 
What's more important? 
It's a noisy material, and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. 
So this is a first indication that the "all brains are made the same way" scenario is not quite right. 
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better. 
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms.

And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences, the human sciences, economics, et cetera. 
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution, what I would call the opposite of Type 101. 
He was premature. But he was a moral compass -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control. 
So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. 
So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. 
That's another killer app. 
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. 
There is the cognitive component, which is, "I understand you." 
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind, and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around. 
But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. 
Give you one example of that: Intention is very important in sound, in listening. 
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user, who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."

But some of the monarchs were sick, and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies, meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants. 
Then I went to run 50K, then 60K. 
But, if we put money into the core budget, we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent.

It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future. 
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. 
Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen? 
Last year on climate, for example, we had the highest global emissions ever. 
They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me, literally cut me in half, I have a scar that wraps around my entire body.

I also traveled to Cape Cod to look at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale, because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea, and what it made me think about. 
How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have, the visions of how we're going to change the world, the key thing is implementation. We have the vision. 
There's an outer layer and an inner layer. 
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. 
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted, smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. 
It's actually very popular. 
A few months later, I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built, and took pictures of seven of my new friends, posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website, spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal. 
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak. 
And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why, in the end, there may be some good news. 
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building, but this is much stronger than I expected, and also it's very easy to waterproof, and also, because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof. 
(Laughter) Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy? 
And then she said, "Janine, you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life, because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before."

Privacy is nonnegotiable. 
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.

The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. 
You can imagine what something like this might look like five, 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve. 
We walked out of Africa two times. 
Now, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world, and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war. 
Jimmy Kimmel actually. 
It's connected; it all hooks into each other. 
You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. 
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone. 
Because I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.

So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat, in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. 
So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain, that of the multinational company, and get them to do the right thing, get them to use that power for good, to deliver the key public goods.

This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name. 
So, what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish, as you see on the left in front of you. 
But it wasn't easy. 
That's called "rounding." 
Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story -- He said he'd been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound.

So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. 
And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. 
I said, "I'm designing newspapers." 
And to begin to answer such questions, my research group -- since over 25 years now -- works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old. 
I'm incredibly excited about that. 
(Laughter) What about a wolf? 
So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. 
I knew I wasn't ready. I knew I had to quit." 
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden. 
(Laughter) So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one. 
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her. 
And of course it will bring great things. 
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.

It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world, which is a little bit surprising when you think about it. 
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates -- into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet. 
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. 
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.

Red circle. 
Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance. 
Today, the average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German -- a thousand. 
So I will not really go too far into it. 
And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also -- and I'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. 
(Applause) Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. 
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. 
Could it be there is something more going on here? 
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant, I received my next assignment, and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. 
They want to hold on to what they've got. 
I shivered -- (Laughter) -- contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room, and said "Girls, hold the front page. 
So this ingenuity of our ancestors, to invent this most marvelous technology. 
And you turn around, and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in, and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth. 
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person who is sitting next to you. 
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base. 
And next year, she will come back. 
Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like. 
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. 
(Laughter) But elsewhere in the world, if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea, you will get essentially a blank face. 
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating. 
And why? Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers, making this beautiful, iridescent mother of pearl. 
I did comic book arbitrage. 
So this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen, you put them in a pan, and you apply energy. 
A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. 
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. 
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955. 
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment, well at least with our own launch vehicles, but NASA is far from dead, and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. 
A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics. 
Can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers, introduce it to our cars, and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future? 
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO.

There's diatoms made out of SIO2, and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation. 
This is again showing all the different contributions. 
It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this, it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain. 
Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago. 
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter) To leave would be failure. 
KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants. 
The good news about this is that the global community -- again, my Brazilian friends tell me -- is pitching in to help out. 
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. 
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily, we just have to know how to pull it out. 
And I said, "Well, my real hero was my father. 
I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea, generally. 
And ultimately, we have to try that. 
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. 
So I believe this kept me running.

Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border. 
That comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities. 
Be a mentor. 
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process. 
In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people. 
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality? 
We're done. You know, I've seen that island. 
And it's really simple, as you can see here. 
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's a critically important problem, and you might say, "Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?" 
When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback. 
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation. 
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. 
I have typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. 
Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today: Project Space Jump. 
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called "the examined life." 
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. 
And I ended up like going down the spices, and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper, thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. 
You become very creative, in a survival sense. 
Now this is one of the images. 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 
So when you are done, just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session. 
Was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution? 
Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television, and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent. 
What would that look like for society? 
This is a science of listening. 
Third, personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks -- so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name. 
And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics. 
talking about the future of cities. 
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. 
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. 
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out. 
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto. 
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset. 
We've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two-dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston. 
They're MIT undergraduates. 
That's the wrong answer. 
And she says, "I am." 
It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. 
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. 
The front page became our signature. 
When we face these crises, we have kept the potential, the huge potential of our society out of this process, and we are closing in on ourselves in politics, and I think we need to change that, to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology, the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions which are much better, but we have to be open. 
But the Mongols get there first. 
How did I do this? 
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc. 
More is bad. 
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels. 
So the conditions for success here are listed. 
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders, we need Bricklayers Without Borders, to rebuild the skill set. 
For one, overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. 
They can also see vacant property. 
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. 
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed, because something horrible has happened to them, then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation, and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones, because they do not want to burden them. 
I will also add one other thing. 
One of the most intriguing features about Mars, the National Academy of Science says one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age, is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. 
Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally, but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. 
And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification. 
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure? 
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. 
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito, vente a comer mi hijo!" 
And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. 
I finally got to taste it before I left. 
So most everyone watches TV. 
What that means, of course, is that, in the past, things were closer together. 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. 
So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter. 
So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. 
A traditional bone setter is a professional. 
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things, like how to be on time. 
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad, and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids, and the parents don't want to be bothered with that, or their rap music or whatever. 
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so. 
My head was cut open across the front, lifted back, exposing the skull underneath. 
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. 
So the great project of our generation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future. 
And in the northern part of the main island, this is ground zero for world longevity. 
I want you to consider for a moment if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you're braking, that you're coming to a dead stop. 
My office folds away, easily hidden. 
It's an infinite number -- literally goes on forever. 
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. 
This is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. 
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey. 
I was doing a show, and they said, "We're going to send a driver to pick you up." 
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler. 
My people build all the time with clay, but they don't see any innovation with mud. 
I will not dance to your drummed-up war. 
They are also part of this world. 
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby, but you know, her body was very immature, and she ended up having obstructed labor. 
So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. 
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project. 
1986, much, much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues, I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure. 
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things, we will take a very big step in that direction. 
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc. 
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring. 
And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. 
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion," or, "reigned himself in by compassion" -- therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. 
Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible." 
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. 
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before. 
That match was unambiguous. 
I am not a breast cancer survivor. 
At some point, as this transience, as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues, that material's actually going to start to dissolve. 
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate. 
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go. 
(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional. 
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. 
We don't want one hero. 
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. 
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. 
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S. 
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. 
That's what we're probably genetically specified for. 
He said, "My knees are still shaking." 
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on. 
In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:" self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other, but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter) So if religion is not about believing things, what is it about? 
But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing. 
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars? 
And so along with changing who worked there, you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into, in particular with women, and it has to do with outside image, dress, the veiled woman. 
But I think we can do both at the same time here. 
How interesting. 
So, something is missing. 
Thank you. 
Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you, and then it will really be a good day. (Music) (Applause) Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you. 
And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. 
You get a new disease that can be deadly. 
(Laughter) "What is this? 
And now we've got the digital revolution. 
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple. 
A film also exists in time; it's an experience that you should go through emotionally. 
Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. 
Even as a scientist, I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible, with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work, until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell, who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. 
I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things. 
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now. 
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, I needed something. 
So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems. 
We can just run an experiment. 
So, much like you're seen at night by a car, then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue, you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk. 
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. 
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. 
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. 
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp." 
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. 
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) -- because I was very small, and I was no good in sports, or anything like that. 
But you just have to go to a garden center, and they're in little paper packets. 
That's social. Let's look at education. 
I'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented. 
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks -- we know that the stick is going up exponentially. 
You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience. 
If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. 
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here. 
We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place. 
Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands, by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. 
The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. 
What about increasing the fudge factor? 
Now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they're a simple model of brain function. 
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter. 
Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago, which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far. 
So all of these galaxies are moving. 
It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today. 
When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India, about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable, he missed the point. 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. 
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s. 
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. 
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. 
In other words, what these females are doing is they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed. 
And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work. 
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. 
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively. 
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign. 
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. 
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. 
(Applause) Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve, to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow. 
So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people. 
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. 
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity. 
(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done. 
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me. 
It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan; the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc. 
And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same. 
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated. 
They have done what I desire to do for them. 
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play. 
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. 
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary. 
Every project has its surprises, and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space. 
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that? 
I want to see this! Give me a chair! 
The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species, the unconscious mind does most of the work. 
Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection. 
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. 
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction. 
This is just nuts. 
Now I wasn't trying to be smart. 
Number two, all of The 99, when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it; they use it for self-interest. 
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on. 
But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. 
Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. 
And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now, and we're just getting all the data together, so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. 
And so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that, from the skeleton alone, has long decomposed. 
Another example: a little bit more mathematical. 
That would be a mistake. 
It's not that complicated. 
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. 
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity. 
If you happen to speak Japanese, think about that little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences. 
New ones are being discovered everyday. 
I said, "It's really, really easy." 
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. 
But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. 
It's great stuff. 
When, in contrast, two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected, then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act. 
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad. 
The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic, quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed. 
It's a serious gene. 
(Laughter) I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. 
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy. 
You might think these are people with master's degrees. 
And that enables us to develop germination protocols. 
They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. 
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. 
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do. 
And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution, through a project called Make History, which we launched in 2009. 
We have amazing antennae. 
MK: I can help you. 
So here's how I came up with the story. 
The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS. 
Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. 
He always made me feel smart. 
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter) I teach high school math. 
And later this year, the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years. 
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on, and then you an see your impact." 
This was a notable moment, because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness -- that leader 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence -- 200 years later, this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure, and it's something we should actually value as government officials. 
And he will push us back. 
So that today, the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. 
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is. 
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica, just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. 
(Laughter) It's not great for parents with kids. 
(Music) Give it another try. 
And the technology we have developed -- it's called SIM OFDM. 
They made his silly outfits, like this, (Laughter) and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever. 
And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. 
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail. 
(Applause) So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert. 
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. 
Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. 
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room, and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars. 
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know? 
The pilot made this great observation: "That's hot." 
Perk up. 
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. 
But I was in for the adventure. 
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal," because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being, into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness. 
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement, which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones. 
Can we use them for communications? 
And then whatever you design virtually, you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later. 
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. 
She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi. 
We need to find more money for game design. 
So now we have the real deal. 
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case: the so-called "correction pen." 
Kevin, can you help? 
Mallory's argument that leaving the house, embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun, however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience. 
That person ate the marshmallow. 
In fact, they have more control over the loss of control than ever before. 
And what could go wrong? 
HA: My age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having, at that time, government, law and order. 
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany. 
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. 
I also planted the bibliotree. 
(Laughter) And I was like, "Thanks, guys." 
They're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are. 
It's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion. 
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus. 
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example, pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power. 
If you think that, Plato's not your guy. 
They serve the demos, democracy. 
And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery. 
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind, you would need about one percent of world land. 
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it. 
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. 
And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. 
SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees. 
Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world. 
In August I'm bringing my sons." 
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules, especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan. 
We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink-like sudden moments of clarity, but in fact, a lot of great ideas linger on, sometimes for decades, in the back of people's minds. 
They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day. 
I look at even my family. 
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. 
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck. 
And so you're bound to make your new drug look better. 
And I won’t be able to say too much about it. 
We don't know anything that eats it, we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done, but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell, about which nobody knows what to do. 
As it was the custom of the time, Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave, together with 14 others in that cathedral. 
We’re trying on these experiences. 
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape. 
And here's a picture of sick ice. 
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists, we're all somewhat narcissistic. 
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me? 
That's my answer to the overpopulation question. 
And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. 
Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy, and for the very first time, we started showing up on the lists. 
And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle. 
So why would I worry? 
We've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media. 
So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past. 
They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history. 
Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape. 
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food, but it's not very portable, generally. 
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it, just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. 
That's not what we found. 
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. 
The second "A" is Awareness. 
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement, (Laughter) that is, what distinguishes games from productive activity, (Laughter) it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential." 
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. 
It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote, so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking, go in reverse if you like, also have braking. 
(Applause) It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe, which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe. 
The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected. 
And you can imagine, the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel. 
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. 
But we want to tell the world that, no, under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people. 
And that's the tough part. 
But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. 
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease. 
Now let's take a look at HIV. 
A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. 
And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big, triply big. 
Well I don't know. 
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire, but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination that attract new people to the crowd. 
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. 
And there's our nanny by the door. 
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city. 
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet, it was the oil that made it sick. 
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple. 
So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment. 
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. 
That is the rocket designer's dream. 
This is what liberation really looks like. 
Thank you. 
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. 
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer. 
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies. 
Some of them are very, very large companies. 
It's just steel and timber. 
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language. 
And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. 
You get really nice 130 nanometer triangles. If you do it again, you can get arbitrary patterns. So on a rectangle you can paint patterns of North and South America, or the words, "DNA." 
So we're going to take it one step further; we've brought my friend Allan back. 
Every season, these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. 
Video: (Music) DM: Now I'll put some percussion in. 
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it. 
With these little macho games we would sometimes play -- and he didn't only play them with me, he played them with all sorts of people -- he would almost always win. 
And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back, and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones. 
But this is the source of innovation. 
But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords, by moneylenders, by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter, because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them. 
So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get. 
In the U.K., you can get up, you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session, you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia, from Canada, God forbid from the U.S. 
I'm sure many of you know the feeling. 
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. 
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED. 
In new cities which are going to be built, this would not be particularly difficult. 
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. 
But some of them have been much more incremental. 
We are in a position of danger. 
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are," because this man looked very happy, and I admired that. 
She uses smart boards, she blogs, she Tweets, she does Facebook, she does all this sort of high-tech stuff. 
That's too long if you're poor. 
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life, only virtually. 
I see only specific pictures. 
I could do it again to show it one more time, but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it. 
It's never allowed to be photographed. 
If I couldn't do that, then what could I do? 
From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man, and then, from there, into an elderly man. 
For example: A person who is cultivating compassion, when they are in the presence of suffering, they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do. 
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. 
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK. 
It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo," and he was writing because he said, "I'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo, as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son." 
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright, and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring." 
It's the participation age, right? 
So how are we doing this in the lab? 
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
(Laughter) The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker. 
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket, you would have a transformative effect. 
Thank you. 
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. 
My hair used to be straight. 
And this kind of gets to this important idea today. 
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and nature, and hasn't made us any happier at all. 
So we didn't use a radar; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals, electronic communication. 
And this is not something wrong with me personally. 
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice." 
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment. 
How does nature repel bacteria? 
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars. 
These are female and male stem cells. 
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. 
I expect health and joy and family and community. 
Obviously nobody has been able to go back to 1930, get all the people born in one maternity unit, and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil, and then half of them eat McDonald's, and then we see how many wrinkles you've got later. 
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was, look, if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends, that is not a crime. That's okay. 
We deal in milliseconds. 
There were just 254 left. 
It became the media platform of 300 million readers. 
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... 
He never used my nickname again. 
I feared he'd go and take his silences with him, and take his secrets with him. 
We are changing our culture from within, but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions. 
PM: What a change that is. 
And pretty early on, those storms started making their presence known. 
This is how you reach people. 
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. 
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now. 
So you got rid of the body shop. 
You know, you once wrote, I like this quote, "If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave." 
How did this great story unfold, the making of Nano? 
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. 
By making friends with everybody and being a leader. 
And you see it in all sorts of technologies. 
It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful, and that it’s a permissive environment. 
But there's actually more to the story than that. 
And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day. 
It's great, but I was in love. 
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days. 
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design, at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials. 
Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet -- have come tumbling down. 
In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth. 
Now, let's do it in a different order. 
There are some dilemmas you see. 
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work. 
And through this work, I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies, so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future. 
I always run it perfectly fine. 
I'm sustaining on seventh year. 
They lie beyond the visible. 
Three key imperatives were really important to our work. 
So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges. 
One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large, but the economy was too small. 
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter) So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. 
I've had some great meals at cafeterias. 
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people. 
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy. 
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca," but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first. 
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students. 
Like, even when you're having a good time, when is the good time over? 
"ReefCity." 
You have sweatshops in hells. 
As you can see, it's impossible to read. 
This is actually the last little image we have of him. 
They did so illegally. 
The water was clear running over sand, and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. 
So let's start just by looking at the CO2 emissions from the life cycle. 
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. 
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony, which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside New Delhi, where I met these characters who showed me around for the day. 
I'd really loved being on board Kendal. 
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s. 
And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs, these transformational needs for our key employees in the company. 
But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality, as it is in other primates. 
You're critical. 
I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security [prison] for six years. 
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? 
Yet still, many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. 
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject? 
That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs." 
People do not enslave people to be mean to them. 
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th. 
And I figured, this has to stop. 
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things? 
Let me give you a small example. 
They're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. 
So we start simple, we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life, and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike. 
They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money." 
There are lots and lots of tests of English. 
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras. 
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. 
But by comparison, we can learn. 
We just think of good weather and bad weather. 
This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. 
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today "mass communication." 
And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out. 
They got healthier. I made more money. 
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing. 
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. 
By staying tightly focused in one place, Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. 
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. 
And for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then, unfortunately, the element kind of melted itself. 
Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways, or leaning against the body. 
This is food 2.0, which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. 
And I asked them once, and I asked them again, and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. 
The first actor is the Security Council. 
See, these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting. 
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid: They accumulate into the top of it. 
That's the economic invisibility of nature. 
What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work, and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. 
So we need to think about it here. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) Today, I'm going to take you around the world in 18 minutes. 
Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely? 
And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics, it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves. 
Behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics, trying to understand the money mistakes people make. 
Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants. 
But that's not enough. 
So, the technology is there. 
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower. 
Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic. 
We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings, and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. 
And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways. 
Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking. 
It's totally almost just like that. 
And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else. 
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good. 
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution. 
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar. 
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet. 
So let's give this a try. 
We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. 
I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families. 
It was done by a guy named Goose. 
The same, I felt, was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to, and to some extent the same is true of us. 
It's very difficult to work in the intestine. 
Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. 
It's new in our history. 
If that's true, it would happen more than once; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. 
It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate. 
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice. 
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog. 
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m. 
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. 
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there. 
And I stood in the park giving signals. 
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least, at a minimum, been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities, which presumably, from our perspective, gives them the ability to decrease their own risk, and then obviously the risk to their families, the village, the country, and the world. 
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song. 
We now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding. 
And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children. 
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes, it's one degree away from the equator, it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. 
Let me tell you about that, but let me start with comfort. 
Give power to designers. 
If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things. 
Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. 
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily. 
And this is -- I see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago, where they first saw their first computers; now they have computers in their classrooms. 
We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. 
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position. 
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles. 
For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest, and the media, which mediates between the politicians and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest. 
And you might have heard how engineers proved that bumblebees couldn't fly. 
(Applause) And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America. 
And if you want to enter flow from control, you have to increase the challenges. 
Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family, his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking. 
And I ended up with a plastic nose, porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things. 
And here's how it works. 
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start, if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff, so it's important that we focus on outcomes. 
(Laughter) The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke." 
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest in their 52 choices, and they never heard about what is a money market fund. 
I was in Australia, and Belinda had cancer, and I was told she's not going to live very long. 
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses, and kids have bought in here. 
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life." 
That the place where, during an earthquake in 1954, this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly, and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. 
Okay, India. 
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases, very, very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects, and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers, can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all. 
And that's why pain becomes its own disease. 
And I'll show you a graph here. 
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe? 
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. 
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. 
Their brains and bodies will be stunted. 
They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system. 
And so, some of the things that they figured out, some of these individuals figured out; in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients; a design of a solar space probe experiment; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder -- you can tell this is a while ago; the completion of a line of furniture; and even a new conceptual model of the photon. 
And we can measure this very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects. 
My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine, and the first day it was going to be used, even Grandma was invited to see the machine. 
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. 
If in the Islamic Revolution, the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice, now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran -- women who were educated, forward thinking, non-traditional, sexually open, fearless and seriously feminist. 
And this is the most important aspect of the whole story. 
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. 
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication, we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'" And I said, "Yeah. 
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are. 
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw. 
We grew up, and we grew older. 
When you come to my website, I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. 
(Laughter) This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually. 
And the first one was no family, only friends. 
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. 
Okay, for example, that's Palestine. 
And so it brings the second question: Why should scientists study creativity? 
We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself. You could be looking there at poverty, injustice, all those sorts of things which feed terrorism. 
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive. 
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever. 
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold. 
As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need?" 
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. 
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay. 
It's called the basket cell. 
That's the consumer society, and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself. 
Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on. 
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently, seeing these as two parallel systems. 
We're a social species. 
In his new and visionary book, "New Self, New World," the writer Philip Shepherd says, "If you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world, which then appears to be other than you or separate from you, rather than the living continuum to which you belong." 
But now for the good news! 
(Mumbling) (Laughter) In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter) All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10." 
Sometimes they're really small purchases. 
And her baby will receive PMTCT, which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus. 
Notice also that on all of these graphs, the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED. 
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening. 
The graphics were just horrible. 
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth, and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day, they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us. 
She said, "The cancer center was wonderful. 
And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them, and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom. 
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. 
And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired, as I was as a kid, to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration. 
And so, what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here, and in the TED Lab, we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off. (Laughter) So we'll see you there. Thank you. 
Can you elaborate for us? 
That would mean that I was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter) But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence-based medicine. 
There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets. 
This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. 
They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through. 
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things. 
Anglo-Americans, they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them, as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers. 
It's a huge change in a very short period of time. 
It's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places, and one to two kilometers deep. 
And Negroponte says this is crazy. 
All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. 
Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be? 
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. 
Here's a piece of coal. 
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. 
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky. 
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. 
I used to join him in many of the campaigns, and you can see me here next to him. 
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. 
The physicians of the ancient world -- especially the Egyptians, who started medicine as we know it -- were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat. 
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection. 
The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images, but we need to support it. 
She came to me bloated, very pale. 
And one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been maybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids, and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day. 
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. 
Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues. 
Our parents think we're cuckoo. 
This is what happened. Now I start the world. 
What is raveling? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. 
They can't think together. 
So who gets to do it? 
She lives with her parents, her two brothers and her great-aunt. 
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys, Bacillus pasteurii, a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes, and does precisely that. 
My history wasn't right. 
Now that's a really serious problem. 
A bit like being in a washing machine. 
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up. 
Indian higher education is completely regulated. 
(Laughter) It's lighter than an iPad, it's a bit cheaper. 
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. 
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin, I once built two Hole in the Wall computers, and the children flocked there. 
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. 
They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. 
The farm's incredible. 
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. 
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago, we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies, which give the advantage to the attacker, make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in Europe. 
She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards. 
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. 
This should be the first principle of aid. 
And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems. 
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. 
(Laughter) My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg, says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter) Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. 
"First, say to yourself what you would be. 
The military, 380 billion. 
Nobody know it's happening. 
This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat, and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. 
(Applause) How do groups get anything done? Right? 
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act. 
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. 
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics, I really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function. 
I had to tell them every little detail of everything. 
And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done. 
Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average. 
So I'm just going to enter in. 
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating. 
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time. 
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s. 
But we cannot stop now. 
The discussion is all about images on the computer, data. 
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. 
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. 
That means they can be self-administered. 
So our next question then was, how are they doing this? 
(Laughter) And I was like, "Yeah, Ray. 
And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards, then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. 
He forgives the General in this image. 
Why should a conflict like Iraq have this as its fundamental signature? 
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature, extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. 
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient, a woman who was dying of dementia. 
My wife bought a flip chart. 
Let's see how we can bring people back to the process. 
It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now. 
This is us chasing it in the submersible. 
This is what it looks like now. 
That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story. 
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk. 
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group. 
Indeed, we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. 
But this was not the case. 
You just point a camera at a class, and it always looks like this. 
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from? 
For hundreds of dollars, I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns. 
But I'll watch myself. It's okay. 
But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice? 
And we didn't have the evidence for that. 
But our school at that time got a grant from the government, and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ -- and they left the programming manuals lying around. 
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament. 
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. 
A democracy could be upheld peacefully. 
It's not even mining. 
And what's the magic with them? 
1917. This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate, or something like that. 
There are superstar cooks and superstar farmers. 
So we built a three-stranded model. 
And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure, and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels. 
They're beautiful. They're bamboo. 
(Laughter) But he didn't die on Dench's birthday. 
It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously. 
It's like a drug deal. 
(Laughter) "Yes," he said. 
And I think the best way to achieve that, and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out. 
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. 
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead. 
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case." 
And finally, medicine. 
It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them. 
Anyone know where that was? Wasn't Port Arthur, no. 
I mean, the question I ask myself, why does this happen in nature? 
Sometimes you can create potholes with that. 
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it. 
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. 
Let me tell you about some of the pieces. 
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine. 
So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea, put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao." 
Most of the noises that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated were fairly prosaic in origin. 
Wait for the man with the mockingbird." 
And that's how it goes. 
It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that. 
Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive. 
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. 
And finally, they have a different model of scale, and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale. 
(Applause) Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful example of the technology. 
It's a tiny, little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles. 
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. 
But what's even more amazing, really, than this fantastic scale of progress, is that -- look at how predictable this is. 
And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic. 
And they've thought, "Oh, what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that." 
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas. 
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. 
The amount of DNA data we've sequenced has doubled every year. 
That is the sole test of survival and success. 
We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. 
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people. 
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. 
You have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply. 
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens. 
Can you do it? 
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. 
All in all, there's over 150 sites that are now tracking my personal information, most all of them without my consent. 
And of course the event itself is so recent, somewhere between history and current events, it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this, an event like this, to actually tell that story. 
Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. 
After, the building was recycled. 
(Laughter) "Do you understand what this guy wants?" 
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945. 
But I needed something else. 
Ships have automation now. 
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. 
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon, that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner. 
This only started about 150 years ago. 
Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that, are moving towards creating India as a single market. 
But what I have to do now, feeling again, what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes, of these triggers into something early on in the process, that you pick it up, not through your thinking, but through your feeling. 
What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned about a society today, you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific, of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as 
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done. 
It's in the museum in North Carolina. 
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible. 
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse. 
Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in. 
With that charter, people will move there. 
One day, while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality, I happened to see some documents that caught my attention. 
But the question is, does forgiveness and redemption replace justice? 
These are just some of the listening positions, or scales of listening positions, that you can use. 
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. 
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said, "I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. 
Babies come with this ability. 
I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked. 
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab, and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk. 
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. 
And it's very important to know where we are. 
This battery needs to be made out of earth-abundant elements. 
And also, when traveling within Africa, you've got different settings for different mobile providers. 
You can only get positive, that mental shift, if the reality is that prosperity is being built. 
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning. 
Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic. 
That's your job as a storyteller, is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal. 
But unless we start testing those intuitions, we're not going to do better. 
Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. 
As a result, this production, which had already sold out, every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people, made a decision to keep the money. 
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. 
I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year. 
And what did we get? What did they achieve? 
(Applause) So in 1885, Karl Benz invented the automobile. 
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. 
He goes, "I thought you were my driver." 
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction. 
Well, I work at the SETI Institute. 
Those are the kind of posters, let me show you. 
And again, that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space. 
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place. 
You don't have to dig deep down underground. 
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot to kill him, they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback, and took the same trip that Tamdin did. 
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. 
The other point that's worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is. 
You have regulation; information is transcribed; catalysts are made; stuff is happening. 
It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals. 
It's just very good food. 
The 10 seconds actually are because we -- I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord. 
Now you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry. 
Come here. Give me a hug. 
And we could not find 25 girls in high school. 
Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more. 
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago, a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome. 
And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides. 
And what I then found out about what's called the e-Patient movement -- I'll explain what that term means. 
Add some more. 
Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model. 
If you use wind, you guarantee ice will last. 
You manage, the village manages these warehouses. 
And they live for work, achievement and control. 
We had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual. 
(Laughter) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional. 
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman? 
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found. 
Eleven. It's not bad. 
And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on, then maybe in the next century people will be asking, why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action? 
So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there. 
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms, and in the actual print of this piece, each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. 
Japanese Mother: [Japanese] Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. 
Thank you. 
It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting, I actually imagine I'm behind the painting, it already exists, and someone's looking at it, and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. 
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. 
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it. 
What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. 
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant, by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people. 
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. 
He said it was "because they have laws and rules invented by reason." 
And then it was onto the saucer. 
When riot police have to protect parliaments, a scene which is increasingly common around the world, then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies. 
And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas. 
It's been said that, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy." 
And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. 
I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. 
Thank you. 
While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets. 
So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. 
I'll say bye for now. 
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there. 
You try out 10 variations on that one. 
There's lots of virtues of copying. 
That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations. 
And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. 
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken in different countries. 
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. 
It isn't always quite that simple, but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. 
This time, he comes down. 
When I was growing up, I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale. 
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. 
So the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001, 2002. 
And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable. 
Having put the product into practice, we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market, and one question I have for the audience today is, on the gravel roads of Limpopo, with an allowance of 50 rand a week, I came up with a way for the world not to bathe. 
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad. 
It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. 
I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. 
Are there universal laws? 
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay. 
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine, is sea level rises a little bit, the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north. 
Of course there were a few changes, but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. 
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. 
Yeah. Why. 
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. 
On the far left, you see the purple line. 
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge. 
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death: "Don't worry. The United Nations are coming." 
What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines? 
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD, which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans. 
So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you. 
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. 
Why should we care? 
It was never popular with many political leaders, especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't. 
Babcock &amp; Wilcox that make nuclear reactors, here's an integral fast reactor. 
The example, the role model, is there. 
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water -- that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go. 
The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon, he'll take the techniques of George Church and get passenger pigeon DNA, the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew, get that DNA into chicken gonads, and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs, and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. 
Some games are more about social issues, some are more about economic issues. 
Running vertically upwards, is a measure called "happy life years." 
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can. 
And so these oral histories, which we've actually been capturing already for years, are then mixed together with interviews that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld, Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, and you mix together these different players and these different experiences, these different reflection points about 9/11. 
In the modern day world, where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough, the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. 
What is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors by using technology and using design? 
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. 
And the question is: how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form? 
(Applause) I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century. 
1890, a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. 
Take the 19th century, for example. 
Not so in Italy. 
How do you do it? 
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. 
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is. 
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D. 
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests. 
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. 
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. 
We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going. 
So who's starting these companies? It's these random few people. 
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost. 
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight. 
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head." 
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now? 
Now not surprisingly, that influenced some people to think we were onto something. 
She goes home. 
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts, in the zoology department, bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy. 
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters, and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction, because of the alloys I used in the descender device. 
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult, because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post-conflict situation. 
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago. 
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days, and it's drizzling and cold and chilly, and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam. 
And we had sleep apnea at night. 
Make it hydrophobic. 
We have a serious meme running through. 
(Laughter) "You want some frozen yogurt? 
There are people at the National Science Foundation who get to say, this is the most important thing. 
So from this small, superstitious, middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother, I was zoomed into this posh, international school [in Madrid], where I was the only Turk. 
Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums, a second story building, the only second story building inside the slums. 
When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.

We're terrible at models that span 80 years. 
Now this is when something really bizarre happens. 
So, right now, please raise your hand -- down in the simulcast rooms, too, let's let everybody see who's here -- please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. 
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen. 
And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano-molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins, but there's no carbon in sight. 
We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. 
(Laughter) Then you want to know, you’re a person, you want to know how is it made. 
Man on a horse, a man on foot -- they're two different things. 
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies. 
It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. 
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002, the nearest health clinic was within three days walk. 
Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions, easy categories, because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. 
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. 
So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry. 
According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation has already saved 5.8 million lives and many millions more, people, getting diseases that would have made them very sick, even if eventually they survived. 
To be compassionate is not a joke. 
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. 
Thank you. 
All of those conversations need to be happening. 
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. 
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds. 
So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together, an interdisciplinary team of scientists, of economists, mathematicians. 
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer, about typography, even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. 
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn, it allows you to zoom in, it allows you to highlight individual structures. 
And there goes the question, especially if you ask growers, agriculturists: Why biological control? 
But you know what? I was getting work experience. 
And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea. 
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language. 
What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden? 
We have our own film school. 
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer." 
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. 
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right? 
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. 
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. 
Thank you. 
She's got big hair -- although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas. 
Can you you believe that? 
So this is what they were going to do in their trial. 
We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly. 
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working, aggregated in the red bubbles that you see, which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor. 
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent, I want some sites to understand my habits. 
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry. 
And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. 
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. 
And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch. 
And so the protest kept going. 
When we reached a million pounds, in January of 2012, I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over 100 pounds, whose lives had been changed, and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show, and then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. 
But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence, this incredible performance of Western economies. 
We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now. 
And there was a lot of terror. 
What do you want to do next?" 
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms, that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. 
Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. 
We know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body. 
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power, destroyed the tower, and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt, he scattered the people by giving them different languages -- confused them by giving them different languages. 
Country A, in 1990, had about $300 per capita GDP as compared with Country B, which had $460 in per capita GDP. 
And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right? 
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda, because in these situations, needs are everywhere, but the capacity to implement change is very limited. 
It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. 
Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it. 
It's a big labor-intensive effort. 
Neil Selinger, to me, is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act. 
(Laughter) "He merely makes you think that he does." 
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. 
A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar. 
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection. 
(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne (Singing) from Massachusetts. 
We set up a foundation. 
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. 
I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie, and I'd ship my film to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later, it would end up on my front door, which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood. (Music) I didn't have much money, but I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music) So I started shooting time-lapse photography. 
So how can we know about the project? 
I was not allowed to speak with anyone. 
So that's the focus on the construction sector. 
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse. 
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. 
Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. 
And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. 
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone? 
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities, and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day, so you can never forget that that day, you lived. 
So Osorio, good to be there with you. 
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, it's important to understand how this affects our health. 
You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature. 
It has three different kinds of strings. 
And I think the West, at least some powers in the West, particularly the United States, made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators, thinking that they were more helpful for their interests. 
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here, the output cells, the ones that send the signals to the brain, but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore. 
It's a little quirky and silly. 
They called me. 
So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on, at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing, or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is. 
So it's not necessary, thank God, that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world. 
In essence, could we "app" chemistry? 
And I'm living proof. 
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site. 
I can't wait to find out. 
And the truth is I just don't have one. 
How did this happen? 
Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity? 
So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits. 
Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote, "The Life You Can Save," which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life, it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat, steal, maim, kill, but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that with people who have so little. 
Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down. 
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. 
And what we see is a line of stars. 
(Applause) So, these are the Dark Ages. 
Like here, in Samboja Lestari, we divide that ring in groups of 20 families. 
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. 
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. 
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing, especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world, but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful. 
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations, each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share, creating a broader concept of the environment. 
There is things to see, there is the big challenge. 
It's an amazing experience every time, no matter where you go. 
We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil. 
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. 
And until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets, other than going around our own sun. 
No. 
(Laughter) RSW: Did it leak? 
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. 
It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. 
All it takes in one person to mess it up. 
There's about 10 million phage per job. 
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens -- as they were then called, finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling. 
It's a central document in Jewish history. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. 
So, this is sold as cow, but what happens when you slaughter a cow -- at least in industrial factory farming -- they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak, so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage, then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again. 
Now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century, we find a new style of technology. 
And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. 
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated. 
Now when they introduced O.C. spray in Queensland, they were really explicit. 
We have so much power today, it is up to us to figure out what to do, and that's the good news. 
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime, he wasn't the only guy searching. 
Now if you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur. 
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device. 
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫ ♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫ ♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫ ♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫ ♫ There is no great society. ♫ ♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫ ♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫ ♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫ ♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫ ♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫ ♫ There is no universal plan. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we want. ♫ 
So there are many other details like this. 
I've told you a bunch of terrible things. 
So in 1965, I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India, and I saw starvation, death, people dying of hunger, for the first time. 
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right? 
In the 1970s, the One Percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the United States. 
One night, he drank a little too much, and he robbed a cab driver -- stole 50 dollars. 
If you have the air in this room, you don't notice each individual atom. 
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms, and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms. 
You see them on the mountains up there. 
Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants -- More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas. 
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist, but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. 
That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws. 
So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes. 
Alarm: Threat imminent. 
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor. 
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area -- what does Extremadura mean? 
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. 
JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display. 
He said, "I have a dream." 
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing. 
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks. 
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim, said, "I must get the African countries involved." 
Tables: Forestry Commission. 
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know. 
E: [Spaceship noise] SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser? 
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them. 
Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All, we will need to involve all in that particular journey, and in the case of mental health, in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers. 
The State still matters. 
If what we're interested in is regional stability, Egypt is far more important. 
(Applause) This is called Hooked on a Feeling: The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design. 
And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat, despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies. 
Now sound is my passion, it's my life. 
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th, coming together locally to create networks of understanding. 
Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on. 
Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. 
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ (Applause) Thanks. 
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. 
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. 
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. 
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel. 
Mom was a nurse's aid. 
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands. 
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. 
So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage, why are we so bad at it? Why do we keep getting hurt? 
The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity. 
There's no public park in Mogadishu. 
"It will be as big as your house." 
It improves our ability to learn. 
No one wants to go on Flolan. 
(Applause) This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam, where I work as a curator. 
Only 90 days after this, arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred. 
National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. 
And he would have tremendous fun doing that. 
So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? -- one basic instinct remains. 
So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. 
I talk against violence, against terrorism. 
And what we show here is -- like, here -- very few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here, and here's the peak of the epidemic. 
The birth is almost complete. 
And they didn't even know. 
Well, if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions, and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology, I think you come to these conclusions: that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. 
I thought, well, you know, interesting, but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this. 
So, how much would this cost? 
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. 
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone, haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea, but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology -- that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story, or I was just, you know, misremembering something, but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine, 
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '06. 
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, five years of productivity growth in the workplace, but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering. 
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. 
(Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands. 
There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way. 
They cannot feed their offspring, their children, their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain, in their part of the world's ocean pyramid. 
We're all pretty much the same. 
(Laughter) Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. 
Huge effect here of Starbucks. 
And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. 
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. 
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. 
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958, Yutaka Taniyama killed himself. 
And no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question. 
If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish." 
In this sense, leather is a gateway material, a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry. 
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. 
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp. 
And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail, I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here's me sitting next to my wife -- it's the only picture I took of the entire process. 
Video: The sun is rising. 
A critique of crony capitalism is as central to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. 
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right. 
Even on my journey up here -- the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time. 
It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one. 
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. 
I started my own experiments. 
So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids. 
The really strange part is that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school, my parents made a bizarre, unusual and incredibly brave decision. 
Students learn best when they're actively practicing. 
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do: that of rebuilding a life. 
This is what Jesus asked of us. 
This is no hypothetical question. 
And I think, in no small way, that's due to one fundamental fact: they're not bound to a system of notation. 
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it. 
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. 
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. 
(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 
Will you help be their dad?" 
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school. 
We see these magnificent star nurseries, where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise. 
And I would try to reason with them and say, "Why don't we try something else? 
They had all sorts of different data formats, all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems. 
Millions of people living here, stretched over many kilometers. 
But don't give up. 
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot. 
What I do with my kids now -- I've got two, nine and seven -- is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard, looking for stuff that needs to get done. 
We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs, and also on the training pitches, which will be covered with large, flexible membranes, and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics, giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time. 
They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not "The Shawshank Redemption" types. 
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. 
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. 
When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine. 
Light is converted to electricity on them. 
And I said, "Yes." And so she said, "So, if I came out of the woods" — this is her brother and sister — "If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone." "Yes." 
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times. 
But more importantly is my kids learned to get, they learned to give. 
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now -- in our private lives, in our business lives. 
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us, if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see, then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. 
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. 
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog. 
In 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall; they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum. 
Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. 
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s -- '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. 
Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City, but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. 
(Applause) This intersection had been bland and anonymous. 
No, I'm sorry. 
The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive, dark green-gray, striated aluminum siding. 
The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action. 
Take a look at this. 
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so. 
When you get to the 1970s, which is where this chart ends, the average Briton is more than 10 times richer than the average Indian. 
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment, like those people changed the health of that bay. 
E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah. 
To my surprise, eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap, not very cheap, but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization. 
To develop liquid metal battery, I hired students and post-docs and mentored them. 
That's not what I'm saying. 
So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes. 
Complex civilizations do that, because they operate, most of the time, on the edge of chaos. 
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system. 
The forest was sparkling. 
We know how to deal with these fellows," and ignored them. 
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. 
And I use that word advisedly. 
(Applause) I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin, and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning. 
A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion." 
There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years, so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. 
And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen. 
Thank you. 
We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email. 
This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection. 
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years, why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it, in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang? 
Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message, then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. 
And if you go to these places, you meet people like this. 
Neither am I a veteran social worker. 
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. 
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head, thinking, "Wait a minute. 
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope, there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people. 
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer. 
So our politicians are limited to local politics, while our citizens, even though they see a great potential, are prey to forces beyond their control. 
And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. 
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large, sometimes global, projects. 
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. 
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects. 
They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working. 
Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others. 
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world, because they are kind of show offs. 
And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome. 
(Laughter) 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. 
Bill T. 
That's India and this is China. Size is population. 
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. 
It was then that I came across these books, and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting in global health. 
They're a form of entertainment, they're a form of art, a pride of ownership. 
And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor. 
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. 
This is affordable and can come home with you and, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can't go in your drawers; trust me, I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design. 
If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house," then the whole kind of play falls down. 
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city, and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. 
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. 
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. 
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama. 
Now people are motivated through emotions, but different people find different things motivating. 
That's a substantial amount of money. 
(Laughter) But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive. 
And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. 
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work, a few projects that we've worked on. 
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this: every 30 seconds, every 30 seconds, somewhere, someone in the world takes their own life because of depression, and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away, it might be two continents away, but it's happening, and it's happening every single day. 
They had all suffered the same tragedy. 
There's also been work done with monkeys. 
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book. 
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them, he brought a washing machine to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler. 
Or now we have a few more choices. 
How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone, but make those buildings energy efficient, and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane. 
No -- low-income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. 
I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life. 
When food is scarce, they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain, and away from other organs like the heart and liver. 
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart. 
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap. 
And it's hard for a couple of reasons. 
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system. 
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees, the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops, for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land, the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. 
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. 
CA: So they are well-motivated. 
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. 
It certainly is. 
He didn't even try to do those things. 
Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, "Why are we learning this?" 
Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness. 
So we saw how genetic information is carried. 
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?" 
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience. 
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. 
But it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it. 
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time. 
You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. 
We won the competition, and it was painful to get there. 
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. 
In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more. 
It is very tough. 
If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is, if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day, then you will have spent this day very well. 
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. 
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. 
Because everything around us is being run by these. 
And I drew it out for her. 
And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience. 
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance, to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs. 
All Brazil was shocked. 
If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
We're just starting. 
After all, even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year. 
Try and build a political settlement first. 
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough." 
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create, and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image. 
And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here, and I'll throw to Eric for the next part. 
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. 
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines, but the slope of these lines, they clustered around this value of alpha equals 2.5. 
In fact, who would like to drive a robot? 
Do you provide school lunch? 
But it gets worse. 
Give it up for that. (Applause) Halved. Halved. 
Something else is going on. 
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants, maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off. 
And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. 
Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. 
And I have to tell you, as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines, I find this strangely beautiful. 
We had plans. 
And when you think about food, the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. 
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people. 
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population. 
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision. 
Now there's Google Body browser. 
Very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles, millions of abalone, all the time, every day, every year. 
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. 
He said, "Would you like to have a go at taxiing?" 
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten. 
I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. 
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me. 
So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns. 
During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. 
Here's an example of how this can be powerful. 
This is one of our engineers. 
And the answer is yes. 
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones. 
(Applause) I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life. 
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. 
So our sense was we had to do one thing, and only one thing, instead of trying to have everything. 
You know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin? So what, right? 
The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it. 
I know I've talked about Agnes here before, but I want to give you an update on Agnes. 
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants, and their habitats. 
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture? 
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?" 
The flamingos eat the shrimp. 
And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. 
Schools can't be silos. 
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. 
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium. 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. 
A TED medley -- a TEDley. 
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday." 
First, population growth. 
It's now time for us to watch the watchers. 
She got it because she spent time with these people. 
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what! 
But they can be opened for TED people. 
What safety they had was very scant. 
Did I have somebody vote on it? Or did I punt to legal?" 
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance. 
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. 
It's just a robot. 
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. 
What do they look like? 
A few had good grades. 
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen. 
Can you imagine how small it is? 
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. 
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around, and it actually sleeps four people. 
So you walk for another hundred yards, expecting perhaps another sign, that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains." 
First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this. 
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. 
One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy, but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians. 
For 24 hours every week, no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work, where the kids need to be driven, they stop everything and they focus on their God, their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion, are nature walks. 
But that doesn't make you a slave either. 
Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. 
I call this hypersonic sound. 
I mean, it's just a losing proposition. 
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities. 
On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. 
What does that focal length do? 
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future? 
Thing only opens from the inside. 
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point, and she actually was singing that song to herself. 
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see, and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate. 
So how many hours of the day does that take? 
Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever, that would happen. 
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage. 
I was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting. 
We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern. 
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. 
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups. 
And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. 
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous, the epistemologically anxious, the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous. 
The reason that it attracted so much attention, besides the fact that it's disgusting, is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die, and a farmer died of it, and you can imagine the scandal that happened. 
You can see that there's a lot of data running around. 
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. 
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that. 
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are. 
And that's me right there in a brown coat. 
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. 
They measure very, very carefully. 
Simple business question. 
And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. 
This is where it gets weird. 
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now. 
(Laughter) So in 1967, elections were coming, things were going well in the campaign, the house was electric. 
Eighty-three percent of projects failed. 
It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, "I was here," on the top of a building. 
We needed to reduce the population growth rate. 
Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges. 
And the rest of us, the vast majority of us, struggle to get by. 
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey, but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students, have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing. 
Now, this ability to put information into categories, I find a lot of people are not very good at this. 
So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. 
We're not just talking about a fluke. 
200 years ago, a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. 
And notice that as the mycelium grows, it conquers territory and then it begins the net. 
But let me go back in time a bit. 
The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. 
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands? 
It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. 
I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. 
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see, that certainly wasn't always the case. 
We see it as a window of opportunity. 
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there. 
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment. 
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns, regardless of what other people want or recommend. 
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know, it was interesting, because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city, Dongguan, and over that time, you could see immense change in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways, but generally upward. 
And it goes on and on. 
The first move is going to be what? 
And the moment, and I mean the moment, the moment that hit me, I swear to God, it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in. 
I've got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen. 
It's molecular clockwork. 
Again, "thrilled" to learn. 
And it was a physiological response. 
It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example, we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln because of the movie. 
The first one was reaching the Pole itself. 
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from, because we can measure the gradient where it comes from, and there, we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. 
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country. 
Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks; it's having the rule of law based on private property rights. 
Now look at the one right below that. 
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer, so to get rid of these cloudy elements, what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness. 
So, look, if we could have this screen live. 
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. 
They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord. 
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. 
Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. 
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea. 
Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end, but on his last day he couldn't talk. 
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion, but when internal fertilization evolves, penises often follow. 
That's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision. 
In either case, do not settle. 
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting, though, isn't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering. 
And I'm thankful for my daughters. 
Life can be messy. 
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces. 
(Laughter) Okay, this tendency we have, this seemingly natural tendency we have, towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves, crashes head first into our modern world. 
But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. 
Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting, what do you do? 
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms, instead of just how much stuff we have? 
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar, but it was really poison and so she caused a death, people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame. 
There is no punishment on personal things like drinking. 
So in space, the Earth is very small. 
One of the young men in the room was Aden. 
And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade, with all seven mirrors. 
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. 
So let's explore how vaccines work. 
And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. 
Let me show you the living mobile phone. 
They are what we just said -- facial features, hair structure, skin color. 
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. 
But I also don't understand how it does ruin the magic. 
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us, and three generations later, I was part of a project called StoryCorps, which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces. 
And that's how it works. 
(Applause) Is there anything unique about human beings? 
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded. 
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire lifetime, depending on who you ask. 
And this is me with President Obama, showing him my Homeland Security research. 
But what I think comes next is far more interesting. 
I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same. 
You can be serious and play. 
And so, in a way, the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in, goes through the set of equations, and out comes streams of electrical pulses, just like a normal retina would produce. 
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. 
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" -- as I just said, all the stuff around us. 
That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had until very recently. 
And I love it! And so do they. 
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators. 
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty. 
So the news came, I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and I couldn't come without the support of the village, because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket. 
What lies ahead? 
You can see his current annual income -- this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today -- is quite high, 91 percent, but his retirement income is quite low. 
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors, no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world. 
It was a study to specifically ask, what's going on with women? 
The who and the why are what's important to me. 
These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. 
Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen. 
The controls work wonderfully. 
Networks, we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction, and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers. 
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others. 
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. 
In most cases, though, there was no glass. 
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. 
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave. 
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated. 
The shape is the second thing. 
They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations, and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years. 
Or you could do a moose. 
And it looks really good. 
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. 
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." 
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years. 
I would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget -- which is two one hundredths of that budget -- and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved, and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating -- I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit -- to me these are Richard's cockroaches. 
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently. 
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments. 
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life. 
Why is that? 
It had no limits. It was invincible. 
Other states have banned them. 
And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids, you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool, and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible. 
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain, when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else, it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn, it shuts all of that down. 
Watch how often the beetle dances. 
I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need. 
And maybe these healing zones can start growing, and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen. 
People must have thought I was nuts. 
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion. 
Plank number three: Tell your story. 
You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. 
Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals. 
(Laughter) Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars. 
She scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful. 
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. 
So the quantitative results were great. 
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. 
A final example: Kosovo. 
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. 
(Laughter) Yeah, I know! 
And take us through those, and introduce us to another Yemen. 
Unfortunately the government schools don't function, so children are going to private schools today. 
Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments. 
Without the Sun, there's likely to be no life on this planet. 
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?" 
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family. 
But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. 
And in that I need a surgery lexicon. 
It was not a good decision, clearly, but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister, but as George? 
But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. 
And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked. 
This high school dropout died at the age of 82, a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and founder of Schocken Books, an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House. 
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?" 
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. 
But then -- and here's the trick -- Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people, "You know what? New rule. 
And thank goodness we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time. 
Because this didn't want to be a surprise. 
But something that's not appreciated by the public is, in fact, that the experiment continues to get better, and, consequently, tends to get faster. 
But look at this. There's no privacy. 
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. 
He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill, ink, paper and his mind. 
Today, there are 14 health clinics in that area alone. 
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth. 
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. 
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are; that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me. 
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom. 
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script, and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. 
And I said to myself I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads." 
Most of these are candidates. 
And now, obviously, they have it open. 
This fish actually has high beams. 
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me, and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble. 
(Laughter) This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology. 
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. 
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this. 
For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:" "The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours, till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself." 
That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. 
It's because, for him, sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world. 
The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. 
So next time you think about a vehicle, I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new. 
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters, their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. 
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world, and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second, it would take up my entire TED talk, and I wouldn't have to say anything. 
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information, more good things happen. 
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death. 
It would be so light. 
Granted, we don't have everything in between, because some of the data is hard to get. 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) "Another time." 
You would agree with me, hopefully, there's no issue of capacity anymore. 
So you might wonder, what's the deal here? 
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity. 
(Applause) Now, let's go to the visuals. 
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what? 
This is a very important thing to know about people. 
The remains of over six million people are housed in there, some over 1,300 years old. 
Of 14 of them, only two of them are in schools. 
I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation." 
Here's an early computer. 
They're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs. 
But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. 
Religion and political cartoons, as you may have heard, make a difficult couple, ever since that day of 2005, when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world -- demonstrations, fatwa, they provoked violence. People died in the violence. 
We now have 15 sites. 
Now unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work, because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands. 
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness. 
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace, or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. 
I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work, and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden. 
Stretch the envelope." 
As I ride out, as I ride my own inner strength, and continue treatment, as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer, asking my rogue cells to behave, I want to be known not as a cancer survivor, but as a cancer conqueror. 
So all of these places have these symbols. 
MBI found 83 percent. 
They start off pretty close together. 
Third transformation, alive to dead -- but dough to bread. 
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good, at very low cost, right now." 
So how do you know if your breasts are dense? 
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about. 
I have another idea. 
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. 
You know how much trouble the children have with variables, but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion, they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it. 
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. 
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. 
But in humans, it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women, and is released by both sexes during sex. 
The fabric alone weighs two tons. 
So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. 
For me, this is about exploring human limits, about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. 
We'll do that." 
So what's the endgame? 
It's been a good ride. 
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. 
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data. 
It's evolved into something that is much subtler. 
They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others -- there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity. 
For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. 
Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter) If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product. 
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. 
So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. 
(Laughter) this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo. 
So with that in mind, this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. 
And why have we, as Americans particularly, become a nation that strives for security above all else? 
A few less. 
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking -- don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?" 
Well we understand this very well. 
That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. 
We take this same moving protocell here, and we put it in another experiment, get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system, and you'll see that in blue here, right? 
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shifts. 
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't know how you can surf with all that gear you've got on, and I don't know any women-only beaches." 
So, now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk. 
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem, nothing like that happens. 
So they know everything. 
This is a European society with literate records, so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation. 
Thank you very much. 
I thought I must tell you this. 
And I don't know about all of you, but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once. 
They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did, to come up with their own lists. 
We'll have spatial computing. 
And as a result it's a very tolerant community, which is different, I think, than something like this, which is in Schaumburg, Illinois, where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that. 
The Earth was struck by an asteroid, a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. 
And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style. 
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and it's called "Floating Memories." 
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care -- I'm not even going to try. 
I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view. 
I think this is an amazing development. 
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. 
(Applause) This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given. 
But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning, about a billion people on Earth -- or one out of every seven -- woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup. 
And apparently it smells like bacon. 
Here, I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries, who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society. 
We organize the existence of people. 
People were trying to do them. 
The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country. 
solidifying into surface, molded by fire. 
If they died, at what age and what year? 
And I hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image, which is water. 
The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. 
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet. 
(Applause) Africa is booming. 
Here's a way of transporting water. 
Isn't that a great book? 
So actually, how can we do it? 
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further. 
And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life, and degrades rapidly at room temperature. 
I have. 
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future. 
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000, it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time, was listed as a threatened species. 
(Laughter) My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race. 
And the only fishery left -- and it is a commercial fishery -- is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right, where there used to be prawns. 
Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste, or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby. 
I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. 
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. 
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name, especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. 
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him. 
This is at about 60 feet or 18 meters, depth. 
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature. 
Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them. 
We have no water whatsoever. 
The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters. 
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore. 
Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter. 
I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets, we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people." 
This software can also be networked between domes. 
So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina, which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball, or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex. 
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. 
Of course he knew. 
But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years is that you actually don't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren't obviously not our universe. 
This is all natural. This is all natural. 
JA: But that is about to change. 
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. 
And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century. 
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company. 
We don't see it that way in the United States, but you see it that way. 
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun. 
Different ways of looking at her models, at her statistics, different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her. 
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language? 
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture. 
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you and protect you from doubt or change. 
Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion. 
And this is a perspective. 
But nothing, of course, in nature is totally perfect, so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in. 
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. 
Here's the latest virus we've found, in a file called Server.exe. 
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it. 
And these seeds will be able to germinate, we believe, with many of the species, in thousands of years, and certainly in hundreds of years. 
And we are always being tempted up to our neck. 
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he's got to lose weight, so do I! 
And with my short time today, I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition. 
I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process. 
It's morning rush hour. 
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over, and you’ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper. 
So, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up. 
Here at TED there are great opportunities. 
He started a press. He started photoengraving. 
We developed some other technology called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning: we’re going to be building a beautiful, little, small version of this -- unmanned, super deep -- for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. 
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world, because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males. 
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality -- those that are left out, those that feel angry, those that are not participating. Globalization has not been inclusive. 
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. 
And so we have a choice, it seems to me. 
(Laughter) Man: Your father, is he alive? 
That's right -- when you have a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent. 
And it's going to change the world as we know it. 
She's a high school student. 
We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid. 
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head. 
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. 
He described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as Everest. 
I'm a performer. 
So jobs, health, and clean government. 
This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September. 
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. 
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place. 
And I get, over time, bored by them. 
I made the decision to move to the U.S. 
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players. 
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility." 
You can't really directly sense the world around you. 
We must course-correct. 
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country. 
Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom, so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids, as long as they follow the scripts, our kids will get educated. 
Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right, and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases. 
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians. 
We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn, and this is one of our first projects that we did, and we took an underutilized, pretty dingy-looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend. 
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. 
Astrolabes have an incredible history. 
I thought a lot about, What was I put on Earth to do? 
Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture, you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be. 
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause, and now let me turn to you so the moment the image, or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting, then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so, see. 
It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour. 
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. 
I'll show you how. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me? 
And they would see a coral head, maybe 10 feet away, and start moving over toward that coral head. 
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials. 
We can build on their wisdom. 
CA: 60,000. 
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. 
There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water. 
And since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways, I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context. 
And as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input." 
I knew that I was where I was supposed to be, and I knew that I was home, and I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day, but I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come up and tell you that you've been an incredibly important person in my life, and I'm going to miss you. Good luck." 
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos. 
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH, that "sh" sound. 
They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. 
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. 
And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. 
We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long, long time. 
So at the end, I had a settlement with them. 
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. 
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan. 
I got interested in gene sequencing. 
As I went back, every time I went, I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married. 
That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization. 
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus, but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species, the Neanderthals, lived in Eurasia. 
I feel so fortunate. 
So roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice, not merely as a political choice. 
Now this idea is not new. 
We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. 
But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight. 
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes; you know what the action is? The action is: The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside. 
People with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart, they're actually sometimes quite helpless. 
I went to Sierra Leone, and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village. 
And then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum. 
(Laughter) Anyway, as you'll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies They didn't get very far, obviously. 
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. 
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine. 
And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. 
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there. 
And remember, the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth, so if an election official wants to find out how you voted, they will not be able to. 
We selected this for the research. 
In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. 
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. 
My base of operations is in the U.S., but let's start at the other end of the map, in Kyoto, Japan, where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research 15 years ago. 
This seems most likely. 
And then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them. 
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water, and whatever active ingredient you want to put in, and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved, just immune boosters. 
It is vital that we do so. 
(Music) (Applause) I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. 
Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure. 
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do? 
This is how I remember what I need as a chemist. 
The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown. 
There's not much of it left. 
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. 
I'll take your picture just for trying. 
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants. 
(Laughter) So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics, and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter) So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana. 
There was a reason for that; it was me. 
When I read something, it will read in my voice. 
Okay. 
She's an inspiration. 
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work, but we should not lose the chance in this generation, in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America, with other people working with us around the world, to create global institutions for the environment, and for finance, and for security and for development, that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples, our desire to bind the world together, and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist. 
I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left? 
And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to. 
The chromosomes line up. 
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. 
And why is he building a thing like this? 
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. 
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body, so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started. 
Baseline levels are near zero, without some stimulus to cause its release. 
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down. 
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff. 
One is a flash of white light. 
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. 
I'm very lucky, because he's better than all the other children. 
But he was convinced of this. 
And then Curtis Cooper got it back. 
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F. 
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers. 
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need. 
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy. 
Only 20 years later, between 1920 and 1930, almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the United States. 
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem. 
So for 11 years, I conformed. 
Even though it has delivered many benefits, it is based on a crazy idea -- the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet. 
Now that was, ironically, and very befittingly, the way we found his grave. 
You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian. 
We are proud of it. 
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. 
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place, and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle, but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia. 
If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things. 
He's five years old. He's not going to understand this." 
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have. 
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother. 
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult. 
(Applause) I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another, in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed, such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders, the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe and so on. And within the last decade or two, archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses. 
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer. 
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups, we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species -- kind of like caterpillars and butterflies -- except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring, and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path. 
And then when it's time to go, a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go." 
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers? 
It's the entire history of my family in a single game. 
That's important and it's an important shift. 
From the Taliban's point of view, that was their number one mistake last time. 
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said. 
If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we've been hearing amazing things about, it's very, very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions. 
Living in Africa is to be on the edge, metaphorically, and quite literally when you think about connectivity before 2008. 
Where are we? 
What about longevity? 
In fact, she had aged a lot. 
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe. 
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. 
So, we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. 
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology. 
Here's the problem facing Homer. 
So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. 
There's no poison. There's no pollution. 
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank, but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges. 
This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala. 
In the developing world it's much lower. 
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that. 
I met her last October in India, and she grew up in a conservative environment. 
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell? 
This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. 
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause) BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees? 
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name. 
It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job, but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos of high-tech sensors, computers, and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. 
These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. 
(Laughter) So something interesting had to be going on. 
Here you go. 
The rest of the time they're delocalized. 
"People do stupid things. 
That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. 
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves, where we're okay with who we are, because when we get honest, we see that we all struggle and we all suffer. 
I have asked her to translate for me. 
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in. 
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure, smoking is just the opposite. 
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work." 
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process. 
After six months, it was time to go home. 
Imagine the ocean without fish. 
How many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star? 
And in fact, it probably won't. 
And it was right-heart failure. 
This is European space agency Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water, we have ice. 
Just a bit too ornamental. 
They give rise to the trees, they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. 
So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation of why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk. 
And blowflies just can't help themselves. 
They died of AIDS last year. 
I said to my team, "Let's get out of here." 
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. 
And they were: No songs, no "I want" moment, no happy village, no love story. 
It's about retelling the story of the poor, and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity, validates a partnership relationship, not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. 
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. 
Your robe gives it away." 
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention. 
And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working. 
(Laughter) "I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer. 
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning. 
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff. 
When you're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions, when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want, that's an institution-as-enabler world. 
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. 
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list, talking about income distribution, and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution, can be downright threatening. 
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months, up from zero when we started. 
And compared with the official forecast, that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025, which is half of what we've been paying lately, that will save 70 billion dollars a year, starting quite soon. 
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds and only 300 possess a penis. 
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design. 
If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up, you have a puddle. 
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions. 
If -- Ouch is right! -- If you see this, and you're a bacterium, this is like your worst nightmare. 
And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. 
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. 
And you know, when you educate a boy, his family tends to have fewer kids, but only slightly. 
There are real concerns there. 
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, because there's nothing for the drug to bind to. 
This could be us. 
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. 
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner? 
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. 
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production, to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. 
After eight years of rejection, I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City. 
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. 
What we do know is that the world has accelerated. 
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together, and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play, we can transform Bulgaria for the better. 
What's in yours? 
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity. 
And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people, without reference to the structure of the population. 
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility. 
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. 
For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. 
Their reality consists of objective entities, like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. 
When we look at pictures like this, they take our breath away, in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide. 
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?" 
These aren't financial stats; this is culture. 
There is some good successes. 
The fourth foundation is authority/respect. 
But now I want to actually also question that. 
Here is a pest, devastating pest, a spider mite, because it does a lot of webbing like a spider. 
It's breathable. It creates color through structure. 
I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. 
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare. 
But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all. 
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. 
At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment. 
So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. 
That's a tall order. We have to work at it. 
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. 
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. 
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations, his logic, his fallacies. 
I had to sit down with my daughter and say, "Here's the situation." 
So in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. 
I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest, but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature, and which doesn't get priced by the markets. 
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said, "Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of flat, thick safe ice." 
We're very afraid. 
I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders, and I looked very deeply into slave-based businesses because this is an economic crime. 
These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data -- entertainment titles in PC Data in December, right up there with "John Madden Football," which thrills me to death. 
You know, these economists, they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow. 
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. 
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together. 
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside. 
So what we want is studies in real human people. 
We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail. 
But if you have to have an operation, what you really want is a minimally invasive operation. 
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. 
She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together. 
It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit, and it all connecting. 
Larger images, I started to run marathons. 
But there's a roadblock that you can't get past. 
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. 
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know, that we counted all the child deaths, even if we didn't do anything about it. 
They do not have good enough infrastructure. 
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice! 
It was very James Bond. 
(Applause) The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics, dating back to at least before Adam Smith. 
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. 
And not only that, but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there -- life that could be very different from life that we find here on Earth. 
Two years ago, I was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program. 
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. 
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff, what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous, and I think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science. 
Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened, so they take them to Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. 
In other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. 
And we should begin by reimagining leather. 
We dropped them gently in. 
It begs the question: shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies? 
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. 
All right. "Starsky and Hutch," arguably, yes. 
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest, and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it, this may never have happened. 
How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car? 
And I'm trying to start it as a movement. 
This is just like video conferencing today. 
I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference. 
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules. 
Everyone's listening. We're responding. 
How aware are you of things going on around the world, the seasons changing, people around you? 
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see. 
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. 
And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids, driven by algae or by the leaves at the end, by the most, most powerful parts of the plants, by the roots. 
The Pharaoh got wind of this -- This is true, right off the Internet. 
If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle, and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face and you might sob.

The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety. 
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin. 
You can hear this distribution under that complaint. 
And I just finished a couple of months ago. 
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words, and they were totally inadequate to the task. 
We came back to our pile, it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms, and the color changed to a light form. 
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce, or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising, they were all right -- they were just wrong in time. 
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously? 
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it. 
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries. 
(Laughter) There were plenty of role models all around us. 
But this is a promising era in the Muslim world. 
So then, we think we can do that. And my first question doing this -- or one of my questions doing this -- was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA? And I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. 
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni, which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it. 
We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see, and when everything is ready, when you know what is the best recipe and the best form, you start working with the community. 
You know? What do you do here?

Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons, very similar features, glaciers. 
Now, part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature, obviously, as the bacteria do their work. 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. 
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world, here's a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. 
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products, when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out. 
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together. 
He's invited all the best people. 
I think collectively we can build a global community. 
So the first is, when you've got one of these devices going, such as this contract to write everyday or pay, it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control. 
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it. 
And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. 
Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? 
The extinctions still go on. 
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy. 
But the process is very expensive and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe. 
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in English and then in Japanese. 
Make a beautiful website, but first give us the unadulterated data, we want the data. 
He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I, we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud. 
But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston, South Carolina and then in Denver, Colorado. 
There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them. 
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. 
And we can produce from this, believe you me, several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. 
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. 
But of course, as you're probably aware, even in adulthood, people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds, how often they do it and how accurately. 
So every 10 years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. 
It's a wonderful, amazing thing. 
And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. 
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. 
All right. 
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas. 
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics, such as this 10th century derivation of proofs. 
So what you were getting was this: Your name here presents: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. 
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.

And what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. 
I've learned that there's no boundaries, and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense. 
Heart rates are slower; you live longer; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower, etc. 
The point about this slide is actually the bottom. 
So, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time. 
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. 
Will government change?

These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar, and they say the most important factors are: "Increased age at first marriage, increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force." 
Right? It's pretty big. 
If you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch, you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns. 
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. 
I met him at a 46664 event. 
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today? 
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool, physically filling an enclosure, a mold, in whatever shape you want to get. 
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years. 
They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever. 
More generally, I want to tell you something about behavioral economics. 
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area, and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter. 
You know, in working on this science for many years, I kept wondering, "What will be its first killer app?" 
This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry. 
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. 
So we assume that the Internet is a border-busting technology. 
We understand it so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. 
Observe from a distance, but do not join the fray. 
So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal? 
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. 
Most of the educational games do not. 
In 1931, she produced California's first community-based marine protected area, right next to the biggest polluting cannery, because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone, the ocean needed a place to grow from, that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed, and she wanted to provide that seed. 
This is a physics and information theory term. 
(Laughter) They have kids of their own, and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people, so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein, their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once. 
I visit her in the hospital. 
So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long, and I feel like I should stop here. 
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany. 
Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court. 
See, crucial point here: math is not equal to calculating. 
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so it was a lot harder to find. 
And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins -- when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. 
And put your project in that context. 
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating. 
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present. 
When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl.

Lorna Sass came and donated books. 
This is a really easy problem. 
They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic: the Santee Alley demographic. 
And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister." 
I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city. 
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change. 
Hands up, please. 
When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom, it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. 
So then people said, well, how far will it go? 
E: What's the matter? 
Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. 
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect. 
Mortality is not going down, it's going up. 
There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate -- plants and animals both. 
That makes a difference. 
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast. 
I need to know you personally. 
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students who are soldiers in territory that owns them. 
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. 
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods. 
We are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies. 
And we thought, let's make people do it and see what happens. 
And design is responsible for this experience. 
And the point of these is they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness, but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. 
A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party, which are cities. 
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that, because the heads on ships -- that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening -- are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it. 
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch. 
I see this plus sign. 
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system. 
One answer would be: because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly -- that's a kind of physical science argument. 
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff. 
But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality. 
This is the first temporary building made out of paper. 
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure. 
What if compassion is also good for business? 
I've done some tests. 
(Applause) So, I've known a lot of fish in my life. 
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. 
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei. 
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. 
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are: how smart and how much they have to say. 
All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. 
The bigger the crowd, the more potential innovators there are. 
Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. 
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. 
For me, it began as I was approaching my third act, my 60th birthday. 
It's not a happy thought, but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. 
And I stood there on the edge of the lake, and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself, just do this slowly. 
Come to me and tell me what it is. 
I can digitize all these. 
Thank you very much. 
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. 
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say, that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act. 
Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. 
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. 
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan. 
And because of the social connections, Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school, or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China -- there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news. 
He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. 
"Will you help be their dad?" 
I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period. 
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. 
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume. 
Cabinet ministers would admit this. 
My drawings got to star in the movie too. 
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society. 
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available. 
Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly? 
It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. 
In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. 
Folks, I'm petrified. 
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment. 
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. 
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?" 
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs, some 8,000 miles from the drill site. 
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. 
Nobody, literally nobody. 
And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance. 
Okay. 
The adult literacy rate in China is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in India. 
You have, in effect, lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. 
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. 
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake? 
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm. 
(Applause) Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn. 
I think it's our collective intelligence. 
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast. 
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy. 
More years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined. 
And it's not that he's not eating, it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. 
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there. 
These are virus-assembled nanowires. 
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth. 
(Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n. 
We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. 
So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself. 
And of course, the Swiss can be divided into two general categories: those who make small, exquisite, expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small, exquisite, expensive objects. 
So I'm not going to go. 
It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. 
When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to, all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. 
But to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and production, or drug discovery and manufacturing. 
First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd. 
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass. 
And suddenly the institution, once again, turns into a listening experience. 
But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. 
In fact, in the area where she comes from, more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. 
SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited. 
An extraordinary set of telescopes. 
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this. 
We tend to view them -- and the popular press aids and abets this view -- as chemical imbalances in the brain, as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere. 
The women in Bosnia were being raped. 
You might think that that's not a surprise. 
The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter? 
When we think about cognition, we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem. 
And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. 
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. 
Already that's fallen to about 11. 
However, there is an underlying argument about logistics, which has driven so much of this debate. Right? 
And you can think of different formats. 
I mean, they're Newtonian objects. 
But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult. 
Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world. 
And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument. 
How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. 
Ubuntu: I am because of you. 
(Video) (Crying) Marlin: There, there, there. 
Then, significantly more often, does a Neanderthal match the European rather than the African. 
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing. 
This is Kanzi. 
And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just, look at that little boy there. 
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived. 
Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light. 
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. 
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to. 
You know, it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention, a student can get one grade level higher. 
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC. 
And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone. 
This is not the common man. 
But the truth is that, on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. 
My foster father's small act of love reminded me of my father, who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry, even if he was starving. 
It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities, therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city. 
It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed. 
The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom, because they had a long life. 
I was taught that when I was eight years old. 
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. 
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them, because I wanted to have this information. 
They would be really useful." 
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left. 
I know, I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute, but I got this hard thing. 
And your job today is to be skeptical. 
But what's more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you're eating. 
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one? 
There's certainly no quick security fix. 
And the answer seems to be yes. 
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. 
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. 
Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions. 
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed. 
The computer found several texts -- two of them are shown here -- that have very unusual patterns. 
What was that? 
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data." 
That was his biggest fear. 
There is something very restorative about nature, and it's part of how we are tuned. 
In fact, it already is. 
So how do we ask this question? 
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet. 
The one I want to show you -- after we get them to make the movies, we have a night where we show the movies to the community. 
That is the big question. 
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. 
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. 
We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war. 
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. 
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist. 
So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well, but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads, called "related searches." 
(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau. 
So all we've got to do is take that DNA, put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus, and put it into neurons. 
Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars. 
And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams. 
We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. 
In the next couple of years, the hypertext community didn't recognize him either. 
Some of you might have heard of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine, but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Picasso's studio in Paris in the 1930s. 
They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere. 
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place." 
He's about to head home, and look what happens. 
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very rough terrain area. 
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it. 
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms -- so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. 
And you become a partner building the rollercoaster, yeah, with sound, as you actually take the ride. 
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. 
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough. 
Don't get too attached to him. 
She found a job, she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. 
That's a Boeing 707. 
I do wish, with their budget, that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student, who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin. 
(Applause) We are here today because [the] United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. 
So, a solution to the problem, then, would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells, and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain. 
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this. 
Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present. 
Right? So the question is, do you want that photo? Yes or no. 
It takes what we know, and it twists it. 
Another world is possible. 
In fact, though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice, we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. 
So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing? 
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to. 
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. 
We opened up our talks to the world, and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas, and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. 
And along the way, please take time to smell the flowers, especially if you and your students grew them. 
This is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away, and everybody making millions and billions of dollars. 
It caused immense celebration in the control room. 
And stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food. 
Because with that beautiful photo, maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time. 
They are really excelling. 
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan? 
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared. 
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is, and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right. 
You know, no power required. 
And what happens next? 
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him. 
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. 
You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it. 
And you can eat something new everyday. 
And then now, finally in education, we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. 
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin. 
I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. 
Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years, and has happened many times in our history. 
This is a global experience. 
And in 2007 alone -- and I'm sure there are more recent figures -- something on the order of 1.3 million pages were translated into English alone. 
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published. 
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself. Thank you. 
Hockey is a game. But really, was this a game? 
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance, or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression, or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies, including those whose motto might be "don't do evil," to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class. 
One problem that's happening now is, although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon, depression and anxiety are rising. 
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to, because that's wishful thinking, and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination, and we can't procrastinate on something this important. 
Those aphids secrete some sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew, and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. 
Now, Martin Luther King, on the eve of his death, gave an incredible speech. 
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it. 
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff. 
You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap. 
And when my ritual began, this very voluble patient began to quiet down. 
But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do -- was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. 
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside, and the other one is exploring our interior being. 
And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active. 
And of course they don't. 
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. 
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution." 
I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it. 
On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors. 
And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement, we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things, that something I do here actually does matter in Africa, that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. 
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. 
Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States -- leading cause of death -- and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol. 
(Laughter) It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures. 
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. 
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. 
(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. 
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive. 
Do they make sense? 
Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate. 
like it is in the movie. 
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some. 
Now, see this strange, underwater, coral reef-looking thing? 
CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. 
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago, we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past. 
How many people times how much water. 
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread. 
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere. 
To me, thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush -- one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. 
Is that all there was?" 
You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. 
But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin. 
I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India, Pakistan, from Britain, and I said, "Wow." Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. 
(Laughter) And those sweet potatoes became part of me. 
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development -- it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence. 
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything's going right, rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong, like so many of you. 
So he's saying, "I've got this problem." 
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want, where happiness does not cost the earth. 
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier. 
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum. 
What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on. 
These are only two countries. 
I don't know if my parents really believe that, but I didn't want to prove them wrong. 
He talks like this now. 
We had fashion designers, installation artists, models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers, all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. 
All those in favor, raise your hands. 
And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. 
Knowledge is power. 
Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. 
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict. 
A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. 
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around, and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter) So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around, and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance, and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer, a step-counting system, to find their way back home. 
Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras. 
And most of them couldn't say. 
Force them to help others. 
We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi. 
But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual. 
This is not fiction, nothing at all. 
What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know. 
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. 
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. 
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades. 
There's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells. 
I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints. 
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium. 
We need to begin from the position that our knowledge, our power, our legitimacy is limited. 
We need to put ourselves into boy culture. 
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly. 
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first. 
And let me show you, what does public expenditure -- rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute? 
Yet the question wouldn't let go of me. 
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. 
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room. 
Now look, you're a pioneer of open education. 
And that, in fact, these connections were vast and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other. 
I've tried to encourage young girls. 
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door. 
Will you have a go for me? 
And so we started talking about this. 
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that. 
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. 
He was tortured, brutally tortured to death. 
What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage, a medicinal plant on one side, a non-medicinal plant on the other side, and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant. 
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying, inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way. 
The biosphere is the size of the Earth. 
Well, it conducts electricity. 
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people, who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list, but I was determined to bring them to India, so -- a lot of them were in India. 
And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists, and they also make really, really good stage actors. 
And then I asked myself the question. 
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet? 
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution. 
As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed. 
Two thirds are not saving now. 
It turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2. 
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. 
So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do. 
So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this. 
This is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people, and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face. 
♫ Young man, you were surfin' along ♫ ♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫ ♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod ♫ ♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫ ♫ You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫ ♫ And there'd better not be a next time ♫ ♫ They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ You're depriving the bands ♫ ♫ You are learning to steal ♫ 
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge. 
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis. 
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals. 
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right. 
But we won't be able to take care of any of those things if we don't solve the real problem we have in Mexico first. 
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program, and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership, only to end up being tortured by their heroes. 
Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well. 
It matters because this is a democracy. 
That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. 
And it's a very easy question. 
But in fact, they're growing faster. 
Even at its best, dieting is a waste of time and energy. 
However, I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege. 
Well, some people did. 
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. 
Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible. 
And we didn't think he'd be in town then, so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. 
If you don't have open spaces, you've got to go there and open spaces. 
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs -- to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. 
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. 
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuaries are located. 
But I'll tell you, here today, that I'm committed to seeing this project done, to see if, within this decade, we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes ... 
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. 
(Laughter) A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want. 
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally -- spell it for me. 
We were involved with several experiments. 
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. 
I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks. 
And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. 
I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter. 
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. 
Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world? 
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond. 
The first issue: Imagine a potential enemy announcing they're building a cyberwar unit, but only for their country's defense. 
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore. 
I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know that I've never really been in control. 
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. 
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. 
(Music) They had to be larger than life. 
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. 
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. 
By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago? 
And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes," back in 2005. 
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. 
Good morning everybody. 
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. 
You can derive many ideas from that. 
There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but that electronic eyes can perceive. 
How do you start? 
Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here, and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter, plant litter. 
They begin with a question. 
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different. 
Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. 
One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here. 
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that's the voice I want. 
Technology has a role to play. 
Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front, it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate, and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. 
And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. 
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious. That's obvious. 
I was 26 years in the corporate world, trying to make organizations profitable. 
Thank you. 
So I'll give you four. 
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. 
Or in 2010, the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband, who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year." 
In my mind, I was actually a knight trying to help science move along. 
Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this, is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. 
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. 
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living. 
They begin to chant. 
I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization. 
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No." 
So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes. 
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. 
Thank you. (Applause) Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes. 
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. 
I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. 
And so these are questions like, "How can a democracy balance freedom and security?" 
So my view is: Be optimistic. 
So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery. 
All right, those of you, I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage. 
When I first learned the statistics, I was pretty stunned at how bad things are. 
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. 
Words like "philanthrocapitalism," and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur," and "venture philanthropy." 
The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places. 
It may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them. 
You've got to remember that in this time of year, 1993, what was considered a successful animated picture was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin," "Lion King." 
It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. 
I'd like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell, who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland. 
(Laughter) So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost. 
Thank you. 
I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist. 
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high. 
And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot. 
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. 
Tesla became the man who lit the world, but this was only the beginning. 
Every child has the right to a family, deserves and needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient. 
This just didn't happen a couple of times. 
Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person, and neither does mine. 
But this is actually a talk about, okay -- (Laughter) — but this is actually a talk about fission. 
But then her sister started working the system. 
So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught, they do not have a cadaver dissection lab. 
Now, retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism, and not without reason; you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green. 
"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?" 
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. 
Because it's actually not that hideous. 
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? 
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing. 
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb, and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing. 
Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year. 
And Congress did something. 
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening. 
And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. 
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to. 
Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there's nowhere else to turn that they're sending them to us. 
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. 
Take a look at these. 
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. 
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it. 
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles. 
I know your head is spinning from all this stuff. 
Didn't know I had one." 
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world, but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do. 
And surveillance changes history. 
And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system, which cleans, cooks, cools and pasteurizes these materials, while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. 
Our team, befittingly I think, named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time, Johannes Kepler, and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out, find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy, and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. 
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community. 
They can be shocking or silly or soulful. 
Molecules are competing for stuff. 
And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. 
And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything. 
Flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos, upload them, share them over the Web and so forth. 
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. 
Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. 
And they're rushing around all stressed out. 
The Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning. 
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain, and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. 
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games, there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest: cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. 
And they thought that they clarified the issue, because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. 
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old, I still will say something. 
While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. 
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. 
Well you can see where this is going. 
They are the U.S.A., other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. 
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. 
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something." 
My goal of the design is not when it's completed. 
For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods. 
Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible, that incompatibility can persist over long periods. 
business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business? 
In America, before the motor vehicle, transportation depended entirely on the urban horse, which dropped, without restraint, 25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine. 
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D. 
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people, and they've done all the work, and I'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together. 
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing. 
My friend looks at me totally blankly. 
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. 
I can also make him spin. 
And you can have a hundred million of these homes, and it's great because they suck carbon. 
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system, so we said, "Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?" 
We are there to take pride and insist on respect. 
That stuff's cool." 
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. 
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site, Kenyan Pundit. 
In the side effect profile, etc., you want to see where those genes are turned on. 
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms, at first it's very bizarre. 
So, we get climate change. 
But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. 
Come on, you're thinking. 
It's a sensitivity to the physical environment, the ability to pick out patterns in an environment -- derive a gist. 
Use of freshwater. 
This is a problem. 
So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth, that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development: infrastructures, airports, highways, bridges, things like that. 
And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight: thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see. 
That's my greatest hope. 
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir. 
You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read, what kinds of places they like to travel to, and what kinds of food they like to eat. 
For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered. 
And so what is this? How does this work? 
As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls? 
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology. 
That didn't happen to me. 
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation. 
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one? 
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. 
We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed, and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. 
About seven years ago, they faced extinction, because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier, and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village. 
And the second point, making the case that kids can really change the world. 
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world. 
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. 
Yep. 
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. 
Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. 
And the reason why is this: Traffic is getting worse. 
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. 
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme. 
We have problems. 
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this. 
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC. 
We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play. 
You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. 
This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. 
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well, because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors, and they know what motivates them to make change. 
And here's an example. 
So welcome to my home. 
This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings. 
And one was called "Ballet Slippers." 
It will bring skills and learning and reading. 
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process. 
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence, which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 -- it's a quite amazing development which had happened. 
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. 
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils. 
Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time, they could put more kids through the machine in a day. 
Imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts, when the financial markets recognize that, to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control, the oil and coal industries are finished. 
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. 
Lunch is like the recess for work. 
It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know, currently the largest prime number we know, is 2 ^ 57,885,161. 
I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly -- though not exclusively -- who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table. 
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them. 
But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks. 
Let's start with technology. 
Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country. 
There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller. 
It doesn't radiate. 
And yet, even in the best-resourced countries, for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent of affected people don't receive these interventions. 
We are at war with a new form of terrorism. 
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad. 
I was very happy to hear that. 
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster. 
And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool, because knowing how many fish are there is really critical. 
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. 
Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news. 
Why are they engaging with cyberspace? 
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout. 
So, those are the two clips I'm going to show. 
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically, of the background galaxies. 
You can add a third dimensionality to the film. 
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees. 
What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you. 
And also, the clone, Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. 
He doesn't have that same self-worth. 
Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain. 
And see now, we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings, but we often don't have so much material. 
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential. 
So over the course of two semesters, the Fall and the Spring, the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space. 
And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors, had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes. 
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing, which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant. 
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot. 
♫ Gimme my damn data ♫ ♫ I want to be an e-Patient just like Dave ♫ ♫ Gimme my damn data, cuz it's my life to save ♫ Now I'm not going to go any further. 
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense -- ideas would get together there. 
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them." 
Fireworks displays, the rules of games, the smell of perfume: no. 
And it had to be run in a quite new way. 
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. 
Do not fear what has blown up. 
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. 
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there. 
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment, and made available on web, call-center and franchise physical offices, for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. 
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry. 
Now you know the lists I'm talking about. 
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time. 
[Hawaiian chant] When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. 
The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. 
And then I explored what was behind that; it was about changes in the climate -- climate shocks, changes in the weather. 
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light. 
Thank you. 
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly? 
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. 
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet, but you could make it so that DVDs were always available, and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. 
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. 
And you know what happened to Muti? 
And they can feed that information back to their subscribers, but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam! 
It's, of course, limited by science, by technology. 
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees. 
Now, how far does this analogy go? 
I was asked to design the building, because the theme of the expo was environmental issues. 
For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms. 
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. 
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man. 
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along, Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again. 
But after that, I decided to work on the spirit. 
These techniques revolutionized this art. 
And they're labeled by color right now, by language. 
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems, ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly, who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it. 
Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. 
They come in a lot of different shapes. 
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria, which within just the last several years still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide. 
This would have been fine. 
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough. 
We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments, how many of them we create, how many of them we acknowledge, how many of them we pay forward, and how many of them we say thank you for. 
Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood, and she had hand washed laundry for seven children. 
It's the sum total of his life, all the things that had happened -- the bad things, the good things. 
So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. 
That's a technical term. 
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, "Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk." 
Let me show you one more. 
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. 
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator, and you send it off to a mid-sized village in Africa, it will work great for a year or two years, and then something will go wrong and it will break, and it will remain broken forever, because you don't have a whole system of spare parts, and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment. 
Thank you. 
Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people. 
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. 
Another, which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on, is that compassion enhances our immune system. 
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating. 
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. 
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues. 
When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, "That's what I want to be." 
And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned, depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years. 
And the difference then, they perceive as a loss. 
In fact, it could save countless lives. 
It's this brain which makes this reflex. 
But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom. 
I grew up amongst those animals. 
I don't need to go into that. 
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. 
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals. 
Two months later something incredible occurs. 
There it ends. 
You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. 
It really impairs cognition. 
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe? 
Because the auto body has only, say, 14 parts, instead of 100, 150. 
But instead, I go out and I find things. 
I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one. 
We had the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. 
I think back to my father. 
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. 
But I added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions. 
(Laughter) But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea? 
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. 
So having seen this danger to the economy, I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem. 
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. 
Now if we look at the economic imperative here, this isn't just about compassion. 
DK: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. 
Like twice over. 
When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family. 
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother." 
He called these, "massively fatal discontinuities," meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years. 
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. 
And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting. 
Is this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?" 
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface, you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal. 
And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. 
But what does it mean? 
Around the same time, I was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in China -- with another thousand college girls. 
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. 
People come from all over the world to learn, and then they go away and plan exactly how they're going to collect these seeds. 
We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. 
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark. 
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music, within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine. 
But first we have to know. 
You have Google, we have Baidu. 
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off, reality television has taken hold. 
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession. 
Is democracy bad for economic growth? 
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power. 
It's bad history. 
Why does this matter? 
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using non-toxic materials." 
No way! 
And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data. 
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different. 
We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent, and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship. 
Does that really explain what we're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays? 
It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion. 
I mean, this is one vision of it. 
He can now cut through tough animal hide. 
And then she came back to the United States and was on break, Christmas break. 
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex. 
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark. 
Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade, right, this epiphany of Tom's. 
And that's why what I'm excited about, and what I think is under-reported, is the significance of the rise of online video. 
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water, and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers. 
(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up? 
Let me introduce him. 
In fact, here's another one. 
So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon, genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon, and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on. 
I say the answer is yes. 
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. 
This young man is picking organic vegetables. 
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. 
So if you take the average commute time in America, which is about 50 minutes, you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have, that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day. 
When I saw that, I went back and I wrote on Facebook. 
So a tremendous fund of knowledge despite, again, that so many people told her not to do it, it was too expensive. 
And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients, most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. 
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era. 
Many in my generation -- because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -- were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes -- (Laughter) who were going to go out and save the world. 
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue, and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. 
Wow. Wow. (Applause) Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that. 
Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor," and it was okay to talk about it. 
The family mission statement was on the wall, and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?" 
The example I started out with about lions hunting, that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. 
So here's what I want you to do. 
And then I'm going to turn the lights out. 
In 2008, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish, and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope, in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering. 
Now over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. 
That's what's so special about stories, they're not a widget, they aren't exact. 
When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement, recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country. 
The car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it, and no change whatsoever in the mental workload. 
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on, and were then -- and still are -- being cut back. 
(Laughter) We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons: He's the technology wiz. 
He did not believe they existed in nature. 
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I love the Internet. 
The problem is we're just warming up this growth engine. 
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal. 
(Music) Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning? 
And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings. 
Come here. Come here. Come here. 
[Clapping] And the wild geese are calling down. 
He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. 
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds, he planted it on his 30 acres, all around. 
(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious. 
And even animals, like these donkeys, love our buildings. 
Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right? 
Girl spoiled before ripened. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
They flooded the canals. 
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies, and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets. 
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people, a mix of graduate students, post-docs and even some undergraduates. 
(Applause) It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter) Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper. 
Most of the science that is behind these numbers, these potential targets, is based on studies on land. 
(Music) Text: BeatJazz. 
And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. 
What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street. 
I went to places like Gaza during the war in 2009. 
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. 
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images. 
We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I've called here the "Actor." 
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people -- no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers -- and you work out, if you make the pie rate about 25 percent -- that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy. 
We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal. 
It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there. 
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. 
This is one piece of good news. 
"To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. 
Here are some selection planes. 
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it. 
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. 
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem, but you think of him as a mom. 
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money. 
These are proteins. 
Would you like that? 
So let me go forward to the new science of happiness. 
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in. 
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. 
"An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil in combination with fruits, vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings." 
(Laughter) I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that. 
It's called School Feeding, and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world, and stop it. 
And really, they fundamentally told you, "Are you going to hug a tree, or are you going to hug a child? Pick. 
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers. 
(Laughter) My point is here, people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono. 
What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. 
I'm excited, I'm talking to you, I'm probably producing 150 watts at the moment. You are sitting, you are relaxed, you're looking at me. It's probably 100 watts each person is producing, and we need to get rid of that energy. I need, with my body, to get rid of the energy, and the harder it is for myself, for my body, to get rid of the energy, the less comfort I feel. 
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!" 
And I followed this one pig with number "05049," all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of. 
They're failed states. 
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. 
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense, had the idea, he had the concept, but was unable of fully thinking it yet. 
The picture there is Khrushchev. 
This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. 
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward." 
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. 
On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this. 
Intense fear paralyzes you. 
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq. ft. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out. 
You can use the lighter to start the fire. 
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it. 
This will not happen [again]. 
What values do we most uphold? 
So from this, we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection, but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space. 
It also meant, if the worst came to the worst, I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. 
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking. 
Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves, is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place. 
My story is the power of thought. 
It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. 
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way, in her bead shop in London. 
In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. 
People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor ... 
They report that Israelis who had never been active before, upon seeing the film, understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities. 
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created. 
100 billion. How many can we see? Five. 
Through this architecture by subtraction, these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. 
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less. 
And so you hear me encouraging him, realizing what's happening, and then the magic happens. 
Perhaps they're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know. 
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. 
You can do bigger things. 
So I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire." 
Gravity wins over all other known forces. 
This is an extremely strange fact. 
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this, we'd love to hear about it. 
This was on a monkey hunt, hunting with curare-tipped darts. 
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans. 
And these were all incompatible. 
And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. 
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity. 
A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D. 
Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010, we responded to the tsunami in Chile, the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border. 
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table, the ripples spread out and the fish run away. 
I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. 
At the age of 19, I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K. 
It's a female archetype: she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. 
The same trash site is feeding more than 30 families. 
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities have approached the tasks of planning, design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. 
They work for longer hours with less income, less social welfare. 
Now if you look at these five ways of being, these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. 
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek. 
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand. 
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. 
(Laughter) I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different. 
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction, because it's so important. 
A challenge, of course. 
And the more they succeed and the more power they have, the more unhappy they are. 
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships. 
So now you may be wondering, why does anyone get married ever? 
Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation. 
That's a transformation, two different things. 
Which is a fantastic story, unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production. 
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. 
And if you read that literature, one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know. 
If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life, because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time, keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth, out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve. 
We looked at overall engagement. 
Come on, raise your hands. 
Until midnight, he'd be thinking. 
They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. 
And as he said, I think fittingly, it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work. 
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something, you can find out in two minutes? 
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. 
You do find groups in the animal kingdom -- you do find cooperative groups -- but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. 
I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much? 
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. 
Well at TED2009, Tim Berners-Lee himself, inventor of the Web, gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people's articles about the data, but the raw data. 
Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. 
In this game we had a little girl, and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. 
You need to have children to survive. 
You know what the answer was? 
And to make the project affordable, we focused our energy. 
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways, because it couldn't not work. 
This system takes a long time to develop, slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence. 
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time. 
So, you give people lots and lots of different tasks. 
I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving. 
He had put it together, combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software, which I think his son developed, originally, and produces this wonderful presentation. 
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me. 
So as your model is close to reality, and it converges with feelings, you often don't know it's there. 
And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. 
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meetings.

HC: So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead. 
That's triple bottom line! Okay? 
On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856. 
So now, I suppose, I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. 
Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. 
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. 
Voila! 
What is origami? 
It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. 
The date was February 2000. 
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean. 
And this is the great team that helped us make it happen. 
I just imagined it everywhere," which has happened. 
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. 
We know that's wrong, because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions. 
Since we've launched the program, three million trips have been taken. 
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. 
So let me show you why that's wrong. 
As though that -- we call religious people often believers, as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule. 
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training. 
Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!" 
You are now immortal. 
And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems -- problems that they hadn't anticipated. 
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company. 
And this was just eight months ago. 
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators. 
But perhaps, for me as a chemist, I want to keep away from general terms; I want to think about specifics. 
So I urge you to take that path. 
Will I never get married or have children?" 
This line of evolution is clearly positive. 
And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work. 
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it: "Test Two: Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No. 
You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems. 
If we feel it now and think it through, we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself. 
Thanks. 
And we put them into one of these experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then we watch lively movement that comes out. 
(Applause) (Hammer) (Laughter) (Microwave beeps) (Laughter) You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. 
As rocks and mountains die, grains of sand are born. 
And I'd snuck in -- because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet -- it's the quickest way you can get arrested. 
And with salting, it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. 
And the ones over there, they were so-called Western countries. 
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres. 
So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them. 
Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh. 
Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology. 
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach, someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential? 
I'll explain it in a second. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this. 
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me. 
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet. 
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. 
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe. 
That does not hold for emotions. 
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile. 
Now this sounds a little theoretical, but it's not so theoretical. 
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? 
Thank you. 
But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available. 
It's time for me to let it go. 
It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. 
But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups, which was too detailed. 
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. 
How do we know this? 
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser. 
Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?" 
Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever -- must be able to tell the power outlet, "Hey, power outlet, I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire." 
We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. 
More men who believe that the balance is best? 
The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. 
Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth. 
That's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self-organizing, and this is a very deep insight. 
Now, by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land, you are changing macroclimate. 
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability, and we know the magnitude; it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade. 
Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. 
He was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools. 
So why is this relevant? 
Because what the facts are telling us is that the long, slow journey, humanity's long, slow journey of equality, is actually speeding up. 
(Laughter) The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua, it's about 3,000 miles, and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done. 
I take them backwards here to their independence, when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s. 
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. 
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. 
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. 
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. 
The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration, and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. 
Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. 
And you might think, well, "Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?" 
And I'll quote three people: Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee. 
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency. 
And when you have colonization what do you have? 
You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort -- a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick. 
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything. 
In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. 
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important, but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. 
(Laughter) And I was almost impeached in the process. 
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition. 
If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file, that's 22 meg. 
They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing. 
So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you. 
The curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation, and the black hole radiates. 
But where the DMCA was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer, we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine, and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. 
Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s. 
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. 
And I've been doing projects like this, in 2009 in Lebanon, this year in Kenya, back in January. 
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. 
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now. 
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery? 
I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain. 
And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things early on, as they're moving over into human populations. 
(Applause) That's really amazing. 
India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil -- all of them are multiracial. 
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his [unclear]. 
But over the centuries, we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality, a reality made of fictional entities, like nations, like gods, like money, like corporations. 
And the first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. 
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun, with Paul Hawken. 
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me, and I'm going to take my lumps on this one." 
Now there are many groups doing this. 
And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial. 
So that's what I did. 
(Laughter) And what happened? 
(Applause) Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi. 
They actually export water molecules through. 
But what would have happened if I had said C? 
Well, I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments. 
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation, very dangerous. 
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. 
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass, rolled steel and mass production, we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views, and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces. 
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this. 
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me? 
We were once just as certain that the world was flat. 
But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us. 
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable. 
One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know, by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context, if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. 
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame. 
When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level, we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. 
And then he didn't particularly like school that much, but he got involved in robotics competitions, and he realized he had a talent, and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it. 
So let me show you, and I'm going to start with the standard method first. 
We've got these new antibodies we've identified, and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus. 
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. 
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. 
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago, and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. 
And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea. 
What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology, indicating that they're dominated, not by super-linear innovation and ideas; they become dominated by economies of scale. 
But that cannot account for the mass either. 
That's what she tells them. 
This thing — whoops, can we go back? 
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time. 
March. 
One is power transition, which is change of power amongst states. 
And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. 
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism, Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan. 
This is my tattoo. 
Very, very simple. 
Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red -- this is a relative of DNA, it's an informational molecule -- it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay. 
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care. 
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds, and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals. 
So, again, my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of. 
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded. 
Estonia accused Russia. 
It's not just prevailing at war, though war still persists. 
When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002, what I saw was scenes like this. 
It gets way better. 
All of that is over. 
It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets. 
And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals. 
Today it's less than 50 cents a day. 
What does this mean? 
You can read them yourselves. 
These young boys are in Nepal. 
And what that means is that every time you discuss the future, or any kind of a future event, grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. 
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. 
Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense. 
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. 
Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time, because this story insists that each and every one of us, frail and flawed as we may be, inadequate as we may feel, has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. 
In the cities cluster, one of the most central was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities, and in the genetics cluster, we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter. 
So on the wayside we found these dung cakes, which are used as a fuel. 
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here. 
And you're very careful how you put the straps, particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. 
The rest of the scientific community said, "Great idea, Higgsy. 
We still think it is pristine. 
Or even worse, science education is becoming like that guy who always says, "Actually." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. 
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. 
This is not about how happily a person lives. 
There are many. 
It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do. 
And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really, really powerful. 
This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs, but never by these other signs at the bottom. 
So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons, but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos. 
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these, and people try very hard to separate the plastics, by color, by shape, by feel, by any technique they can. 
And now for the first time, we can say that. 
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with. 
We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. 
And so it goes on. 
Beginning in 2004, every general came in saying, "I've inherited a dismal situation, but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy, which will deliver," in General Barno's word in 2004, the "decisive year." 
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. 
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. 
But he should, because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers. 
How did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite? 
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket. 
With every passing year, I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is. 
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing. 
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. 
So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food, which don't seem right now to have much in common, we can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. 
Women are living longer than ever. 
We collect blood from them, other specimens. 
Initially, all we did was autograph it. 
(Laughter) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. 
I don't mean the software; I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. 
The first of these is natural selection -- that's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. 
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. 
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born, I got my first blind computer, and it's actually here. 
Then when we went to press, the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running. 
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. 
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. 
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan. 
And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person. 
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex. 
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. 
He gives them a platform; he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation; he orchestrates the action. 
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed. 
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, "How bad was the whole thing, in total?" 
And I don't know what you expect, but when I was thinking about that issue, I early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers. 
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this? 
The others were brothers, sisters. 
What does that mean? 
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime, eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter) Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago. 
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think, because all of those cities we're building are opportunities. 
But Peter, Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason. 
It did have a RAM pack. 
So I think, yes, there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations, but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well. 
And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient. 
And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. 
The institutional response is, I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great, that's what I'll do. 
They believe McDonald's food is tastier, and it leads them to experience it as tastier. 
Many technical details to be worked out, but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock, there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination, that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution. 
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling -- thank you, Freud. 
And if you put another wall inside the box, then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box. 
Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. 
Now, since this is TEDActive, and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something, I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you, but rather give you a tool to create your own. 
This is the device we're building now. 
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows. 
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?" 
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. 
Because there is not a human production which exists outside of what I call "the big image." 
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life. 
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. 
That is where you fake. 
I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. 
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is. 
I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are. 
My story is the power of choice. 
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. 
We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece. 
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect. 
Now you know why, and to me, that's the point of this program. 
(Laughter) So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?" 
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important. 
Who designed this? 
Now, what does this mean? 
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. 
And you'll get slower and slower, until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19. 
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. 
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar." 
And so it's been tectonically altered. 
This is Uce. 
And I'm going to admit to hubris. 
And she said, "No, the Lego is the treasure." 
Just do it outside, please." 
Thank you, Danny Kahneman. 
Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that. 
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. 
I'm going to print them and send them back to you. 
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff? 
I can't hear from my right ear. 
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced, but correct usage -- words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations. 
We're in the middle of the process. 
But this is different if we now look at the European individual and an African. 
We know that, right? We've experienced that. 
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone, one American female marketing executive from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone. 
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes. 
That's about a 50th of a millimeter. 
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. 
This is what I found out. 
So we've done pretty well. 
I wish to go with you. 
But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. 
We transformed our apartments into our laboratories, and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way. 
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving, what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. 
And the other thing about these guys is, they also know what they do for a living. 
"Daily Battles." 
Okay. 
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries. 
Everybody has an opinion. 
It's in the forefront of your mind always. 
And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat. 
Like generations before us, we'll be growing up in war -- not a war between civilizations, but a war for civilization, for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age. 
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. 
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it. 
That's aside. 
But we did see a bunch of responses like this. 
They've invented websites that will allow people to be free. 
As soon as the door closed... 
Thank you all very much. 
(Applause) Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin. 
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area. 
I was 95 lbs. 
Now, David Kelley calls this behavior, when it’s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands." 
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. 
They did it with pigs. 
But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off. 
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. 
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about, and that is, what happens? Suppose that what I say is true. 
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place. 
This is a degeneration of the retina. 
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them? 
They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán, and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S. 
And this is the first compelling business benefit. 
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China. 
It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. 
A second skill is equipoise, the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. 
We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. 
Just to give you an example from Iran, we all heard about the Twitter revolution that happened there, but if you look close enough, you'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational. 
You can see the difference. 
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago, and she went to Sweden. 
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math. 
If necessary you can put babies in your ads. 
And they all moved to different parts of the planet. 
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that, as a young person, is confusing me. 
They come there, many times their parents -- you can't see it, but there's a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there -- the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored. 
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is, they switched all the rules round, so that the way to successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country, has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new — you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter) Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one. 
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus. 
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system. 
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through, and in other areas, it's a ventilating system, so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. 
So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving, in three dimensions. 
Of course, they're not alive. 
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars. 
The murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopened for trains. 
Now, think about how this can change people's lives. 
To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946. 
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. 
If you really want great hamburger, it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain. 
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower, and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads. 
What's going on?" 
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. 
(Laughter) It's for cooked food. 
And my answer must at once be, it is no use. 
After all, aging is not a piece of cake. 
You prove one, you prove the other. 
One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable. 
It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar. 
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from. 
An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck. 
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. 
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. 
So I wear two hats in most of what I do. 
And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. 
(Laughter) But it shrunk to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass. 
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and -- I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. 
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" -- is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. 
Now I'm not a neuroscientist. 
If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. 
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank, and actually a very, very good one. 
The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. 
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, "In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion." 
And for far too long, we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. 
Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft, but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact, the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today: the telephone. 
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday. 
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work, and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows, it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of. 
(Applause) ♫ I think I'm ready to do my thing ♫ ♫ I think I'm ready to take my chances ♫ ♫ I've been dining out and all stressed out ♫ ♫ Due to the circumstances. See? ♫ ♫ I gotta get up, get up, get up, get up ♫ ♫ Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up ♫ ♫ I see what you're saying ♫ ♫ We sent a demo to the world, they said it sounds like Take 6 ♫ ♫ I said "Hold on, wait a minute, I'll be back with the remix" ♫ ♫ They looking at us funny, we can't make any money ♫ 
That is the essence of being human. 
For example, I was too shy then, and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material. 
And a focus group cannot do it. 
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees. 
She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. 
(Laughter) The idea is that we can just type this in, this kind of question in, however we think of it. 
He turned it into an adventure for the kids. 
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. 
And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables. 
And after hours of negotiation, 500 dogs were rescued. 
We can do it with proven technology. 
Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts. 
So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system. 
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite: many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics. 
So, we did another experiment. 
(Applause) Let's talk about billions. 
So they're skin cells that can be tricked, kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state. 
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know, I was a biology major before I went into architecture, the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing. 
This was probably the toughest place to explore. 
The son's dead. The father lives. 
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there, you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. 
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen. 
Thank you very much. 
Step inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else. 
It's bushfelt region, which is dry and prone to a lot of fires, as so what these trees have done is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree, and that this is ground level, imagine that the whole thing, that whole bulk of the tree, migrated underground, and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. 
You both won. I congratulate both of you. 
If, of course, that were true, there would be no innovation, and nobody could make any money. 
Well I believe that in any context anywhere, he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. 
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil, just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there. 
Pave them with the five ways. 
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins, and bred nearly as successfully. 
And he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room. 
And that was actually an excellent business, because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. 
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose. 
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. 
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. 
And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?" 
But the good news is they are out there. 
And if you can, just scribble a pattern. 
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation. 
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. 
And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. 
And they were just made in a community of bikers, mainly in Northern California. 
And I left New York freaked, but actually empowered. 
We actually have to do something about it. 
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine. 
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately. 
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. 
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea, right? 
So the store actually did really well. 
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks. 
And most of all, I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. 
And thanks to Deworm the World, and the effort of many country governments and foundations, 20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009. 
Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically. 
Why? 
So, I was able to stone one adulterer. 
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents. 
And I sat in on several meetings. 
I had no idea what was going on, but strangers intervened, kept my heart moving, beating. 
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals. 
I was launched as a cartoonist. 
It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. 
And it's with that thought that I'll end. 
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, "Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories." 
There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king. 
What do I need? I need a lot of circles. 
And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. 
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face. 
And this is air temperature. 
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin. 
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer, then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote -- the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive." 
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail. 
And that's what we've found in practice, and that's what the history of journalism is. 
When I was five years old, I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty. 
But out in the landscape, one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles of bulldozed desert. 
And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. 
(Laughter) Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. 
Well in a real war, you can't do that; you'll get shot down. 
I just got this impression that the money would work. 
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor. 
And you cannot do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story. 
Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line? 
I present to you an excerpt of that work "Simhanandini." 
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars. 
He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art. 
But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. 
The perception in the 17th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere. 
So that brings us down to 0.8. 
And let's think about urban living, not today, and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years? 
Because of our metabolism, we as human beings, we produce heat. 
Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically, the barriers to entry go down. 
So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities. 
DR: Right, which the towers fell into. 
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong. 
Now, if you like to represent this zero and one of binary, you need a device. 
For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys. 
There was no ice around. 
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. 
The innovation was to build a clay vault. 
Two suns together, prosperous. 
And the point is, we need to carry on increasing well-being. 
He's leaving red ink behind. 
You can buy half a billion today, and they are actually better, because they are faster. 
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. 
(Laughter) But I thought I needed to lose weight, and when I gained it back, of course I blamed myself. 
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. 
Do something different. What do you want to be? 
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet. 
(Laughter) It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it. 
It would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, without so much as a coffee break. 
Now when you add all those things together, when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools, you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get? 
My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation, and this man was elected president of this country. 
And it's walked away. I mean, it's that mechanical. 
And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. 
You can't see the future, obviously. 
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos. 
Working together is what changes our world. 
They are almost a form of reassurance. 
And here's another example. 
And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline. 
The saboteur is there, and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War." 
On May 11th last year, I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. 
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet, because in Enron, there's also a social element. 
No one's responding to each other. 
(Applause) When we think of games, there's all kinds of things. 
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. 
Think of a hamster in the pocket. 
Imagine 30 percent unemployment in America as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty. 
So these guys, you see them. 
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals, such as here in Walter Reed. 
That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted. 
There are a lot of people also -- very big support, like those 3,000 people who signed the petition to release me. 
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher. 
And, on the left, Riley. 
And these five ways, which we put onto these handy postcards, I would say, don't have to cost the earth. 
So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. 
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video. 
Not many people check boxes. 
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching. 
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school. 
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. 
I'm intrigued by this concept. 
I know I don't need it. 
in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site. 
This gift came to me about five months ago. 
So we need to stop the ignorance, stop the intolerance, stop the stigma, and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos, take a look at the truth, and start talking, because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together, by standing strong together. 
I'm not the first person to say this. 
What makes them moral? 
It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute, and information is provided just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination. 
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us. 
The first thing I thought about was my mom, who was crying over beside me. 
You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade, and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do. 
'The world' is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific. 
And your filter bubble is your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online. 
More of our economics is global in scale. 
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway. 
This is Mashpee Commons, the oldest retrofit that we've found. 
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery, who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies. 
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. 
And we've looked at 23,000 companies in the United States, may I say. 
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person: your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion, sitting next to them, listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time. 
So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many, many, many cities over 20 million people. 
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet, but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America, Europe, Japan and other developed parts of the world. 
You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. 
(Laughter) So, we turned to the data again. 
So the very first week we were working, we got the price down to 500 dollars. 
But in the quarter-century since then, we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk. 
So with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one. 
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. 
Well, that's the end of my talk. 
Now multiply it by 100. 
I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships. 
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. 
And if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks, you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000. 
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing, is fingered speech. That's what texting is. 
I don't think it's that bad of a deal. 
This is the cover story. 
It's not about making learning happen. 
One woman loses six. 
Is Microsoft a great big anthill? 
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. 
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. 
(Laughter) Though I'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well. 
So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. 
(Laughter) And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines. 
For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. 
One is another American inventor Ted Henter. 
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. 
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid. 
Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu. 
How can I apply this in my life? 
Change happens slowly. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But the sixth-graders demand it. 
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power. 
But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people, like here in Chandigarh, India, the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. 
I think what we need is action." 
She was in her grandmother's backyard, and she saw something that made her break down in tears. 
Let's go to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this, that's fine, just tell us, we will take you home. We love you no matter what.'" And she says, "So I went the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration, and I looked around and I just knew I couldn't do it. 
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make, and it was political dynamite, frankly. 
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. 
What we do is humanize the tissue. 
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. 
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out. 
But cities give you this opportunity to create new places, with new rules that people can opt in to. 
What this mother -- and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world -- understands [is] that, to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies. 
That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating. 
And so, in fact, he actually set about doing a variety of things. 
How to distribute it between pedestrians, bicycles, public transport and cars? 
We should do better than this. 
And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life? 
There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on. 
SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example. 
How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to? 
What on earth is wrong with placebos? 
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. 
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial. 
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person. 
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums. 
So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, vegetables. 
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. 
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia. 
People are willing to invest more, and the budgets are larger. 
And I realized it had to come from the people. 
But they have those social skills. 
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. 
(Applause) Now people tend to use an alternative approach, which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. 
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. 
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: "intentional evolution," "evolution by design" -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. 
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way, or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space. 
But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, "But what about corruption? 
And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like, for example, this film. 
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing? 
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. 
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know, "Would Signore like the truffles?" 
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things, we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon, and it makes it go from sweet to savory. 
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet. 
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.

No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic. 
And I'm going to give that to you now. 
You say, what's the probability of being caught? 
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA. 
We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations. 
(Applause) So, I'm an artist. 
Now we do the same with drills and machines. 
They have literally beat a path to our door. 
And Brian's shoulders sank. 
(Laughter) I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance, and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing. 
We want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. 
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution. 
I'm an individual. I'm one person. 
Mine was that of Durga, Durga the fearless one. 
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way, pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in, you can pull back out. 
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself, charming though it is, but rather to these photos. 
So that started the journey. 
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great. 
Or, you take this particular un-retouched photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, "Is there any perceptual difference between males and females?" 
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. 
It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. 
Now on to the detection algorithms. 
(Applause) I collaborate with bacteria. 
I'm talking about, how do we secure the space, the demos, the platform of values, so that we can tap into all of your potential? 
So instead, it slides in grooves on the outside of the head. 
That we know how to eradicate poverty, we just need to do more? 
And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about and volunteered as much time as we could, we would change this world, we would save this world.

I told my mother I couldn't do it. 
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. 
And after the war was over, there was an audit done -- as the army always does, the air force always does -- and they asked the question: how many Scuds did we actually destroy? 
Because, you know, we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom, but we both like to live larger than life. 
In a major article published in 1978, Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York described a model to understand how conflicts could arise. 
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. 
I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough -- things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. 
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain." 
But they typically use it to light up the screen. 
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. 
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later; none of us really believes this. 
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. 
But fortunately, the consensus was, "Look, this is a problem in a lot of places. 
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing? 
What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go? 
Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. 
And there it is on the shelves. 
But there was a fourth message, and this message simply said, "When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans. 
Each day, people make new decisions, and people change and the world changes around them, and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don't even notice. 
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them out there, but they're here, right? 
We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. 
They say "No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership." 
And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem. 
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women. 
That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing. 
And further back, 800,000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans. 
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV." 
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. 
And the idea was to put McSweeney's -- McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year, and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time. 
The battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor, Alessandro Volta, at the University of Padua in Italy. 
It's full of us, it's full of our stuff, full of our waste, full of our demands. 
(Applause) I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. 
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. 
This photo: this woman, man, I feel her. 
Then we'll test some other ideas out. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. 
(Laughter) Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. 
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it. 
"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40, exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?" 
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. 
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof, and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun. 
And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and to inherit the wisdom, that we'll need to make these choices wisely? 
I need you to turn that piece of paper over; you should find that it’s blank on the other side. 
This is because, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, it is possible to have transitions between two states, even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states, and the phenomenon is called, quite appropriately, quantum tunneling. 
Well it's extraordinary. 
And so there was a moment when suddenly -- actually, the next thing. 
And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating. 
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches. 
Anybody can play in the game. 
(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing? 
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion. 
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging? 
None of these are using the organisms. 
Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist. 
So you have an image, a retina, and a brain. 
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times. 
And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology, and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this, this is the new green graffiti. 
And why is that? It's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think. 
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. 
You. Yeah. (Laughter) With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter) You know who you are. 
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds. 
Just beautiful. 
Ooooh. 
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society. 
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. 
What are you feeling and thinking about this photo, about this woman? 
This to me, in its own strange way, is very, very comforting. 
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is. 
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. 
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. 
All of this happens in seconds. 
There's got to be a middle way. 
You just don't have it. 
I've also been to places in this U.S., and I know that girls in this country also have wishes, a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx, a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A., a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas, a wish for a better life somewhere in New York, a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey. 
That's a magnifier times 10. 
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data. 
And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development. 
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. 
But this trend is less unambiguous. 
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year. 
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism. 
♫ imposing its will ♫ ♫ and ruling by force ♫ ♫ on and on through time. ♫ ♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫ ♫ it would have to be now. ♫ ♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫ 
(Laughter) That's how you know you've baited the hook, right? 
But she helped organize people, and helped turn it into a movement. 
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around. 
Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation, because we know for example, India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. 
And this was a cause for celebration. 
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers, and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement. 
We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters -- the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius -- vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. 
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground, this may be counter-intuitive, but driving has potholes, cobblestones, pedestrians, other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with. 
That's so true. 
They've come together. 
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. 
So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. 
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. 
But I can taste things. 
(Applause) I was raised in Seoul, Korea, and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college. 
Now that is pretty authoritarian, and that's something I'm very much critical of. 
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent. 
I think we have three challenges for the future. 
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times. 
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs. 
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade, and which can generate a lot of jobs, and which is, in any case, a sensible sector to expand, post-conflict, and that is the construction sector. 
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund. 
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there. 
He has been very supportive of me. 
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?" 
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit, of which Windows has not some, [but] several? 
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building, and to do this, we sampled dust. 
So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money. 
Thank you. 
A couple of years ago, I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal, a mid-sized container ship carrying nearly 7,000 boxes, and I departed from Felixstowe, on the south coast of England, and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later, considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now. 
That's the stigma. 
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. 
(Laughter) Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. 
No, no, no, no. Better -- to live of cooked food. 
I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year, and I was drifting backwards most of the time. 
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened. 
I will not hate for you or even hate you. 
And others fly today like echoes of the past. 
He got his name from fighting stark naked. 
But that's not the case with real networks. 
And when she couldn't produce enough, she hired other women in the village. 
In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it. 
But there's another thing. 
This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than three years. 
They're the next turn of this particular screw, which has been going on 20 years now. 
A somatic cell, a body cell, was taken from its body, gestated in the ovum of a cow, and then that cow gave birth to a guar. 
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that? 
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. 
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him. 
And so even at a young age, that really resonated with me, and the whole notion of environmental preservation, at a very basic level, sunk in with me. 
Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union, and the data referred to 1989. 
So I broke the silence. 
So how would you use this device? 
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort, we can shift it one way or the other. 
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills. 
But what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease. 
So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands. 
He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. 
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it. 
So I hope you can see. 
And what's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton, it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide. 
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it? 
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past. 
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean. 
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003. 
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. 
It's a green saber of light. 
There is a conflict in developing world cities for money, for government investment. 
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make. 
This didn't work. 
And over and over again, as I interviewed them and spent my days with them, I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. 
The scores went up to 50, which is what the posh schools of New Delhi, with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. 
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now. 
You want to look and see what good foie gras is, it's got to be bright yellow. 
Then I started going into the tunnels, which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don't get to see. 
All of that talks about working memory, what we can do and what we can't do. 
So they're looking at me really odd. 
Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us. 
I said, "No." 
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures. 
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him. 
I was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!" 
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player. 
And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?" 
(Applause) I’m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician. 
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena. 
We can start making better, wiser, more sustainable decisions. 
They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. 
(Applause) Yay! (Applause) Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause) (Music) [Sanskrit] This is an ode to the mother goddess, that most of us in India learn when we are children. 
TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome. 
You get 223,000 hits -- no results you can use. 
But that's all about energy and industry. 
We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. 
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down? 
Instead, there was a litany of astonishing optimism. 
These are some questions that we've yet to ask. 
We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books, and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. 
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. 
They're far more efficient in terms of energy. 
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write. 
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. 
Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday: what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am -- is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots. 
It is questions. 
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall. 
And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows. 
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs. 
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist, but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. 
(Applause) Number four: giant solar flares. 
It is still boiling. 
However, it was possible, finally, after very difficult battles, to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity, that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. 
And really slowly, slowly, slowly, it happened. 
So we rented this space. 
And that's unlike many of our competitors. 
(Laughter) You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. 
It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana. 
It's a secret. 
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected. 
So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. 
And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. 
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, "takes me out of my everyday realm" and "makes me feel better." 
They have to be nutritious, and they have to be locally produced. 
RNA provides the information for protein. 
Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. 
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations. 
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web. 
The pollen has little barbs on it, if we look. 
Engines, gearshift -- four choices. 
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now. 
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them. 
And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future. 
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt." 
Let's start for real." That was our official launch. 
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. 
Make them a healthy plate, especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso! 
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, "You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows. 
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died. 
Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights, we do say that human rights are universal. 
This is a very well-known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways -- quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. 
That's 25 years ago. 
And I really dedicated myself to that, both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. 
And Beijerinck's discovery, this was not something that occurred 500 years ago. 
And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate, to emerge, to survive. 
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. 
(Laughter) And running gives me a lot of energy. 
And then you put tree seeds in here, and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box. 
(Music) These are all troubles outside of myself. 
So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very, very large budget. 
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it. 
And whale oil lit practically every building. 
It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. 
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great." 
It's a positive, virtuous circle. 
About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action, and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings. 
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists, which is, "Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes?" 
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. 
He's out of time. 
(Applause) We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years. 
Or wait to capture the second half of it. 
And Feynman also understood this. 
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen. 
You have made someone's life better by something that you said or that you did, and if you think you haven't, think about all the hands that didn't go back up when I asked that question. 
This is what it looks like in reality; you have this irregular ring around it, with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families. 
It can be expensive, not feasible, unethical, or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing. 
Now I did have an advantage. 
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. 
I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it. 
It's simple. Share your passion. 
We think children deserve better. 
For the children of today, for tomorrow's child: as never again, now is the time. 
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV. 
So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. 
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 -- and I don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales. 
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design. 
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke? 
And Sequel truly is a real car. 
In the end, it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. 
These words, I hold onto all my life. 
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer. 
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions, we do that all the time, so you can visualize it. 
The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. 
A no-brainer. 
So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism, it would be that it's one of criminality, one of war. 
Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo. 
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. 
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well. 
So shortly after the war, this young man, Yutaka Taniyama, developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. 
You can sort of have it all with these things. 
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people. 
We can do multiple passes through that same entry. 
Several years ago, there was one African girl. 
And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality, to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists. 
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. 
Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy. 
We know our universes are united though -- links between left and right. 
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better, and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ... 
Boy comes home from school, and he says, "I hate writing." 
Which of these hypotheses can be true? 
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. 
They can give them more control over pricing, which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album "In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price, but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time. 
It's to say we operate on two levels. 
And Baron-Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills, and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped. 
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics, but underlying this is the social networks, because this is a universal phenomenon. 
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that? 
This is about as good as maps get, and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust, the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. 
And from that point on, from my age at the time, I began to think of things in a different way. 
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things: First, the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives. 
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health. 
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. 
Now that was a nice idea, so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase. 
Thank you very much. 
This is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s. 
And that's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent, which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states. 
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us, the international community, to reach every single child, every single community, the most vulnerable people in the world, with the most basic of health services, irrespective of geography, poverty, culture and even conflict. 
This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole, doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank. 
Now, this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. 
They literally flipped the switch. 
They would dress the robots. 
I think that's cheap, at the price. 
And from these extracts, we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations, risk factors and inherited diseases. 
So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. 
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. 
And he says, "And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary?" 
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. 
A pair of helices and 40 wooden slats. 
(Laughter) So, some years later I was doing a building, a little house on the beach for Norton Simon, and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady, called me and said, "Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head." 
It's two houses. 
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife. 
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you. 
(Laughter) And it has made me a healthier person. 
This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. 
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. 
But to make it more real, if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power, you could buy a car today for five dollars. 
It's not just a root supplying a plant, but for each of those plants, whatever it is -- a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together, and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. 
What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TEDTalk? 
And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective. 
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about. 
I love hanging out with three year-olds. 
It's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand, and then communication is limited. 
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize. 
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something that most women don't do. 
And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. 
And it's not just kids, it's adults too. 
And luckily, he met this guy, who is Rodrigo Baggio, the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil. 
Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves. 
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week, do you really need your own car? 
Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized. 
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. 
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here. 
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is: virtually nothing -- and I mean this honestly -- has been invented yet. 
No, you can't. 
And the questions usually have a very particular format. 
And I sat down, and I opened my legs. 
And after nine months of grueling recovery, he's now eating steak with A1 sauce. 
So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber. 
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet. 
The Starrs are a regular American family with their share of regular American family problems. 
But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems, in fact, are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion, towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
SW: Again. 
This was the estimate of the new survey. 
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly. 
Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. 
(Laughter) But sometimes -- (Laughter) But sometimes I also do get -- I wouldn't call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern: "Dr. Hong, are you insane, trying to put blind people on the road? 
That's how we improve. 
And in the United States Senate, we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the Senate, and this room can help. 
She is now running for president. 
This is how you hold the needle. 
The other fact is that the ground state, the lowest energy state of a quantum system, the wave function is always very smooth -- has the minimum number of wiggles. 
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. 
We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day, June 17, when women go out and drive. 
Don't try that one. 
Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants, because they move the pollen from one flower to the other, yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. 
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion. 
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. 
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. 
He says something's just. She says something else is just. 
But we need to go even further. 
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important. 
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue. 
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido. 
(Applause) We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us. 
I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me, and they looked at me as an inspiration. 
And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right? 
Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. 
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. 
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. 
It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. 
And we have 24 seconds each. 
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran. 
(Music) Look at the eyes. 
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. 
(Laughter) I heard a wide variety of tones. 
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat, or fears, such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. 
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes." 
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right? 
Have a good day. Thank you. 
And somehow these amino acids are combined, and life begins. 
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today, not consciously, of course, but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire. 
Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger. 
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense and a CFO, or Comptroller. 
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made, and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did. 
(Applause) Innovation, compassion and passion. 
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people. 
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. 
It involves communicators to keep the funding high, to keep the visibility high, to tell the success stories. 
What's important is that they be about the same. 
Let me tell you a secret. 
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky. 
And we look, and we find, as you would expect, a contrast in the landscape where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way. 
I'm talking about mindful eating: learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry. 
That's very practical and extremely awesome. 
When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time, one of the things they're gonna ask you, is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives, some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet, to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world. 
The brochures still say it is untouched. 
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens. 
So I wanted to become a teacher. 
That's a tragedy for those populations, but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat. 
Over the last 30 years, in terms of the GDP growth rates, China has grown at twice the rate of India. 
But also, I've been blessed with amazing mentors who've opened doors for me that I didn't even know were there. 
So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife. 
And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby. 
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help. 
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. 
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. 
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. 
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards. 
I actually am. 
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise. 
You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the Library of Congress. 
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. 
So when I started my business, I knew two things: All of my items had to be eco-friendly, and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. 
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes. 
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me. 
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization. 
This is not mine, by the way. 
Cost-benefit analysis. 
And even though I finished my degree, I realized I could not settle into a career in law. 
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. 
As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. 
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. 
And so we started to analyze why. 
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy. 
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world? 
On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. 
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. 
Secondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet, and start moving them around. 
Let's think about it and what it means, but please, let's not do more of that. 
If we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this, we will not resolve or counter terrorism. 
For instance, this one. 
It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. 
(Applause) Good evening. 
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization. 
And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems. 
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years. 
That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. 
And so this is not a video. 
Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn. 
The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live, but up here we can. 
We the children had gathered at a friend's house. 
More than how a phenomenon works, theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. 
We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the 100 largest cities in the United States, and located the stations so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time. 
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. 
And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover. 
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that. 
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. 
BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. 
This is natural from the environment, this clay. 
At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. 
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure. 
But that alone doesn't give us the road map. 
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions. 
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted. 
This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. 
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible. 
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment, because another conference is taking place in Berlin. 
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. 
And apparently it's being remade right now and it's going to be coming out next year. 
Stop looking where you're going, turn, check your blind spot, and drive down the road without looking where you're going. 
Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long? 
But I did know the game was up. 
A chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!" 
We think of our future as anticipated memories. 
So let's show how we do that. 
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack. 
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. 
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. 
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. 
That's bad news for us too. 
(Laughter) Yeah, that's a terrifying result. 
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life -- the word "life." 
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. 
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. 
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born. 
Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. 
In particular, nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain, that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school, that leave a big scar. 
People still are dying in Burkina Faso, and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. 
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, organisms starter making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it. 
And now, here's my wish: I wish that you would help with the creation, launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion, crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule. 
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. 
In the eye of a theoretical physicist, the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass, but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. 
There is what Oprah tells us. 
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track -- that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket, you're going to watch a new T.V. channel. 
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. 
With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. 
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna. 
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly. 
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. 
(Laughter) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over. 
Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale, into a sand dune. 
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. 
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. 
And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries. 
Well, of course, I wanted to build models. 
So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period, and no one is taking care of plants. 
And the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs. 
He said, "He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself, without lessening mine. 
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling. 
She said, "On the day before I started university, I was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad, and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this, that I wasn't ready for university, that I just burst into tears. 
They're not these little harbor seals. 
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. 
And the map is actually a little bit bigger. 
I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. 
This is Eric. He plays for the football team. 
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. 
It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship. 
She is 15 years old. 
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. 
This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K. 
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ... 
This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. 
So maybe you should put some one before the interview." 
You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. 
I'm sorry for this. 
The answer is our imagination. 
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. 
This is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela, again, with high quality. 
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar." 
You will hear about it, and you will love it. 
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. 
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares. 
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. 
And so the problem with chemists -- and this is a massive advantage as well -- is we like to focus on our elements. 
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink. 
But, you know, the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. 
Why is it it came up? 
We get a lot of our food from all around the world, and people from all around the world are importing our food system, so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. 
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [use] to communicate with each other. 
That's pretty cool. 
You need to pull him. 
Here's a real simple example. 
They're things like this. 
And I realized that this wasn't just my life. 
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century, but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century. 
I had fun. 
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. 
It's actually faster to read than to view. 
There's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life. 
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day. 
So that if we want to create environments with good rules, we can't just tear down. 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. 
The frontispiece of this article was this photo, and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker, because this photo completely rocked my world. 
(Laughter) Why do, statistically, a majority of people say that a word is sad, in this case, heavy in other cases? 
Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?" 
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world. 
Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. 
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side, with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. 
So we're on a road towards living systems. 
So these are sales teams in Belgium. 
It's something we have to, too, and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start, in effect, putting on their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever. 
When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. 
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right? 
If you made that decision in 1965, the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution. 
They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate, who have never ever done homework. 
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet. 
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. 
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest, because it clears it away. 
And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. 
The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. 
There is also a big question of ambiguity. 
And in telling stories, each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. 
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. 
At the lower end of the scale, you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's, and you also find a computer program, in this case in the language Fortran, which obeys really strict rules. 
So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems, a million star systems, looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. 
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone." 
Now speaking of evolution, from basic biology, you probably remember that the animal kingdom, including humans, have four basic primal instincts. 
This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition, including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com, which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter) On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article -- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here -- but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written, including the controversies over body image and commercialization, 
(Laughter) And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. 
Maybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies, that cost lots of money and took lots of time. 
If we could turn them off, then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. 
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations. 
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness, do you feel dreadful. 
This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. 
Science, theater, research, philosophy, games of the mind and the body, they were daily exercises. 
And we came up with Econol. 
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project, which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. 
What's number one? 
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. 
It's just happening in another part of the world. 
Let me wrap it up. 
That's all ships, airplanes, trains and automobiles combined. 
But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him, each one claiming "'I was here first' ... 
If you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do. 
It fits into the environment. It is the environment. 
In northern India, we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this, so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters, so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. 
At that moment I was less and less human, I was also, at the same time, maybe the most human I've ever been. 
This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. 
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is, "Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is, and I don't know if it's important." 
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll, the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. 
In between, we want to talk to people about it. 
What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution? 
SS (video): We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. 
So, husbands start beating wives, mothers and fathers beat their children, and afterward, they feel awful. 
In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees. 
They have infused societies with kindness, and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half. 
But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. 
So we really can make changes. 
And it was a really heavy time. 
And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City, built out six bus rapid transit lines, 57 miles of new speedy bus lanes. 
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce, go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities, both domestically and internationally, ever recorded. 
So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas in your mind, and that people tell you that it's impossible to make, well, that's an even better reason to want to do it, because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result, whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way. 
So you have to be careful with hacker. 
(Applause) MJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour power demand and supply, looking at solar, wind, using data for California. 
So I say to Tony, "Sorry, but it's worse than you think. 
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. 
For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well. 
For 18 days, our cameras were broadcasting, live, the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. 
And finally also, I never understood this, some people really came up with their own version of the truth. 
And they said, "Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve, because want his product to be associated with pigs." 
Didn't have a product, but had energy. 
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right. 
We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared. 
It just drives me crazy. 
Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. 
You need to somehow find the fitness function. 
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. 
The high is the average of 103 scientific, peer-reviewed studies. 
That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now. 
So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment. 
Now I'm not in the least bit religious, neither was my father, but at that point, I noticed something happening here. 
Here is Viking I, Viking II. 
And today, after the global economic crisis, there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene. 
Everything in its place. First stage. 
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too. 
It took as long as the Taj Mahal. 
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize. 
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults. 
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute, arguably world-class worrier. 
"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives," I wrote these men. 
It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. 
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane." 
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. 
But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it. 
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough. 
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. 
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake. 
And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung, but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses, breast tumors, that had metastasized widely all over the body. 
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it. 
When we track them down and ask them what's going on, they say something like, "I'm just not the creative type." 
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale. 
In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist, who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest, is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality. 
And now we can see what happens. 
Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes? 
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things, which I was excited to do, but I didn't know how it was going to work. 
The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. 
How do we know that? 
So there's no stigma. 
(Applause) I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. 
So, how do you construct belief? 
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera, but they prevent twice as many accidents. 
And as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery, we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself. 
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away." 
Food is gold there. 
I didn't know what those things meant, neither did Dick -- neither did Sydney for that matter. 
Hello, come in, Earth. 
So before we can really start to make life, we have to really think about where it came from. 
And with just a little bit of planning, we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people, reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. 
And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. 
CA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience. 
That's my wish. 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. 
Shukran! (Applause) I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you because I have no form of PowerPoint presentation. 
I've described to you the opposite of a success story. 
They are now buying cars. 
We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. 
Thirdly, when Norden was making his calculations, he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. 
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. 
It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line. 
(Laughter) is they decided that, well I need to learn to speak. 
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. 
Fast-forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store. 
(Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins. 
And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. 
I actually wrote, "OMG," hopefully for the last time in public ever. 
What does that tell us? 
And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. 
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time, and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation, where it's 100 percent bare. 
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency. 
And at 110 lbs., that's very important for solving the other side of the equation -- driving. 
We've got to show we're a better product. 
On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me. 
And I think that can be some really good news. 
We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once, like Sierra Leone a few years ago, and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact, as we know, live on the edge, live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. 
He should not have been surprised. 
French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note, imitating the melodic contours of those languages. 
Maybe just a little. 
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages. 
So I created the place Samboja Lestari, and the idea was, if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..." 
We needed proof. 
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases. 
(Applause) Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second, and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. 
The wall was covered with ... 
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East. 
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right. 
(Applause) I'd like to take you to another world. 
So, I would like to say to you, each one in the audience, if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care, and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals, specifically five and six, should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up. 
(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies, 75 percent of your risk is that first flight. 
It stands with the American constitution. 
We have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters. 
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift, from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture, a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. 
Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. 
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it. 
Now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to, with social learning and language, we could transform the environment to suit our needs. 
Actually, that's a documentary that's available online; the video's online. 
So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily something new. It has been happening since over a thousand years ago, but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities. 
My father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday, for example. 
This is a half-scale model. 
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them. 
You think of carbon as black. 
This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort. 
And he's driving it all with this platform here, with a five-finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse, which he specially designed in order to do this system. 
Here's what he wrote in starting that out. 
You're tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways, in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds. 
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell. 
Mummies are a great source of information, except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well. 
A lot of young girls look up to me. 
Let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football, World Cups, Olympic Games around the world, looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities, and let me start with Mexico. 
But does it really work? 
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us. 
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911. 
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment? 
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. 
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free. 
In the meantime, I was chairing donor meetings, for instance, in which the various donors, and many of them like to be in Nairobi -- it is true, it is one of the unsafest cities of the world, but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable. 
I thought there were them and there were us, and I was not one of them. 
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone? 
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity. 
Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues, if we can feel these things more deeply, then they'll matter to us more than they do now. 
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. 
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about, but your husband might leave you, your girlfriend could cheat, your headaches might be more serious than you thought, or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. 
The background to one is the other. 
And she said, "It's for you. 
I was like, "Yeah. 
My parents got me a tutor in French, and I still suck in French. 
And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident. 
Child: And then his went on the ground. 
Go and study it." (Laughter) And "go and study it" was what he meant. 
And so, of course, with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture. 
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics, because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them. 
Okay, here it is. 
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations. 
This is big trouble for these guys. 
Remoteness affects the quality of education. 
We put one every 25 miles on the freeway, and it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations. 
I mean, they want to know what you're up to. 
It's called Cannonau. 
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. 
Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. 
These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me, and I kind of figured it out. 
and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?" 
And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate. 
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this. 
It was in the microwave range, and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously. 
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. 
And somebody has to see you and listen to you. 
(Laughter) Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. 
I say, if you want to make something dirt cheap, make it out of dirt -- (Laughter) preferably dirt that's locally sourced. 
(Laughter) And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email. 
So we opened the world’s first flight school. 
Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. 
Now fast forward to 1900: half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia, but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. 
My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. 
Conscious listening always creates understanding. 
This is the main method that I use. This is called functional MRI. 
One of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized. 
She gets about that close and then she pulls away. 
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need. 
So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history: change over time. 
So that's the new me. 
Not because you force them to do something against their will, but because they wanted to connect. 
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four. 
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. 
Which is rooted in one-life culture. 
"We will still see each other," I insisted. 
"Hey, wait a minute. 
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. 
Grzegorz from Warsaw said, "Ah, for me it is fear. 
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board, there is a lot of force, a lot of power. 
What if I walked past you and later on you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer, and that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team, because it's true. 
So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, we wanted to build a healthcare network, because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. 
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line. 
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two. 
But he was right. 
This kind of thing happens a lot. 
There are some drug treatments, but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population. And so, for the vast majority of patients, their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices. 
We humans, we also live in an objective reality. 
Over two million people became refugees. 
I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in 2008. 
I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey, and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains. 
Why? Because bankers are smart people. 
And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. 
They all come out with very much the same list. 
CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you. (Applause) My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. 
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it." 
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus. 
One idea, incidentally -- and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on -- is that our Big Bang was not the only one. 
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. 
We have to fix our immigration policy. 
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. 
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know, crack better jokes, say better things, but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. 
And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling, literally crumbling. 
You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. 
It's so wonderful to sing together again!" 
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies." 
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. 
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel. 
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment. 
It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation, thought about computers, how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them. 
And so, I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly, it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular. 
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is? 
That is the nation-state mentality. 
Now don't get me wrong. 
Right now today, in Oslo as it happens, oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries. 
And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess. 
(Applause) I am going to speak about corruption, but I would like to juxtapose two different things. 
Those of you who have been to India have seen that. 
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. 
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard; it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. 
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher, and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. 
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold. 
It's not a matter of calculation. 
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students. 
Well, when I started working there, about one percent of children were fully immunized. 
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms, the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self-rule, privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts. 
And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called "the optical delusion of everyday consciousness." 
The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter) But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. 
So I actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non-lethal weapons when they're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them. 
I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. 
Now here's something -- a 3D printer. 
Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench. 
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. 
The baby wagged her tongue back. 
Forget it, they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. 
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. 
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first, and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. 
We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt, and our college completion rate is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada. 
(Applause) Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. 
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again." 
I was probably being a little extreme. 
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it. 
So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality. 
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. 
I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than 4:15. 
Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons. 
Yes, sure. 
The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. 
No, I don't think it is. 
Anything else would run contrary to our values, it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground, it would run contrary to our interests. 
HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I staring at each other, we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty, and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat. 
The World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that. 
And luckily, the water was quite shallow, and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. 
Now that would give you an unfair advantage." 
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. 
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses. 
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. 
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees. 
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus. 
When Jerry Brown was elected, this was the challenge that was put to him. 
And people started laying bread in tribute, and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. 
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place. 
It's very cold outside. 
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage. 
With this big screen, you can all rap with me. Okay? 
French parents were more likely to say things like, "Noah was here for so little time, but he taught us so much. 
These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. 
And these are horrible images. 
And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? 
The media and the Internet love to rank cities. 
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? -- and so on; it's just a movement. 
So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time, he walked in and he said, "You don't want me to sing, do you?" 
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation. 
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like, weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves. 
We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. 
So, I wanted to show you something. 
And Plato, he had a lot of the same concerns that we did. 
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico. 
But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness. 
Audience: (Claps) (Laughter) Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play. 
So what are the risks? 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter) This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl, her back ruined by napalm, and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War. 
Thank you. 
What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language? 
(Laughter) You see, cowboys and French farce people don't go well together, and the system knows that. 
At that point, what's going to happen? 
We are looking forward to having this technology on the road, and we think the right path is to go through the self-driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large. 
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable. 
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of, divided our lives up into lots of parts. 
But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit. 
He only has use of his eyes. 
I have to trust the orchestra, and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself. 
We were experimenting with type, with illustration, with photos. And we had fun. 
And he drives a very nice car. 
Biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses, and take advice from them, design advice. 
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again. 
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. 
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice. 
And critically, what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa. 
The children were killed on the spot. 
For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting. 
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999. 
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time. 
"That's me, my husband and son. 
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors. 
This is on the 6 train in New York City. 
Let's take a closer look. 
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth. 
(Video) DR: Hey. 
It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article -- where, the time, the website. 
Snakes are occasionally born with legs. 
This is not the end, this is the beginning of the end." 
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling, restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling? 
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. 
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid. 
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do. 
Unlike the occupants of the universe, the universe itself is not wasteful. 
They've changed the world. 
And this is a timely issue. 
What would have happened if he was in the other group? 
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services. 
He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do. 
And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park, the music would fade to silence, and the play button would disappear. 
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way? 
Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati. 
Just look at the advertisements. 
After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. 
Because living so healthily was killing me. 
And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. 
It's not good. 
The pithiest answer to the question "why?" 
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time. 
And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it. 
Darwin is a great example of this. 
You need a model to understand them. 
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. 
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates, I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter) Because they became my only friends, they became my friends, because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated, but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up. 
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?" 
I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here, yesterday, to London. 
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley. 
Female Voice: Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light. 
All right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford, we were able to take John there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera. 
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life. 
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992, the combined wealth of the people on the Forbes 400 list -- and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans -- was 300 billion dollars. 
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. 
I love this idea that came from the village level: three keys to unlock that warehouse. 
We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. 
Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people. 
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N. 
(Laughter) Torture, very funny. 
We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita -- the saddest place on Earth. 
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake. 
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. 
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same. 
They go back and solar-electrify their own village. 
This ship sank 1,500 years ago. 
And then he has to go even further. 
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. 
But first thing, when you see dots like this, you have to ask yourself: from where do the data come? 
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. 
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it. 
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?" 
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. 
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality. 
Do another three hours' work. 
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. 
I call it the hockey puck. 
I love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium. 
from somewhere in America. 
And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. 
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery. 
Through my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. 
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. 
All this to tell you that if my father became a forger, actually, it was almost by accident. 
We've got airplanes, highway lanes, interior design and horoscope signs. 
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died. 
Okay, most of you. 
And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart? 
It's about the size of a rugby ball. 
Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now. 
That's basically the difference. 
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe. 
Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself?" 
I wish for food for my children. 
They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now, please. 
Sometimes, it's all at once. 
Don't worry, we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many, many other problems in the region. 
They would be received by a second ship, and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case, of 250 billion herring in a period of about a minute. 
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant. 
Some people can hang on to five. 
This is something only humans can do. 
But take the example of heparin. 
He started a motorbike company. 
Child: Whoa! Look at that snake! 
Like for example, applying the Internet, which is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa, to bringing health information to developing areas of the world. 
(Applause) That scares some people. That excites me. 
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes, rather than using heated sheets. 
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes." 
The other thing to do is to knock the product, attack the brand myth, as we've said. 
A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology. 
The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened. 
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. 
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. 
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example, calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths to sustain this economy. 
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems. 
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that, but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV, it was about ice caps melting, wars going on around the world, earthquakes, hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse, and then eventually did collapse, and so many of us losing our homes, or our jobs, or our retirements, or our livelihoods. 
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity. 
So it's really quite big. 
Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. 
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. 
And even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it -- something from a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. 
That hit me so hard, telling these people that had been through this experience. 
Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf. 
You've got the disorganized rebels over here. 
And then we bring that into software, and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is. 
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories. 
With public art, I could also make cut glass. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy. 
It attracted 42,000 people, and we showcased 51 films. 
What if there are truths about justice, and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated, partook of that form of justice? 
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right? 
In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. 
Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air. 
There's 250 pavilions. 
And reading is just about impossible.

They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. 
What if that wild bird flies by again?

The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda, they start like this, with negative other-izing. 
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. 
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane. 
The first principle is: it's the politics that matters. 
So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. 
We should focus on the positive. 
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?

But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. 
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet. 
I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. 
In every little cubic centimeter of space, whether or not there's stuff, whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever, there's still energy, even in the space itself. 
(Laughter) It's called oxytocin. 
There is the color red and the color black, representing the constant change from day to night. 
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45, the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt. 
If there is publication bias, if small negative trials have gone missing in action, you can see it on one of these graphs.

So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case. 
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat.

And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas, where they happened. 
So with disease models like these, we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster. 
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into is that, if you double the size of the organism, you actually only need 75 percent more energy. 
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. 
Combine that with a world value survey, which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world. 
And then, stage nine. 
Why is that the case? 
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. 
If you look 50 years into the future, the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three, with some wind, with some other things, but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. 
And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. 
We also need the choices for people. 
So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be. 
So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance, by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni. 
It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" -- a place of extremes and extreme contrasts.
