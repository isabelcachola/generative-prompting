They have urban streetscapes, but suburban parking ratios. 
It's a great country with lots of people. 
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing? 
So there's multiple databases. 
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder, and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. 
At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. 
Anyone know where that was? Wasn't Port Arthur, no. 
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. 
And the guys that have not only means, but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding, go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf. 
Now, if I had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting, and there have of course been many other examples, and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation, I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR. 
So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination, so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn't really think was possible before. 
I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. 
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light -- the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power. 
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not, so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries. 
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom, last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation. 
I might like it more than you like it, because I know how bloody hard it is to do it. 
Through Haiti Rewired, through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity, AIDG, there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. 
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking, to think in a long-term, more consequential way. 
Fear is the enemy of play. 
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with. 
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and virus, simple organisms. 
Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. 
Now in the 20th century, there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders, and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders, practically none of them can be considered to be cured. 
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes. 
The very feeling of terror is global. 
Thank you very much. 
Or I'd make eye contact with everyone -- that was really creepy; that didn't work at all. 
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. 
What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting, blogging, following you, watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. 
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions. 
You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60, and today I'd like to talk about their relationship. 
I think that's a new species." 
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay? 
And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables. 
In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. 
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver, and that result in the embodiment of you. 
Anybody check that today? 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. 
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. 
Let's see. 
It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. 
It’s not so much psychological, it’s vascular, and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. 
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them? 
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough. 
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world. 
I prayed for them, and things started to change. 
And every seven sets of seven years, the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. 
The Pew Institute, which produces good data on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States, says that -- and I think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. 
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it. 
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. 
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. 
And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera. 
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. 
I flew to Cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. 
So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right? 
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. 
Let me demonstrate this over here. 
PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies, they're not events. 
They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources. 
This technology is intra-active. 
It is possible and it is not difficult. 
We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct, and the same is true of all physical objects. 
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road. 
Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive, but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years. 
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon. 
I'm convinced that in 30 years, when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags, we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy. 
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. 
So the question we really need to ask ourselves is, why, given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual, never mind the scale of the societal problem, why are there no effective treatments? 
And so I did things like travel to South Africa, where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political, social and economic context. 
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war. 
It's very, very simple. It's not rocket science. 
And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. 
So presently, we are doing the following: First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps. 
Every time a forest is cut down, every time a marsh is filled in, it is a potential lab that goes with it, and which we will never, ever recover. 
I mean, she knows I'm not a dog. 
You will see the records that we have. 
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided. 
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give, especially if the problem was never going away. 
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. 
So nature has this self-similar structure. 
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one. 
The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are. 
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake. 
I want to let you know it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me, because I faced a lot of obstacles. 
And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection. 
Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong. 
And what does that mean? 
If we remove half of the data, we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is. 
And again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. 
The barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. 
And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs. 
But, in recent years, at the time of this conversation, they had nothing but long periods of drought, and then flash flooding, and then more drought. 
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. 
This is what wars look like when they continue. 
If we knew, God would not be God. 
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long. 
And so we did just the opposite. 
(Applause) This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it. 
People might actually start sending out agendas. Imagine! 
But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold, the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose? 
You know? What do you do here? 
CL: And so she's phenomenal. 
Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen. 
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels. 
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous." 
Isn't that terrific? 
I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body. 
So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before. 
They're everywhere. 
We'd actually met online before -- not the way you're thinking. 
Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money. 
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. 
And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. 
First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945. 
And so I had this T.V. show. 
And the extraneous ornament is seen as really, essentially, criminal. 
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region. 
You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked. 
So the bad news is that we all get sick. 
We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know, having the idea that robots could really have emotions, or that robots could be living creatures -- I think is going to be hard for us to accept. 
Now, some of you might be thinking, "Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower. 
And something a little bit more experimental: this is a light fixture for Swarovski, and what it does is, it changes shape. 
And with some look-alikes, they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not. 
Every season, these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love. 
And so in Japan, I began to experiment with people. 
Those were major breakthroughs. 
And I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet. 
They serve food to poor people. 
Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would? 
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked. 
He's both a very well known American geek, but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya. 
The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later. 
We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right, and none of them would make tumors. 
That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. 
We may be able to use them differently. 
That's the idea. 
It's not about low cost. 
Many people helped me along the way to get here. 
There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash. 
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. 
There are 12. 
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right. 
What we look for in firemen, in climbers, in policemen, and what we should look for in intervention, is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff, not people who jump into a burning room, but who weigh their risks, weigh their responsibilities. 
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible. 
So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment. 
And I was telling these kids, 120 of them -- they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor -- and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and you can't see them at night especially. 
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital. 
The answer is no, there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. 
Very simple. 
They merely decided to lead them. 
The second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system. 
And there are a couple of answers to that question. 
Korea shows you what's possible in education. 
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology "emotion capture," as opposed to just motion capture. 
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy, in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. 
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington. 
Her job, her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber. 
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. 
And that's her dad. 
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world. 
So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses? 
They know mental as well as physical suffering. 
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. 
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor. 
Well, we could try to farm more land. 
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago. 
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. 
So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games. 
From my teachers, my family and my community, I had all the necessary support to become a musician. 
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition. 
It's not that strove for mediocrity, it's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F. 
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure 
If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment, then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. 
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent, we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else. 
And that's a belief that I share. 
But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that, I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing. 
By encouraging them to run after it, I was putting them at risk -- of persecution, of heartbreak. 
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks. 
Back on a spring day in 1889, the federal government held what they called a land run. 
If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more, but I've applied them to myself for over a decade, and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is, I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives, so that when you go away and you're making your next absolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think, "Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense in our new world after midnight." Thank you very much. 
There were hundreds of people involved in that. 
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players. 
One of those ways might be better diagnosis. 
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life. 
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films. 
(Applause) The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. 
We were experimenting with type, with illustration, with photos. And we had fun. 
I've been a civil servant, and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well. 
You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community. 
(Applause) Hi. So, this chap here, he thinks he can tell you the future. 
I go to Chrysokeras. 
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order. 
Having goals is important, because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction, you need to know where you're going and why. 
This time, not only did my collectors disappear, the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. 
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder, it's going to be with me. 
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice, for patients, for doctors, for the public. 
I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see. 
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. 
And my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality. 
Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs. 
(Applause) So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. 
Okay. I do too. 
Given the computer model, we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. 
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. 
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. 
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. 
It's not. I show you here some slides, some frames from the video, and at the last moment before he hits the glass, he puts his feet in front, and then he bangs against the glass. 
(Music) ♫ Billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ Strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ Panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫ ♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫ ♫ Must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ On a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ She was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫

We know our societies have to radically change. 
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. 
And then do it again and do it again and do it again. 
Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored. 
(Applause) I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase. 
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter) So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories. 
I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers. 
And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive. 
If you're like most people, just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before. 
(Laughter) Now, there's kind of two issues here. 
Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see. 
And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths. 
And then, when she closed the door, Grandma said, "No, no, no, no. 
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band. 
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. 
I mean, you should see that. 
Whilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology, something that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between. 
They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so, the sum total of human information. 
So, this deck is bought here. Sorry. 
In Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027. 
(Laughter) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame. 
And I often look at things as though they're food. 
Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce that the games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro. 
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black, the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations, and you get these peculiar pictures. 
After that, all bets are off. 
And remember, to create a place of character and quality, you have to be able to define space. 
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared. 
(Laughter) Yeah, that's a terrifying result. 
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people -- to house, for example, the chronically sick. 
After I got back, I said, okay, this is amazing, what we found. 
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. 
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education. 
But no, I'm not. I own stocks. 
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit, along that summit ridge that you see up there, and I was down here in Camp Three. 
It mattered to me. 
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss," which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG. 
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year, generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner. 
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. 
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. 
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them, and the definition will appear in the illustration corner. 
That's why most people turn to storytelling, is to escape. 
At that point I also had a son. 
But today it's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid. 
She's 86 years old. She's frail. 
So early on, we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic. 
Let's imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads, but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: That was astonishing. 
That's real time. 
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do. 
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay. 
It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334, and it is where the Lakota now live. 
It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation." 
Now Judy and I -- I have to say -- totally related to each other. 
This film was not about the Internet, but it could not have been made without it. 
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. 
It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. 
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. 
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources and the focus to it, what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery? 
We think about energy scarcity. 
It's about ultra-low cost. 
I mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times, they went ahead and did it anyway. 
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance, I think. 
We would have no pains, but also no joys. 
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. 
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries. 
Third, that thou shall have reverence. 
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter." 
Using a grid the size of your thumb, with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain, Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm. 
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments. 
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter) So — (Applause) — So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter) We've done it in 300 communities around the world. 
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. 
And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. 
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on. 
And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise. 
"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED. 
There's poverty, you give money to help -- no one asked me for a donation. 
We are starting to understand that. 
Imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room. 
It couldn't be further from the truth for me. 
And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? 
I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. 
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK. 
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away. 
And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this. 
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C. 
But right now, depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there. 
This experience raised a lot of questions, among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. 
A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it. 
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say, I just paid a lot of money for that reading. 
They are multinational, as I say, they are branded, they have a clear identity, so they don't get lost in a busy world. 
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. 
But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights; others have problems with sound sensitivity. 
What's your hope/depression level on this? 
And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society, the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one. 
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months. 
Audience: (Shouts) (Laughter) (Shouts) (Laughter) Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. 
So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something. 
(Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. 
No different from the dog barking. 
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' " And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help." 
Alfred Mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this. 
As you can see there's only yellow terrain. 
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles. 
These mosses are taken from the forest; they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists, to make arrangements and make hanging baskets. 
That picture on the left is just staggering to me. 
And then, of course, design is never done. 
It's more than enough reason for pessimism. 
Independents, on the whole, don't get elected to office. 
And I have to say, thank God. 
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush. 
Your sexual function improves. 
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent. 
Who would do that? 
No refueling means you can seal them up and they're not going to be a proliferation risk, and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores. 
These structures are called cilia, and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. 
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery -- two key motivational things that increase productivity, through play. 
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. 
It's important to remember that we evolved. 
The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers. 
Let's add European countries in blue, and you can see there's quite a variety. 
Nobody knows. 
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States. 
I was having a really bad day. (Laughter) For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions. 
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world on your smartphone, watching your rhythm -- that's incredible, and it's with us today. 
Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?" 
(Laughter) So what I did actually is to study this problem, and I found something quite surprising. 
We find microbial life in every part of the planet: in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing. 
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning. 
I made it to China on February 15, 2006. 
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. 
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT, but we know it wasn't good for you and me. 
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers, but they need to be elevated to software strategists. 
And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell, you just change the sequence of the staples. 
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together, I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today. 
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot. 
If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints? 
Right on the slopes of the Koariti. 
You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel -- and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual. 
It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research. 
People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news, they thought, "Ah, this isn't real." 
This is something I did for Sony in 1996. 
By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from. 
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years. 
And Dick and Harry repeat this. 
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team. 
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year. 
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. 
It always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes. 
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it. 
Can you imagine saying that? 
So they'll probably think it's five years away. 
Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights. 
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. 
It's forming a pipe. 
So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title -- I'll come to this a little later -- and perhaps the addition of a new word into the English language. 
We can all picture astronauts in space. 
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was. 
So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. 
And most of them couldn't say. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much -- "Fingertips." 
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator? 
(Applause) Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque? 
Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance, have really opened the designer's mind. 
We greet with our hands. 
Take your finger and draw this line. 
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher. 
If not, then why build it? 
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out. 
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. 
The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. 
Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure, the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play. 
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it. 
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information. 
Again, there were some misunderstandings. 
Haters gonna hate. 
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. 
And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. 
The great thing about our leaders is that, should they not only have passion in their belly, which practically all of them have, they're also very innovative. 
It was made of cast iron. 
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring. 
Very scary. 
I hope you notice the coincidence here. 
And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. 
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. 
A year after this treatment -- in fact, this is his baseline MRI. 
It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries; we made the world more cooperative. 
So it's very interesting. 
This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. 
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on. 
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school. 
That means "ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages." 
Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter. 
And like children, they believe that we are in severe need of assistance. 
In about the length of this session, you would have counted all 5,000. 
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this. 
And I'd love to talk about this, but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn't need much talking about -- but I guess I may be very wrong about that, and everything else that I've said. 
But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. 
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he's got to go to school. 
And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala. 
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet, innocent and beautiful fresh face. 
In parts of the world where there are no bees, or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. 
"I" passes insensibly into a "we," "my" becomes "our" and individual faith loses its central importance. 
Some I even considered like my second home. 
At this point in her life, she's suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia. 
But, if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more, then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you. 
What megafauna, you say? 
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. 
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe, which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. 
So you believe in the threat of climate change. 
And Anna said, "Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. 
This is a training ground where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow. 
And so what you're watching is the birth of stars. 
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example. 
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate. 
I think this is a revolution. 
And you know, during war time, there are militaries, armies, that are moving around. 
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, "A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?" 
When you stack people in rows, the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour. 
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher, who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny -- it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox, at a time when there was no smallpox program. 
But it isn't just about growing, because we all are part of this jigsaw. 
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this: We need to learn to love the flawed, imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them. 
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. 
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams, his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces -- that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it, the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope, with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. 
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents, and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents. 
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?" 
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. 
(Laughter) I have never been more terrified -- until now. 
But mostly I'm entranced by it. 
In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT -- this is at the media lab. 
And what this guy had done: he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches. 
And we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone. 
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. 
(Laughter) And running gives me a lot of energy. 
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. 
(Applause) As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design? 
Basically, we get it out of mines. 
It's like a traveling show. 
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe, curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions. 
These are truly miraculous things that happen. 
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south. 
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet. 
"Why don't you try?" 
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen. 
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine at 740 feet, I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level. 
A man by the name of David came to the throne, and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. 
So for other kinds of operations, there's definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches. 
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food. 
"You mean, like, in the car?" 
(Laughter) There's a whole programming language and robotics tool, so if you want to teach someone how to program, kid, adult, whatever it is. 
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. 
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. 
Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do. 
We're going to call him "Ted." 
Everyone has done something. 
How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military. 
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for. 
But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. 
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect, you can connect these two lines, and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do. 
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes, but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. 
Let's start with faster. 
To do this would require a single statute, a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections, a statute of citizen-funded campaigns, and there's any number of these proposals out there: Fair Elections Now Act, the American Anti-Corruption Act, an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections, an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act. 
Lewis, have the courage to go in there, because we are going to look after you every moment of it." 
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous. 
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. 
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical? 
And electric fields are not magnetism. 
(Applause) Invest in education. 
We have a gut on a chip. 
There has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth. 
Can there really be only one interface? There can't. 
So I discovered some very interesting things. 
I'm not always successful, and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating, because you feel like you're writing into a void, or you feel like no one cares. 
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water. 
This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it. 
These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton, and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground, they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands. 
Stanley McChrystal: I think that Rick said something very important. 
But from February to April this year, Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. 
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day. 
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson. 
So you feel this massive heat, and you go, "I want to get out of the way." 
We know and expect that we'll see that. 
E: Happy birthday to you. 
It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding, reveals the strengths and weaknesses, and yes, like some of the speakers before, the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and it does then become, that process, part of normalization. 
And others, also connected to the Internet, used it as an instrument of democracy. 
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here. 
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon, and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building. 
We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this. 
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. 
Ideas truly are what make the world go round. 
I felt empty and full, hot and cold, euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer; it can occupy multiple states at the same time. 
(Laughter) You try them all in order: Mmm...? 
And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session. 
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? 
So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. 
And I know I've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere, but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced. 
(Applause) Hi. I am an architect. 
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. 
When I was an assistant D.A., and when I was a federal prosecutor, I looked at the cases in front of me, and I generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience. 
Okay, we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to live in a world with slavery? 
So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?" 
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. 
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. 
Because, if you haven't noticed from my skin color, I'm white, and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. 
(Laughter) Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter) I think there's more memory in my watch. 
Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories. 
We also created a boardroom, and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan, and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building. 
So David's top five presentation tips. 
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine. 
And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background, and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by. 
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. 
(Applause) Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky. 
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. 
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation, unusual levels of creativity? 
These are places where mosquitos breed. 
They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor. 
If I go out in the open ocean environment, virtually anywhere in the world, and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface, most of the animals -- in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light. 
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different, which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information, so that they began to get communities of cells. 
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. 
Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time. 
And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. 
Now this happened in the past, so I'm going to make that "told." 
Now, the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses; they're actually giving them less than they expect. 
He's even here today. 
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work. 
But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago, and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. 
And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way, make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us. Here's another one. 
Now look at the Moon. 
But in each case, I didn't design the form. 
We know that that works. 
E: Ooooowww. 
All the rest went to the top one percent. 
So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your working memory out for a ride. 
And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages, but never mastered them. 
But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward, of course -- were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Even now we are in touch through Facebook. 
And some people will fund their entire Lego habit by selling the little guy, but then you have no guys in your ships. 
And that's why the Ottoman Empire in its last decades turned into a proto-democracy, a constitutional monarchy, and freedom was a very important political value at the time. 
Canal Street, I know. 
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. 
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. 
It's never been shown. 
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air but, what's going on? 
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea, which was, well I'm still not heating the metal now, with this kind of engine, but I'm still reheating all the air. 
We are bending the curve. 
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would. 
What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump, to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are, having kind of that special moment, where we connect the dots actually at the pump. 
Do you trust elementary school teachers?" 
By our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive. 
And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. 
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic. 
(Laughter) And therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions? 
So she did that for two more months. 
Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. 
And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched. 
This is my apartment. 
In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world. 
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. 
So, when my wife came in and she could tell you're awake. 
One, two, three. Go! 
they say, "Go away." 
And I want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything. 
All of that is over. 
So this shows ... 
We all need to be pit crews now. 
So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note -- is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. 
OK, here we go. 
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water. 
It's called healthcare -- a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health, not just manage disease. 
(Laughter) Imagine, you being part of a network where, you're maybe at a sporting event, and you're sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle. 
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there, and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. 
They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it. 
You can do bigger things. 
And so, I have here what we call the "paradigms." 
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. 
It hasn't changed as we were growing up. 
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. 
That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right? 
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!" (Laughter) So, it's not that we have good words and bad words. 
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard, he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?" 
So we need to change that institutional culture. 
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore. 
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system. 
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. 
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. 
And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital. 
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen, and those points in space are communicated. 
If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish." 
No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges, meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that: 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free. 
I think there are ways -- and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions. 
They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. 
So I think that's all my time, I'm over it, and I'm going to end my talk right there. 
And if we zoom in again, actually in the case of bone, the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material that's part organic, part inorganic. 
Alzheimer's disease: there's five million people affected, and you can check vital signs, activity, balance. 
You can see this is a major shipping airport, and there's all kinds of activity there. 
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure, experimentally. 
So 37 is our target audience. 
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN six and a half years ago. 
But if you look across these space types, you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another. 
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper, need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. 
I would just give the inspiration and that's my job. 
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability. 
D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested? 
15 seconds studio. 
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions? 
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality. 
I'm just speaking broadly and critically -- it's not very appealing to people that play online video games, because the graphics are not yet equivalent to -- I mean, these are very nice pictures, but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4. 
And we know that from Spain, we know that "sol y sombra." 
(Laughter) A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome. 
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. 
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting. 
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy, so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie." 
You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. 
If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us. 
He said that by having compassion and having love, you can conquer the world. 
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now. 
And what he does is -- (Laughter) he spends a week at a time with a family. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But who should care? The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls, educators, gamers, filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to, who can dance, who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs. 
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people. 
So this -- (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) This is not only useful for stadia. We can use that also in open-air places and streets, and we've been working on the City of the Future in Masdar, which is in the United Emirates, Abu Dhabi. 
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care. 
And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid, resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else, versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics. 
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. 
So it's not far-fetched to say that, at some point, online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. 
And it is important. 
And we feed them -- sterilely of course -- with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food -- and we grow them in incubators. 
It informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women. 
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini. 
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters, and then I realized very, very quickly, I had a huge problem on my hands. 
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about: this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth." 
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. 
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. 
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying? 
So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. 
After exploring recently-abandoned buildings, I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast: your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church -- any man-made structures around you. 
So, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs, high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. 
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. 
So you're now about 14 billion years into this. 
So would I take the pill? In an instant. 
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India. 
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. 
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick. 
These are 80- to 90-year-olds. 
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page. 
A second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy can become aristocracy. 
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. 
Now, here's the bad news. 
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. 
So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this. 
And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood. 
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. 
And The Police's "Synchronicity" cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. 
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. 
Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices. 
Thank you very much. 
This is not what it's all about. 
Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is. 
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. 
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario. 
But not so with Márquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own, which is an astonishing compliment. 
And I got scared. 
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. 
Put all these three together, and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace. 
(Trumpet) The trumpet. 
So when I first set out to work on task allocation, my first question was, "What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks? 
Because that event was the Scientific Revolution, ever since which our knowledge of the physical world, and of how to adapt it to our wishes, has been growing relentlessly. 
And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law." 
But there is a curious asymmetry here. 
And that directly increased student wellbeing. 
I've always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook. 
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. 
And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you're trying to do that, and then the bodies are coming past you, it humbles you, and you also realize very, very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. 
Because every step is dangerous. 
Between November and May, Rio's completely packed. 
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material. 
That's how we process information. 
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides, nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. 
It's all very one-dimensional. 
In the 1950s, Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat. 
I thank you very much for your time. 
We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug. 
But we've centralized these bureaucracies. 
So activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all. 
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. 
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR, which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things. 
So we classify people by what they picked, and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers, which brain areas are differentially active. 
And that's what I'm going to show you. 
Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. 
(Laughter) What a mess -- have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this? 
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure. 
(Laughter) Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones. 
So you have these three mysteries. 
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. 
The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too. 
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And also, could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with? 
There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. 
I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are most of all is not our minds and not our bodies and not what happens to us, but how we respond to what happens to us. 
It became the media platform of 300 million readers. 
And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor, boil them up, use the oil. 
He said, "Before I say yes to that, I need to check with management." 
It has 40 different components put together by other people. 
So there is no mistake. 
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more. 
And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal. 
The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. 
And she was really crucial in getting the message in. 
Next January comes and people might feel that if they save more, they have to spend less, and that's painful. 
And we did that experiment, that you see here. 
It's not just that they're damn cute; it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are. 
(Applause) It's a very smart, smart audience. 
And again we just finished the ECB -- actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project, where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park, which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric -- the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city. 
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. 
And that's why actually in the 19th century the Ottoman Empire, which then covered the whole Middle East, made very important reforms -- reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status, accepting a constitution, accepting a representative parliament, advancing the idea of freedom of religion. 
And so whether that genius is placed into -- technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West -- or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth, is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. 
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet, which was an impossibility. 
I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to "bask." 
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound. 
I knew Dr. von Braun very well. 
(Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated. 
We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of! 
I allow them to go there and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way, how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. 
So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative. 
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily. 
And really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery, two of which -- a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin, an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma -- will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in July of this year. 
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue, believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. 
All countries spy. 
Now, I don't get a wish, but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish. 
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates. 
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. 
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at, as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. 
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us. 
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well. 
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes. 
JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it? 
I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. 
Lest you think I exaggerate, here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology. 
So therefore, we have these two metabolisms, and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart, and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. 
With shovels in hand, they started to dig. 
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist. 
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us. 
Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now, all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said, "Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?" 
The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. 
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org, it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time. 
And when Noah had done built his Ark, I understand that somebody began to rend a song. 
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. 
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? 
Remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff. 
And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. 
But most importantly, we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems and human scale self-assembly systems. 
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. 
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks, which I kind of missed, was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in. 
It's a very great pleasure to fly around. 
They named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements. 
And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. 
What good is it?" 
There's a lot of work to be done after that. 
I would drive it and demand things from it. 
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. 
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. 
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across. 
The average actually, the record is in Singapore. 
Beyond these sorts of things, a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do. 
But there's large fractions in other different languages, and if you don't know those languages, you can't access it. 
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: "I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me." 
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD. 
How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease, early onset of disease, and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time? 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael. 
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood. 
And this really became the template for moving forward. 
So we start at the top, and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red, and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice. 
And they say, "We'll, we're going to do what we did last year this year." 
Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. 
They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada. 
We can choose a greener future, and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. 
Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now. 
Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker, I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers, that kids are particularly interested in this, in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro-controllers and build robots. 
We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page, because that's how readers perceive it. 
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000, or just 1,500 dollars with certainty. 
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. 
We also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum, so it's all one continuous change in the massing, but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms. 
In my case it's quarterly. 
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles. 
And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses, and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid, the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells -- mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks. 
When you see grumpy customer service, point that out to them. 
And this is my favorite line from the article. 
If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked, first came the infrastructure, then came the industry around it, the brothels -- it's a bit like the Internet today, right? — and everything else that worked with it: bars, saloons, etc. 
Now it had a sense of place. 
He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. 
So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. 
These are the chambers of your head and neck that vibrate, and they actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels. 
People stink! 
It's experienced by people occasionally. 
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked. 
So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have, at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. 
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals, are now, as they say, in diaspora. 
In the early '70s, Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas, but very few biologists believed it. 
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise. 
Basically, she's a deejay. 
But that's what's lacking in a poor country. 
So what's my wish? 
And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said, "We could do that," and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi. 
All of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us, really, by science filtered through the media. 
We can start, if you want, by understanding -- it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work. 
(Laughter) But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm. 
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. 
We dropped them gently in. 
One out of 10 are saving enough. 
So it runs frequently, the entire hospital, just on a generator. 
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining. 
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute relative to the people standing there. 
Brilliant work. 
It became a national park. 
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity. 
This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. 
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip. 
AK: It works good. 
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience and, say, increase your price tag. 
Now multiply it by 100. 
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. 
So to help us with this benchmarking, I'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index. 
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. 
But if what you're looking for is serendipity, if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed, our main philosophy is to look to our social networks, to look for our friends. 
The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. 
So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front, and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy, so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull, and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder, I could control four meters of absorbent. 
And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart. 
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times, we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you. 
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. 
And this made me really sad. 
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. 
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump. 
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?" 
And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed, and saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again." 
We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. 
So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy. 
His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done, and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. 
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. 
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things, put them on the Net, and then download, print them and bind them, and end up with books again. 
Maybe some of them are here now. 
They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had a fiber-optic telephone system, long before it had reached Western countries. 
There it is. 
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. 
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. 
And the reason for this, unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of, is because perception is in any case leaky. 
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. 
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability. 
And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes. 
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position. 
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -- jealously insisting on no other gods. 
So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves, but we all know what it's like to be afraid. 
The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer, GBM. 
But that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects. 
With his effort, and the support of his mother, his family and his community, he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. 
And if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense, like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces, which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them, these amazing things started appearing. 
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. 
There's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations. 
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. 
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive. 
There's something missing from these studies. 
He's going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working. 
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods. 
(Laughter) But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation, it wasn't like that. 
He died broken by history. 
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. 
Stepping onto the sidewalk, I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. 
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. 
And you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system, but either way, we don't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes. 
Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families. 
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. 
It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying, "Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now." 
And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. 
This is based on the structure of a diamond. 
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces. 
Whereas the young, small colonies -- the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable. 
Lastly, I want to talk about growth. 
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are. 
And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share. 
And with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. 
But, to cut a long story short, I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. 
Some countries that might have clean water supplies, so that you can't get waterborne transmission: you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there. 
The cells genetically know what to do, and they start beating together. 
I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier. 
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff. 
So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. 
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. 
So even before that impact was known, even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution, scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes: Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life. 
They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools. 
It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning. 
Let's get him working on building different things. 
Japan was the first non-Western society to embrace it. 
You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St. 
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community. 
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. 
There are lines in front of the one on the right, and there are lines behind the one on the left, and so it takes it into different planes. 
(Laughter) We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger. 
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind, that you cannot measure history. 
And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms, no blind people running around to find each other. 
Now, let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences, it can drive the science. 
Again, this is no mere hypothetical. 
And this to me was an important message from Rand. 
Deneb is there. I can tell. 
(Applause) In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti, my former professor of art history, and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci. 
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this." 
Twenty-two people are graduating, and all 22 are going to college. 
'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you. 
At that time I found myself in a strange situation. 
Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance. 
DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod. 
We're all victims of terrorism. 
True symbiosis. 
Now, when you were a young boy in this school, what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become? 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really. 
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. 
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky. 
People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. 
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything. 
Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. 
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. 
And I really wanted this story to be about three things: I wanted it to be about abundance, about diversity and about resilience. 
And we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times. 
I've explored, experienced, and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. 
It's also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. 
In 1990, exports from China to the United States: 15 billion dollars. 
CA: But is there a risk here? 
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image, so I got a look-alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination. 
In those days, we were living in a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi. 
(Laughter) Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century Turkish figs for breakfast. 
And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. 
We have to accept that there will be hazards. 
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed? 
And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain. 
And the child said, "No, I can't." 
(Laughter) Okay, so that guy is actually still with us. 
So here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress, the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve. 
He had one good eye. 
But are they really? 
So the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical, or accurate perceptions. 
So I was the oldest person in the house. 
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view. 
Your skin regenerates every two weeks. 
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. 
And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here: ask your government for an integrated food policy. 
So you're probably all wondering: the cave. 
If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe, then you will put less emphasis on strong government. 
Now, one important thing: This is not a dystopian project. 
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear. 
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam, but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. 
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me. 
These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure, so there's no inclination for the fission products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident. 
Yes? Good? 
So of course I had to be interested in human rights, and equality and justice, and using my elbows! 
But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere, with people to talk to about those books, this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing. 
There is no attempt to structure the experience, to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it. 
So this is all very prototypey at this point. 
I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox, the idea that in order to actually hit your target, you have to aim at something slightly skew from it. 
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? 
To the top right of the graph, are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being, but they're using a lot of planet to get there. 
And we knew that we were losing CO2. 
I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics. 
And I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles, giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates. 
By creating wealth? 
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes. 
(Laughter) This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time, and I thought -- you know, fly all night, I looked up, and I thought, wow, how clean. 
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed? 
Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this? 
And they had lungs. 
We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior. 
and — (Laughter) — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody, and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising, raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh, and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me, and I think, "He looks Bangladeshi," — (Laughter) — and I just have those two facts, and I just think, "This could work somehow." (Laughter) And then I go out, and they work on me for the rest of the night, and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there 
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity. 
But then finally, one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea. 
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. 
And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power? 
And I will go you one further. 
Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness. 
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe, like Solidarity in Poland, when I was in my teens. 
Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth, there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past. 
My body was consumed by pain. 
It's the only object they want. 
These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight. 
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology. 
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity. 
She did so much. She was a playwright. 
How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We" to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication? 
It works against the left and the right, and that, you might say, is good news. 
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur, because there isn't a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude, what are the positive emotions. 
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. 
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account. 
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori, which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace, which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon, and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning. 
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing. 
But it happens without awareness such that you don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring. 
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important. 
And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together, these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. 
How did look at the stuff in your life? 
Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. 
They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. 
They had no logo and no identity, but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis. 
Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. 
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. 
Where did you find them? Are they real? You faked it. 
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. 
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics? 
It makes a farce of our idea of equality. 
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. 
This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night, a few months ago, decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park. 
We did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks. 
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically, maybe getting sidetracked, that was fun. 
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. 
Woman: Have you ever been? 
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. 
By 2050 though, it could become efficient, connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos, factories and buildings all relying on a modern, secure and resilient electricity system. 
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?" 
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it. 
Now, a fusion plant would actually be quite cost-effective and it also would be quite safe. 
The Infinity Burial Project, an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. 
AB: Yeah. 
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe. 
And this is another thing that I did -- you know working -- everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in -- a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing. 
I was really worried. 
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket. 
Due to his instability, Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick. 
Well, then we get to this image. 
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible, and we look at what actually happens, we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does. 
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion, there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life. 
They're not going to be smart. 
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion, but it's also involved in tons of other processes, like memory, language, attention, even anger, disgust and pain. 
She has become part of the solution, not the problem. 
He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque. 
These were brilliant, driven men who accomplished amazing things. 
It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. 
This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course, those are 
When I was in college, I decided to study engineering, like him. 
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things. 
DH: I don't get it. (Applause) (Laughter) DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks. 
The interesting thing about studying cognition has been that we've been limited, in a way. 
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy, the official copy, of the gay agenda. 
The first day it was just wild. And then we said, "Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one, but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in. 
His is the little hand. 
So in the search box I typed in "Mother's Day," and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website, many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself. 
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus, killing certain species of trees in the forest. 
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding, people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads, dumping them in the forms. 
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet." 
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service, to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management. 
So we have three steps. 
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred, that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. 
And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister -- which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium -- and a clothespin. He taped them all together, ran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?" 
Even on my journey up here -- the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time. 
(Laughter) So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator. 
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece. 
UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it. 
You'll say, "How can we trust them?" 
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism. 
He told me that he'd invite the test subject in, and he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there." 
All: ♪ and bring out a prop like Jill Bolte Taylor. ♪ DH: ♪ My time is running over. The clock now says nil. ♪ ♪ I'm saying my words faster. Understand me still. ♪ ♪ I'm too nervous to give this TED Talk. ♪ All: ♪ Don't give up. Rehearse. You're good. ♪ ♪ We'll edit out the mistakes that you make. ♪ ♪ Give your talk. ♪ DH: ♪ I will be big like Amy Cuddy. ♪ All: ♪ Give your talk. ♪ DH: ♪ I will inspire like Liz Gilbert. ♪ All: ♪ Give your talk. ♪ DH: ♪ I will engage like Hans Rosling ♪ 
These things feel very differently. 
He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. 
Just look at the advertisements. 
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles. 
So, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so? 
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. 
(Child shouting) Man 5: Go! 
And people could never get their bags up it. 
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. 
For the past five years, I've been researching, working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older. 
Why not put some of yourself into the work? 
It was about all children. So, we were shameless. 
It's transformational. 
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay? 
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. 
When you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment. 
He said, "Well, I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion." 
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. 
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here? 
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive, what we like to call "supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy. 
It was a media group that had little media plan. 
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere. 
and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster. 
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. 
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do -- adjust the world to match their expectation. 
She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand. 
And the Wolfram stuff -- I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use, because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. 
And will it happen? 
So I built model airplanes. 
When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was? 
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me. 
Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. 
These electric cars are beautiful. 
It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box, but it has no control over the circumstances. 
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less." 
How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years? 
So what you're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene. 
If it comes up tails, you get nothing. 
We're still inventing, and this is what technology is allowing us to do -- it's continually to reinvent ourselves. 
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention, but at a personal level, in a way I can't imagine doing your job. 
Well, what I'm here to say then is, for people who are skeptical about the war, it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. 
This feud has been going on since 1991 in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco, and it involved the deaths of 20 members of the families and 40 others associated with the feud, including hired hit men, innocent bystanders and friends. 
This is what your office should look like, is part of my message here. 
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very, very bright individuals. 
The nuclear envelope breaks down. 
It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today. 
Models are hard to dislodge. 
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book. 
Thank you. 
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... 
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. 
Odd plus even gives you odd. 
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable. 
And that's the area again. 
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. 
And so we struck up a deal. 
That would be bad. 
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance: fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden. 
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere? 
He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it. 
You'd totally be surprised. 
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years, because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth. 
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. 
That then set me off completely to say, Okay, these two are connected. 
"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?" 
And let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other, and they're just perpetually going along this road. 
They get these dossiers full of secret documents. 
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life? 
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve. 
This line of evolution is clearly positive. 
So I am a fisherman, very much, and I used to be able to catch yellowfin. 
Having started the process, my father did not continue. 
I said one day, well, look, if the science says -- this is science, not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there. 
(Laughter) And it's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall, and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about. 
A second reason has to do with peer pressure. 
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. 
It's half a human lifetime away. 
Now profane is the opposite of sacred. 
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. 
And here's his second bit of advice. 
There's no major difference between these religions. 
And you can also have active tails. 
(Applause) And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me, I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. 
Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule. 
He said, "No! It's called "menu" (English), or "menu" (French)." 
Well, there's also another interesting thing. 
This is pitched into the future from 1946, looking at the day all American families have them. 
Malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on Earth, and there's a reason for that. 
And so, I guess you'd say, dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines, I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open-source, the crowd-source, the collaborative network that we have access to within academia, that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients. 
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites, which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering -- what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering -- Audience: Bee? 
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page. 
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner. 
And what pattern do you see here? 
And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. 
Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. 
It's never been done. 
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs, and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales. 
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. 
Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness, just taking photographs. 
Based on this trial, in April of this year, the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. 
Can I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor? 
It does not come for me from research. 
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain. 
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on. 
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great." 
I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters. 
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there. 
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. 
On, more on and then off. 
American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments, but they were eventually drawn into the conflict, and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn. 
God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer. 
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story. 
So at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards. 
The blue whale, it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is, this wonderful, magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. 
You can see the atrium and the ventricles, how blood flows to our arteries and veins. 
I'd been doing this every night I'd been there. 
Pure content and pure form, side by side. 
This may not seem to impress, but technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years, and armaments technology takes you here. 
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter. 
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." 
There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king. 
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago. 
So now, how to choose the metals? 
It's about 100 million such planets. 
When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato, I am interacting with reality, but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato. 
Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain, restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. 
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. 
If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. 
So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. 
Or, are we destined to become something different -- something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment? 
So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA. 
I feel that tug of human exceptionalism, even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species, apart. 
And he surprised me with the answer. 
And everybody's best friend, Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him? 
Both good long-term and short-term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's Freedom, where the whole point of that application is, well, we're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people, with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done. 
OK. 
If I can ask an indiscreet question, how many of you have tattoos? 
So when one-liners were really popular, everybody stole them from one another. 
You stimulate it; it produces a symphony. 
And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund, because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. 
Obviously, there were. 
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient, they have to be affordable. 
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice. 
If we're not processing life, we're not living it. 
And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude, could you touch your tooth? That's good." 
So whatever it was, it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way. 
How do they do it? 
And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ... 
In all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims, the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. 
We do love a good baseline. 
Watch this space. 
More recently, because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer, which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure, to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system, without regard to institutional models. 
And I don't think I'm crazy. 
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. 
Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact, pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like. 
Well, I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. 
I'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is -- The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. 
So while Egyptians were known for their single-digit turnout in elections before the revolution, the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout -- men and women. 
But we have to draw those people in, because this is about education. 
Just like it wasn't TV and only better. 
So here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP. 
And as a result of that experience, in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail, Dr. King came and said with our parents, "What you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born." 
Okay. Great. 
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder -- thank God for technology -- to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words -- which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform -- if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America. 
And using indigo, make it anti-microbial. 
(Laughter) But if you think about it, from my head to my hands to his leg. 
But even the best passive design wouldn't help. 
We see this general bagginess of the structure, the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to learning on the blackboard, and so we think that something has gone wrong. 
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill, taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body, but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention. 
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done. 
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. 
Can we cut down a little bit further, because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard, of how this actually works. 
Because it's not just the mind. 
Once, toward the end of my stay, a student said to me, "Professor, we never think of you as being different from us. 
and help them to improve crop yield. 
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... 
Thank you very much. 
What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke, so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her. 
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data. 
Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs. 
But hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation. 
Now biodegradability is a material property; it is not a definition of environmental benefits. 
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. 
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft, and you're not going to spend that much time on the road. 
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. 
That's the same species. 
That's the natural cycle. 
His photo was remembered by all of us. 
And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future. 
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. 
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen? 
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. 
Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface. 
So we started retouching photos. 
Now I'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit. 
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class, and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally; it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically. 
There are many reasons for these positive developments, but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti-retroviral therapy, the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check. 
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was -- so what happened since then? 
And here's a solar park in Vermont with real data delivering 4.2 watts per square meter. 
It's just that. 
Who is everybody?""Everybody." 
First of all, viruses are pretty complex, but they're also evolving very fast. 
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective, and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005 by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. 
And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. 
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list. 
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. 
And they're in your house. They're in your house. 
So if you look at the psychological literature, these are the four consistent defining components of regret. 
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays, they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo," because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies, that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo) (Laughter) It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do. 
Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going. 
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden. 
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. 
(Applause) So, where are the robots? 
I'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive." 
The telescope is actually built similarly to the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope, except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens, as you would call it as a photographer. 
The sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated, they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter) So it's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this, and the people who are buying, the pirates, are not their customers anyway, because their customers want the real deal. 
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying, "You must understand smart materials now." 
We often won't even notice them. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, Einstein -- Einstein, tell me -- what's your favorite song? 
Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had. 
And then the second lesson, the radical, tactical shift. 
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there." 
(Laughter) This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century. 
It's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here. 
That's not by chance, that's by design. 
And when you degrade the public realm, you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. 
This is the dynamic of mastery. 
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there. 
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru. 
That they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy, that you can do what you set out to do, and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake. 
But I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen, which means I have the American passport, which means I can travel. 
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe. 
And then in moments of high adrenaline, like when something exciting was happening, I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes. 
More energy is coming in than going out, until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun. 
Poker is serious. 
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate, like the jury is, but we're going to need lots more things like it. 
Because what I didn't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal. 
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. 
We ask the question -- the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation. 
They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement. 
And doctors hate it, right? 
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside. 
This is what happens every year. 
And these were intellectuals or statesmen of the 19th century, and later, 20th century, which looked at Europe basically and saw that Europe has many things to admire, like science and technology. 
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again. 
It's seen as the problem now, for most people. 
We are anonymous. We are legion. 
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso, and he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love. 
Gibran Khalil Gibran, when he first started writing, he used Arabic. 
PM: What a change that is. 
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them, just to make sure we understand how, where would they break. 
If these were postcards of nostalgia, ours was a very long farewell indeed. 
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. 
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel, can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time, distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean, that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. 
You could just about go to war and that was about it. 
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. 
In theory, if you program those sufficiently, you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure. 
Because, you see, nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. 
I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it. 
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs. 
Is it possible to experience the stratosphere? 
And I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights. 
And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. 
And in this particular example, what I took is some membrane molecules, mixed those together in the right environment, and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here. 
When I became attorney general, I could look at the system as a whole, and what surprised me is that I found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system -- in police departments, in prosecutors's offices, in courts and in jails. 
The memes are all trying to get copied -- trying, in inverted commas -- i.e., that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will. 
If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things. 
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to. 
This is not about money. 
And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine. 
And then, this is like projects that are harder to build. 
We are the stories we tell ourselves. 
So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer, you created true value. 
That's the short term. That's the flame part. 
Or is man a wolf for man? 
Our relationship is still important. 
And -- (Laughter) -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. 
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection. 
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue. 
But then reality's always unpredictable. 
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. 
The head nurse told me proudly, "You see, our children are very well-behaved." 
All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. 
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it. 
Indeed, the mind can redefine itself, and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva back in the 1970's. 
She got diabetes. Case closed. 
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science, what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs? 
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry? 
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website, we can make an expert network, a social network, that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions. 
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute. 
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. 
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms, to starve to death before reaching land. 
It's natural connective tissue. 
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me, which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document. 
It's going to be very challenging to deal with. 
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. 
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. 
Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government, autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. 
This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them. 
This has actually been, to me, a gift, because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life. 
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources. 
We teach, touch and move. 
And we call that the meme-ome. 
Our world is defined by the pace of change. 
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top. 
(Laughter) So they whip it out. And you see men, they have that black card. 
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories. 
We're based down in Florida. 
I don't know what those other states were doing." 
I can keep up with my friends. 
I didn't have to try to flap my wings. 
And the problem of building it -- when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans, they looked at them and said, "What's this?" 
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. 
So, what's interesting is that their stories were similar, but they were different. 
What should be at the bottom of the list? 
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. 
And so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift, and did we find the missing heat. 
But he looked at me, and he said, "Son" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, "Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat. 
Sometimes they put their lives on the line, because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. 
How does this happen? 
This is in Portland. That is an actual development. 
So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere, and so that's what I'm doing here. 
(Applause) So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side, and living systems on the other side. 
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions. 
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins. 
He called up the local newspaper, he got the interest of an investigative journalist, and that journalist actually found the real rapist, a man who ultimately confessed to this rape, a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes in that area, and when this information was given to the judge, the judge set Titus free. 
The second things is very hot. 
The battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor, Alessandro Volta, at the University of Padua in Italy. 
That means that our countries are getting richer, our companies are getting more efficient, but we're not creating more jobs and we're not paying people, as a whole, more. 
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves. 
And he showed her the lever. 
There are no Jovians. 
That doesn't sell. 
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program, and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership, only to end up being tortured by their heroes. 
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa. 
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. 
I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders, then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen. 
It wins or loses at that point. 
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper. 
On one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. 
We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. 
Some conspiracies really are true. 
Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. 
And this video, which I'm going to let run through, was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago. 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides. 
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. 
It also has to be designed to be very affordable. 
Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. 
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. 
Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it, is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living. 
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow, what makes them happy, how do we make sure that we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive. 
This is at an early stage, but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning, we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the 2020s. 
That's easier for them to find out than who you are. 
And as we danced and danced, and we approached this circle of women, men, women, children, everybody was there. 
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it. 
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space, at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day. 
The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. 
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. 
In one model of heart attack, animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. 
What do I say to them? 
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. 
Given the time difference, I assumed, "Ok, he's out with friends, he will call later." 
But actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior, up until now, up until recent times, up until the last six months, the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances, using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies, those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists. 
And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term. 
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook. 
We can do to the next harvest. 
(Applause) One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. 
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor. 
And so we only need one, so we're hopeful. 
A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms, to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. 
(Laughter) Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368. 
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. 
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them? 
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said. 
I do know that education is a huge part of it. 
After laying in the snow that long a time, he got up and found his way back to the camp. 
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry. 
And he said, "Well, financial services." 
So we came up with one neighborhood typology -- there are several -- called a live-make neighborhood, where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises, with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again, majority 82 percent African-American population. 
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s, 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast. 
So I was on a national television prime-time show. 
So somebody at Time, at the magazine, thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. 
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water. 
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. 
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand." 
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better. 
On the other hand, it's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. 
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right? 
My grandmother grew up in Glasgow, back in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in. 
And grammar is incredibly powerful, because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information, an infinite amount of ideas. 
It's the autobiographical self which some species have, I think. 
And he kind of assumes that, yes, he'll become -- these villagers -- he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements, but, of course, realizes that without the rest of human society, he can barely make a sandwich, let alone a toaster. 
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions, or making invisible macaroni and cheese. 
So even though this looks like a simple toy, the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated. 
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life. 
I literally could not sleep thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders." 
Well, I would say this. First of all, you know what you can do. But second of all, I would leave you with the story of Vishna, who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice. 
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. 
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. 
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience, this one child, you know, that story. 
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. 
So this is clearly bad news for Reuther. 
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. 
Because when you need it again, the meeting is literally hanging in your closet. 
It is technology that has made them different, and as we see what this technology can do, we need to recognize you can't kill the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it. 
Before the wolves turned up, they'd been absent for 70 years. 
And unfortunately when I first received the answers -- and here you'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed. 
I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work. 
For this so-called "battle," 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. 
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else, has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. 
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented; architects stopped using fractions, and they had a new model of nature. 
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. 
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico. 
So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. 
Thank you very much. 
CA: Janine, thank you so much. 
So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity, I had this idea. 
This is Bjorn Sundin. 
It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. 
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed, to examine what was safe and what wasn't. 
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done. 
Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. 
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces. 
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher. 
In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football, they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl. 
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be, for which I needed something. 
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -- when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood? 
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way. 
You've got maybe 10 seconds -- between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is -- to get their attention. 
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know, and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible. 
So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone? 
So as you go further away from the Sun, this becomes more and more powerful. 
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Many cried. 
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate. 
But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here, and that's the problem of collision. 
Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes. 
The U.S. Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen. 
Whatever we call it, it's new, it's beginning, and I think it's gong to quite significant. 
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. 
Thank you. 
Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this, but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it. 
But there are companies. 
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy. 
He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids, and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. 
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there. 
So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation. 
And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive. 
What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing, and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be, and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound. 
And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. 
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't. 
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher) So there was several of these. 
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg. 
First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house. 
(Applause) People talk loudly and slowly to me. 
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T. 
E: So you too must stand trial then. 
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle. 
But an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are, the less heart disease they have, the less cancer. 
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth. 
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained. 
It doesn't have air conditioning. 
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys: All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. 
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed: this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol, or keeping tabs, if you will. 
This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year, not to mention the impact on all of us: stress, inconvenience, missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. 
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator. 
But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. 
At the end of three years, I went back to New Haven, had remarried by that time. 
With kids, it's heaven." 
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar." 
This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture, just like music for humans would be. 
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses. 
In the background, my bicycle. 
And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude." 
But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come." 
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming, excessive new access to pornography. 
What I mean by that is, if the world superpower today was a communist, it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism, than it is today with the world superpower being America, occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. 
Pretty simple -- it's huge business. 
Push it and it becomes house shaped. 
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy. 
We started talking about slavery, and really, I started learning about slavery, for I had certainly known it existed in the world, but not to such a degree. 
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle. 
(Laughter) All right. I think I’m going to take these off now, because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK. 
(Applause) I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877, with a mathematician named Georg Cantor. 
There are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine. 
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy. 
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister. 
Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens. 
Add 64, we get 104. 
The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist, we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions. 
And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. 
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this, and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. 
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds. 
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible. 
And when they're transmitted through the water, unlike the first two modes of transmission, these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. 
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. 
So this animal is going to live twice as long. 
Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984 in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter. 
(Applause) That chicken wing changed my life. 
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. 
These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake, while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. 
And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. 
What that was was a bird feeder. 
(Laughter) Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat. 
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition. 
We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers. 
And we know that there are more. 
Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. 
The headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends. 
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted. 
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it." 
And she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world." 
So Procter &amp; Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that. 
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature, and we've done so, and look at that. 
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets, as is so often the case, they bring theater troupes, songs, music, dance. 
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years? 
Now is that all -- intention, effect? 
TG: Well, first of all, you've got to look at age. 
This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world, and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant. 
Thank you. 
Well, we certainly try. 
There is recovery. 
And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better." 
They have to, in fact, make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero, otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take. Sometime we need friends, family members or a psychiatrist. 
As is a capacity to discriminate systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery. 
(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
So we've got these challenges, and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance, make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions. 
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying that equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter) Go figure. 
And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots. 
(Applause) I call myself a body architect. 
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. 
I'd like to start with a little experiment. 
What, what, what, what about, what? 
And also, when traveling within Africa, you've got different settings for different mobile providers. 
And I realized that this wasn't just my life. 
Now in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult. 
(Laughter) So, they really are pretty amazing creatures. 
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together, and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition. 
Now, Brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession, but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations. 
It's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block. 
While setting up this shot, people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch. 
And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways, they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. 
All these forces came together there, in Princeton. 
They ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?" 
Ann Cooper's right. 
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works. 
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."

You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world, but the audience is too small, and the amount of research, the time it takes, the FDA clearances, the payback time is too long for V.C. to be interested. 
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started. 
A project called TEEB was started in 2007, and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8+5.

Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies, but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell, who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day. 
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. 
(Laughter) "Don't use big words." 
(Applause) I study how the brain processes information. That is, how it takes information in from the outside world, and converts it into patterns of electrical activity, and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see, hear, to reach for an object. 
But don't take my word for it. 
We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it. 
But we know how to fix this. 
And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness, as opposed to looking at it from the outside, fear subsides. 
So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one, then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one. 
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. 
So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends, and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves. 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. 
The rest of the scientific community said, "Great idea, Higgsy. 
And at the end of the four days, your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited, and it's because all these different bits have been put together. 
Now, moneyball, as many of you know, is what the Oakland A's did, where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games, and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience, the scouts' instincts and experience, to pick players, from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games. 
When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily -- things like grades, SAT's, degrees, the number of years in schooling. 
Well, technology to the rescue. 
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. 
Aging: The problem is enormous, 300,000 broken hips per year; but the solutions are extraordinary, and they include so many different things.

I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary. 
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. 
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. 
And this object knows, better than you and probably before you, what you really need. 
It's technology. 
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook.

There are 12 million blind children in our country -- (Applause) who live in a world of darkness. 
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. 
All the palm oil going there is good.

You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings. 
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. 
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.

Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. 
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. 
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler at the Mass. General in 1847, a whole new era of surgery was ushered in. 
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.

It's not enough to create one. 
It's just like this one, completely worthless, in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic magnetic ion attraction," which translates to "pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good, but it does absolutely nothing. 
Right? 
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.

From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates, and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's, so too are the vocal organs. 
This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. 
You know we teach our kids and we buy them games, but why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids, that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs? 
But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap. 
Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically, cognitively and behaviorally all the time. 
Now on to the detection algorithms. 
Global change, beautification rack culture, overfishing and unsustainable tourism, all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. 
So it's a totally different picture. 
All that savage grandeur, the steely glinting hooves, the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards, breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared, I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him. 
What would these unseen forms look like? 
They will start flying. 
If innovation is less powerful, invents less great, wonderful things, then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. 
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. 
We give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it. 
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction. 
If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive, so that their voices are heard, so then things would improve. 
"What do you want to do in a village? 
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them. 
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. 
The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes, in the form of colors, and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. 
You say that you were born in paradise. 
(Laughter) Just be grateful Robert Reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass. 
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience. 
It's like nothing you've ever done. 
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. 
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing. 
But now we do something different in our house, so we have these jam sessions, and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church. 
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an ATM machine. 
Let's go somewhere else." 
It's a life in dignity. 
And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new-found hope for the future. 
Why were other people blocking it? 
We traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous glaciers in the world, the Beardmore glacier. 
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds? 
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures. 
It's just not going to happen. 
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. 
(Laughter) And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED, I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum. 
If you're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them, I put in a letter. 
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.

Thank you. 
How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create, on all the circumstances we create, on all the places we change?

You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? 
The English language is as big as it is. 
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. 
We need to take advantage of that. 
In fact, you're building a long-term liability by inflating civil service. 
(Applause) I am going to talk about myself, which I rarely do, because I -- well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about. 
Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other. 
Today, there are very few things that money can't buy. 
We never got the chance to say goodbye. 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that. 
And here's where those guns come in. 
If you hold your hand out in front of you, you can't see it. 
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid. 
The great University of California university system, the great things that have gone on, won't happen. 
But all the while that we've been working on this engagement for Cleveland, we've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date, and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. 
And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well. 
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. 
(Applause) The 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. 
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter) You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter) Audio jack, power supply -- and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right? 
And I have a collection, probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. 
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge. 
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.

If that was the age of the universe, then this is the age of life on Earth. 
If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here, you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter) That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. 
When you go into spaces like this, you're directly accessing the past, because they sit untouched for decades. 
Not a complicated thing. 
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. 
MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough, it was the last time we were in Vancouver, about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver, at the airport, on a trip that we were both taking to China, that I would actually, from my background, I would call it a boondoggle. 
We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. 
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more. 
PCBs accumulate. 
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear. 
When they play economic games with human beings, they'll spontaneously make fair offers, even when they're not required to do so. 
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. 
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter) So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore. 
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. 
You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text. 
This is one of my favorites. 
It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window, the threshold, the bed -- such prosaic objects. And yet, I try, in every building, to take that virtual world, which is so enigmatic and so rich, and create something in the real world. 
It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States. 
The Leuna chemical plant, after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war, was up and running within weeks. 
And we were doing open-heart surgery. 
And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere ... 
Like me, they are dreaming big. 
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. 
If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away, then they will show off with each other about what they can do. 
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers. 
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium. 
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day. 
This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are. 
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. 
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website. 
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology, but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us, figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world. 
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand, making mountains and seas -- well, not seas, but different things -- people and dogs, etc. 
And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that, you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health. 
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them." 
So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization, or a new fund within the FEED Foundation, called the 30 Project. 
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. 
And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data, and once it's there, you can do cool stuff like this. 
That's an actual quality of the trickster. 
That's the beauty of this economy. 
That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. 
We're just driving so much more; we haven't been able to keep up technologically. 
But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods, and the way she went about things, and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly. 
(Applause) There was criticism too because they said, "Players are being bought and sold? 
But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work. 
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time. 
Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. 
Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future. 
People swore they were eating barbecue sauce, and this is free food. 
And the last piece, which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many, this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems. 
So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer, and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?" 
He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver. 
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability. 
It's particularly important -- this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired -- it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. 
But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse. 
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive. 
And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same and I later asked her why, she told me that, best she could tell, her tears had had something to do with my being happy and strong, but vulnerable too. 
I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. 
DP: "Tiger Rag." 
Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange. 
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right. 
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. 
You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload. 
I know how to do it, and my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest. 
Well, it's a matter of arithmetic. 
So, we are now able to read genomes. 
Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars, and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there. 
1917. This is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate, or something like that. 
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge, very exciting. 
The Chinese naval contingent. 
Antarctica was, for the most part, a century ago, uncharted. 
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 
The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now. 
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.

Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. 
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now, just to give you a taste of it. 
So they tracked their own private currency, and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted -- all organized by the players themselves. 
Amid its crowds, he felt immense gratitude, but also duty. 
But he's not happy; something's wrong. 
So what about us? What about our generation, and our media revolution, the Internet? 
And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means. 
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. 
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. 
(Laughter) Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good. 
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets, and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free." 
And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today." 
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems, and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system, cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time. 
So peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth. 
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line, they said, "We are changing this bargain as of right now. 
Now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made. 
Why is that? 
He knew all about that kind of science. 
If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe. 
We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. 
So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years. 
Can you say it? A-rhythm-etic. Audience: A-rhythm-etic. 
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. 
I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. 
We're taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey. 
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east, but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year. 
Notice that we don't do this in science. 
E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars. 
So, we decided to make things that would look like that. 
The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including Germany. 
It's also a massive saving of resources. 
From an engineering point of view, this is just a little four-bar linkage. 
19 percent of the world's population today, Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth. 
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. 
It's built on gold. 
Goodbye, my love, goodbye." 
Is it something that we survive? 
Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you, because it is all about changing perceptions, and, indeed, building a new level of trust. 
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations. 
Discoveries like fire happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view, the world never improved. 
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. 
So for each person we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram. 
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that. 
But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away. 
Now I was getting a little anxious. 
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. 
So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe? 
What happened to our bread in the meantime? 
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. 
You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this? 
It's really a very interesting -- you ever see "The Abyss" where Ed Harris, you know, he's sinking down along the side of the wall? 
And that's exactly what we were aiming for. 
Thank you. Namaste. 
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work." 
I put the question -- three or four weeks ago, we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in Norway. 
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people's thoughts and emotions. 
He's well educated, he's smart, he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn. 
At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement, and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. 
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. 
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job. 
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate, it wants to send a message to the red neuron, it spits out neurotransmitter. 
(Laughter) Humor does need a target. 
Because ultimately, the question before us, and the question before seven billion people on the planet is, how can we create prosperity? 
These are entanglement scars. 
Now, at this point, you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. 
Our streets were really wide, and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across, and you had to run in order to get there in time. 
EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact, the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me. 
The problem is he doesn't exist. 
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. 
And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance. 
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it. 
AV: We, or I? 
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long. 
She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus. 
We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city. 
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here. 
It was not a main driver of behavior, nor was it a main driver of behavior change. 
This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. 
There's something else about them that you see -- they don't see themselves. 
Think about your own choices. 
So never mind; you're fine just being yourself. 
If you just had paper or plastic -- obviously reusable is far more beneficial -- then the paper is worse, and the paper is worse because it weighs four to 10 times more than the plastic, and when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective, a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper, the paper is far better, but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material. 
Both are viable; both take off. 
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience. 
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did. 
But what are you doing? 
I learned that manual labor really sucks. 
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level; they had no need to touch her breasts. 
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. 
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? 
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. 
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff. 
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us. 
And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice, so that macroscopically it looks the same. 
I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world. 
After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow. 
They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy." 
I think if you treat people well, people will come back and come back for more. 
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here." 
It doesn't taste very good either. 
So for instance, several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. 
I remember, I decided to write my "Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai, and the interviewer's first question to me was, "Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe that the world is round?" And I started laughing, because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter) And as I was laughing, I was thinking, I really need a more coherent response, especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter) But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question. 
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy. 
In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead. 
We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher. 
At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador, and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. 
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents, the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich. 
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality. 
Now, I've talked about the patient as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract outside this room. 
Just open it. 
All right. 
My name is Jonathan Zittrain, and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist. 
I want to know your product, and that's very important. 
And we'll call this a wheel. 
LL: Right. Bingo. Point. 
We take less notice of trivial matters. 
He gives half of them vitamin B12. 
It's very simple, because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. 
And at the end of my freshman year of college, I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. 
And before we have the debate, I'd like to actually take a show of hands -- on balance, right now, are you for or against this? 
They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed. 
And my favorite example is always fingers. 
And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids. 
My office folds away, easily hidden. 
This is what you find: rock carvings which indigenous peoples, uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe. 
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you. 
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare. 
Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long. 
It was nice. 
But then it comes to your operations. 
So at dinner that night, our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head, and say, "You know, Deb, now you're really going to learn what's important. 
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials. 
So when I click on "sympathetic magic," I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls. 
If you generalize this, the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with, both easily and deeply, such as happiness, our own body, food, emotions. 
(Laughter) And in that way we traded lore with each other. 
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create. 
In fact, it goes against natural survival. 
Thank you. (Applause) One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. 
Now notice, I'm not talking about government. 
But it's a famous picture, not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings, but actually because of a tiny, faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. 
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. 
He finally faced the hatred that had defined his life. 
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example. 
And I've just chosen a few of them here. 
In spite of that, people have to live, have to eat this food in order to survive. 
Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. 
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. 
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember, or at least visually, was a foraging behavior. 
But that's fascinating, right? 
The first one is a lack of bilinguals. 
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business, has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace. 
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate. 
There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. 
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. 
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well, we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. 
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever. 
This is the case. There are no other cases." 
Very disappointing results. 
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7. 
First you need access to land. 
The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing. 
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression. 
Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. 
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble. 
It's almost self-funding. 
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers, we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. 
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks. 
And all of a sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped, and you stared. It was creepy." (Laughter) This girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about. (Laughter) "And then you looked at the guy next to me, and you smiled, and you reached in your bucket, and you pulled out a lollipop, and you held it out to him, and you said, 'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you.'" And she said, "I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life. 
It's something called the reward schedule. 
Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety. 
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro, said I had the job teaching gifted children. 
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on. 
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit, but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the Creative Commons, which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry. 
Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. 
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. 
Now take it to the last step. 
He was only three at the time. 
And let me show you what's behind it. 
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp, that you really feel you're in control of the cutting. 
All right, if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true, any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity. 
And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this. 
The problem was just that in the material, mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it. 
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. 
And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. 
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south. 
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas. 
Since 1995: less than one percent per annum. 
Because for them it's not a surgery test, it's an English test. 
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space. 
And that was the mission that we came up with. 
(Applause) So, a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist: I had a baby. 
There's a term called metafiction, and that's just stories about stories, and meta's having a moment now. 
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place. 
Well, let me finish. 
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece. 
(Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing. 
The results were quite extraordinary. 
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that. 
That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. 
The universe is really big. 
The first thing we actually shared with them was this. 
And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time. 
he's busy as can be; ♫ ♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫ ♫ Out of an old settee. ♫ ♫ He'll carry me off, I know that he will, ♫ ♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫ ♫ And the only thing that occurs to me ♫ ♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫ ♫ And on the day that we sail, I will leave a little note ♫ ♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫ ♫ "I have flown to an island in the bay ♫ ♫ With my janitor's red haired-boy." ♫ 
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent. 
That's why, two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. 
And the nurses told me two things. 
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge. 
It felt wrong to do that in some way. 
That process is called a synapse. 
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts. 
It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives. 
I sometimes push too hard. 
For so many years we have fed on aid. 
And our ancestors lived in that game park, but were just the minorities. They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are. 
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand. 
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's. 
(Laughter) You know, it's just ludicrous. 
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful. 
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone, so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. 
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. 
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing. 
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. 
And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty. 
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. 
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. 
There's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do. 
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream. 
If it's a tail -- well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away and put the champagne back. 
But in the second session, they admitted already that they would never do this, what they are doing in these other countries, here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on. 
You know. What about safety? 
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it? 
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay? 
In the New England Journal of Medicine, there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming, people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. 
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides. 
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. 
On behalf of Hal and myself, I wish all the best to your present and future selves. 
(Laughter) RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle. 
A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. 
You look at them in September, they've gone down. 
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other. 
And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do, for example, what you're seeing right now. 
This is what dictionaries used to look like. 
So, very unexpectedly, they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales. 
Absolutely vital. 
Now, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom. 
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century. 
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil. 
This is part of DEPTHX's mission. 
And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England. 
Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. 
Most importantly, these cylinders and this snow trap air. 
We are the old machines. 
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking. 
This is fantastic." And he said to me, "Well, do you have money?" And I said, "No." And he said, "That's okay, we can still figure it out." 
And this is quite an extraordinary idea, but it is reality today. 
And, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form. 
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big. 
What's the kind of technique? 
So every 10 years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have. 
Perflourooctanoic acid. 
Because of their pimped carroças, they are able to fight back to prejudice, increase their income and their interaction with society. 
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse, but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper, say it is scientifically sound -- that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine, it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse. 
We know the obstacles that are in our way right now, in difficult times. 
This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. 
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness. 
The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. 
Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep, but also tells others you're awake. 
Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest." 
It's creating electrical patterns. 
But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes. 
They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing, no talking to yourselves, no farting. 
Likewise for hearing. 
So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia? 
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while. 
(Laughter) That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s. 
And then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture, on the elements that make up the broader scheme, the buildings themselves, and start guiding us. 
It's a satellite which was all made of ice, and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice. 
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning. 
We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model. 
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state. 
We, as I've said, have got to hit that market, but we've got to use our heads rather than our might. 
This hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now. 
First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. 
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building. 
He has to keep his job. 
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more. 
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this, and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity. 
I want fewer quests where my son is told, "Go out and fight it alone," and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people become better and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz. 
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s, if you were pregnant and you were single, you were seen as a threat to the community. 
This is a chicken with teeth. 
However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies. 
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. 
In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves. 
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity. 
Run for your heterosexual lives, people. 
And he'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change. 
These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. 
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training, it gives people motivation. 
It's not my EEG at Cedars; it's your EEG tonight and last night. 
That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent. 
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police, like in this classic scene from "The Godfather." 
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov, sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair, leafing through a book and butterflies, imagine such displacement, such loss?" 
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. 
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us. 
So The 99 work in teams of three. 
And the last is that these bold, new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans, and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet, for what it's worth. 
And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. 
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent. 
Transparency can be misdirected. 
(Laughter) And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible, what this love of country says back is, "That's just irrelevant." 
We just want to try and create that awareness because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world, but that attitude, that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug, that is what could change the world. 
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones, complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die. 
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety. 
And they started settling out. 
In 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?" 
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull, I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station, to the route of the train. 
Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example. 
And let's look at another map. 
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US. 
(Laughter) Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here. 
Peres thought that was a great idea. 
Where you're not doing. It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun, and when it died out from under me, that was one of the most liberating things because I could create. 
And the question is: What underlies this transformation? 
And my mother was a kind of a designer, also. 
Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict? 
It turns out to be very important. 
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols, like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage, and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others. 
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English, and I stuck it up for my friends to use. 
He comes for a tummy rub, because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter) When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. 
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike, or their strike force, and something about the time period in the molting cycle. 
(Laughter) So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity, and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants. 
Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave. 
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today. 
Scott and his final team of five arrived at the South Pole in January 1912 to find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen, who rode on dogsled. 
And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful. 
They take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka. 
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better? 
(Laughter) So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted. 
The spiral thread we call a "solo hot spot." 
This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design. 
Wangari said once, "In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground." 
So the patients are not organ systems, and they're not diseases; they're people, people with lives. 
And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action, which is kind of a political question, a policy question about race, if you will -- not much difference here. 
It has the improving fundamentals. 
Same with furniture, it's too utilitarian. 
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab, you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right? Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up. 
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it. 
(Applause) Wow, wow, OK, stop. 
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria. 
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. 
I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah." 
I make them stand at attention like a soldier. 
So in that case, I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away, or strip, those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. 
And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing. 
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole. 
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. 
And we're miserable. (Laughter) And we're miserable not because the other guy can't run a good meeting, it's because of MAS, our Mindless Accept Syndrome, which is a self-inflicted wound. 
What a waste of a life." 
(Laughter) (Applause) The children enthusiastically got after me and said, "Now, what do you want us to do?" 
Now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries. 
How do you do that? 
Another night it was Tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing, and that in fact, explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night. 
These are when. 
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets, will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it. 
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. 
My hair wasn't right. 
It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way, totally voluntary-led, we have turned that into a market garden training center, and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future. 
It's an amazing notion. 
And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan, of all the fuel energy you feed into the car, seven-eighths never gets to the wheels; it's lost first in the engine, idling at zero miles a gallon, the power train and accessories. 
Convincing people to do something -- take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be -- is not an act of information: "Let's give them the data, and when they have data they'll do the right thing." 
And in between, there should be a public agency, the Independent Service Authority, which channels public money, and especially donor money, to the retail providers. 
We will never again have just three television networks, all of which are relatively centrist. 
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back, and she told me a story. 
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them. 
And I am as bad as you. 
And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter. 
In the time remaining, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. 
I don't know who the players are. 
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion. 
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it. 
So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. 
So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on, and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. 
Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies. 
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics. 
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction. 
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. 
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. 
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes, the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng. 
And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work, from films to buildings, from games to graphics. 
Autocratic -- do what I say because I'm the chef. 
It's bushfelt region, which is dry and prone to a lot of fires, as so what these trees have done is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree, and that this is ground level, imagine that the whole thing, that whole bulk of the tree, migrated underground, and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. 
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future. 
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO2. 
(Laughter) Every 10 years they reproduce the same study. 
The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside. 
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it. 
Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed. 
It was the first DNA phage, DNA virus, DNA genome that was actually sequenced. 
I was on a high. 
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. 
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. 
Education: how do we improve education? 
The natural thing to do after you've done that -- and that's what this project, the International HapMap Project, which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries. 
Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. 
Proximity is amazing. 
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C. 
So if you combine the two studies together, then the question becomes, can you start from a face and, using facial recognition, find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person, and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information, much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face? 
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here. 
It's called "Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know, if you check, if you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right? 
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. 
So I emailed him back and I said, "Please share with me an image, something, that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending." 
But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition. 
So, visualizing information, so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense, or it tells a story, or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. 
When you're sighted, everybody kind of sticks to themselves, you mind your own business. 
Our first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage, a virus that attacks only E. coli. 
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit. 
Yeah! Yeah. 
We're going to make lots of errors. 
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343. 
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school, and I think, for some reason, this has been incorporated in Google. 
The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important, and so naturally, people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. 
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment. 
Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven? 
That every person here, every decision that you've made today, every decision you've made in your life, you've not really made that decision, but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions is made, each one going off into a new universe. 
I thought that was it. 
It never works. 
One day a man told me, "My future does not look brilliant, but I want to have a brilliant future for my son." 
These days, I call myself a graphic artist. 
Of course, my job is all about listening, and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen. 
And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling. 
And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know? And if technology is not a metaphor for memory, what is it? 
One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other. 
(Laughter) We have all these lessons in front of us, but we don't take those opportunities; we teach kids to go get a tutor. 
And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time. 
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale, because I know that sounds like a big number, but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. 
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself. 
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens. 
That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. 
Now that is -- my take on that ... 
She's some other woman. She's an impostor." 
Everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction. 
It's also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia. 
We've been here before with energy, and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch, because the cheapest energy was slavery. 
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked. 
Now if you think about it, in the age before GPS and radar, that was obviously a really difficult problem. 
But actually, aren't most of us not really so very good at empathy? 
From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture. 
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. 
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off. 
(Applause) This is a world-changing invention. 
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood, and be understood by the brain. 
And what I discovered is, because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film, there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things. 
Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES, started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures. 
So what is the daf-2 gene? 
1980: The longest running court case in U.S. history, the Sioux Nation v. the United States, was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character? 
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want. 
In the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective, and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. 
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art? 
So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. 
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. 
You would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that? 
And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science. 
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them. 
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work. 
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. 
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener. 
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here -- I'm not saying the men are not important -- obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do? 
And in these donor meetings, I noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients, by the governments, by promoters, many of them representing suppliers from the North -- that the worst projects were realized first. 
We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years. 
And the discussion is, who cares? Right? 
Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. 
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened. 
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field. 
Okay. 
Now we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki. 
The health argument is a scary one, and you've probably heard part of this argument before. 
Now at this point we're leaving the water, and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level, the player is designing their creature, and that's a fundamental aspect of this. 
And I just want to thank everybody for coming. 
You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really, you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say, "You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy," and they're going to hoot you off the stage. 
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide mutually dependent circles, rather than isolating triangles. 
It's almost machine-like the way people are born and people die, and the stories keep coming and coming. 
We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted -- like this, "The Exile of the Leper." 
Now, lets take some data. Facebook. 
He said you needed addition and subtraction. 
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. 
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we? 
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works. 
And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie, and I said, "It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight." 
Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work. 
How about underground with a view? 
I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years, and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. 
And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister. 
(Applause) This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science. 
And we did. 
And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit. 
Another child within weeks of Tasering the six year-old boy. 
So let me back up a little bit. 
(Laughter) "And furthermore, it is the thought that counts." 
So we got in touch with him. 
But the question is, does forgiveness and redemption replace justice? 
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge, and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony held at Harvard University, and this ceremony is a very nice experience. 
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed. 
And I went down and they rolled him into a room. 
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him. 
CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. 
And then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life. 
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution. 
And it doesn't feel good at all. 
And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October 7, 2014. 
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever." 
Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures, we can then use the patient's own cells, or some cell population, and the biomaterials, the scaffolds, together. 
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past. 
I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, as you can see by the look on my face, reluctantly so, but with good reason, because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the sarcophagus, which is the covering over reactor number four, which was hastily built 27 years ago, now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation. 
No big deal. 
So why is it so important? 
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities. 
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. 
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network. 
Everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here. 
And that happens to be quite easy. 
Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils, had a humility, of course, and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him. 
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards. 
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. 
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands. 
And I threw away my rake. 
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. 
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. 
And they went through that process. 
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. 
Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question. 
Our health care systems are broken. 
We have downgraded this factor. 
And it's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability. 
And we have a cool atmosphere. 
Let me just show a map of Rio again. 
We pass it down from generation to generation. 
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. 
Being a leader gives you charisma. 
That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual, but leads to real change. 
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his [unclear]. 
Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year, and vertically, you see the document that served the reconstruction, paintings, for instance. 
It's just actually -- you see, this is folding up -- it's behind the seat. 
And then I get asked questions. 
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture. 
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products. 
So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster. 
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. 
And rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language. 
And I started getting in further and further into the factories. 
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. 
Which, incidentally, is only a third correct. 
And it is a crisis in health care systems. 
What does this mean? 
She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had. 
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations. 
And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV, or at best, microfinance. 
This is a bowhead whale. 
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. 
Now there's often no right or wrong here. 
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience, but I have to. 
If you look like that, you look to the past, or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself. 
So anyone can plug him -- (Applause) -- thank you. 
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. 
Toby Ord is very concerned about this, and he's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others, so it's very important to find the effective ones. 
The other thing to do is to knock the product, attack the brand myth, as we've said. 
Is it because it's a soft option; we have nothing else to do? 
Democracy is not an overnight achievement; it's a process. 
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum. 
That's it. Image removed at request of owner. 
As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration. 
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. 
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. 
And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young named Kamal right here, the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around. 
You should just nudge them in the right direction. 
If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go, "I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you, I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that. 
Even of Salinas. 
And on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming. 
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into. 
They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs, and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I've been there for four years. Love it. 
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it. 
They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources. 
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year, and as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet. 
The little boy next to her watched this happen, then turned to his box and and burst into tears without even touching it. 
Fears also have suspense. 
I was awakened once during the night. 
Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we know they've had a concussion. 
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. 
And I felt badly for not having done a good job. 
But there's a nonprofit behind it, and kids go through a door that says "Employees Only" and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read. 
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. 
Let's go to schools. 
They said that "we want freedom; we want democracy. 
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns. 
Unlike the sun, human beings think. 
And you get a far lower risk of famine, because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one. 
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe. 
So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face? 
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations, each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share, creating a broader concept of the environment. 
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.) -- and I was there with a catcher's mitt. 
I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR, but Watson won handily. 
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books -- "Spiderman" and "X-Men." 
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before. 
Well, I don't know if you know about this, but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch, and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil, and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season, it allows us to control weeds, and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient. 
They arrive first. 
Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses of San Bruno, California, are on the roof. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious. 
EC: Right, right. 
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. 
And for me, as a service provider, I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything. 
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. 
They taught him music -- scales, in fact. 
She wanted to change policy at the government level. 
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff. 
Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both. 
Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you." 
CP: At first, very kind of pained, awkward conversations. 
When you meet them, they lock into you, they look you in the eye, they invade your personal space, they massage the back of your head. 
Your fear should be that you are not, that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal. 
And, of course, by that time, you know how I dress -- I dress from head to toe in a black hijab. 
You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera, and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. 
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right? 
RNG: That sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason. 
But the cost has to be brought right down. 
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal. 
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies -- this building was part of that series of complexes, what they called the Twin Towers. 
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose, but I don't know where to start. 
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. 
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds, and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today. 
Then there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war. 
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. 
He turned it into an adventure for the kids. 
(Laughter) If so, I haven't yet spotted it. 
I study false memories. 
And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia, and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. 
This is very, very low. 
Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N. 
This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K. 
I started in 2005 studying honeybees. 
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning. 
So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint. 
They have been forced off their lands. 
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that." 
Right there, above, way above the solar system, way beyond our solar system. 
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics, I just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients." 
What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period, in this case it was eight months, and literally to the day the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use. 
Well, I knew I did, so I picked up the magazine and I began to look, and we weren't on it. 
Telling me you're going to be out there making a billion dollars a year -- that's not believable. 
We've got increasing market stalls selling local food, and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing. 
Meditate for half an hour. 
(Laughter) I mean, look at those graphics there. 
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. 
There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests. 
As Riadh Guerfali, the veteran digital activist from Tunisia, remarked over this incident, "Before, things were simple: you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other. 
Because of our metabolism, we as human beings, we produce heat. 
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to." 
So this really matters. 
So, various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. 
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them, it's really confusing. 
And eventually, they get permission -- this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description. 
One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called "rapture of the deep." 
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. 
While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. 
I was detained on the 27th night. 
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient. 
These examples indicate a trend. 
Thank you. 
Why else would she release these penguins at me? 
Now we talk about food deserts, places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. 
Limburg, be proud of your cheese, as it is now used in the fight against malaria. 
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years. 
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. 
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. 
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?" 
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school. 
I venture there are many in this room. 
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff. 
Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies. 
It took as long as the Taj Mahal. 
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world, but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. 
I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid. 
I wanted to understand who takes the job. 
Thank you. 
But the opposite happened. 
Audience: No. 
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. 
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one, and I said, "Skin color."

And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit, is really transforming the relationship, or the interplay, between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. 
So now what do I do? 
(Laughter) All right, well thanks for coming up. 
But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship? 
And as you all know, boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder -- and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. 
And they actually did get a fine for that. 
Years after that, he was teaching the racquetball teachers. 
But let's also think, as a visual species, what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater. 
Why April? 
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face," and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses, it knows that what was out there was a baby's face, and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was, say, a dog, or another pattern would be a house. 
It's just a euphemism for killing, right? 
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis, and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors. 
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives. 
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites -- and almost anything you pick up is like that. 
And then I said, "Goodbye." 
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. 
I call this hypersonic sound. 
And so she thought, well, what the heck. 
I have to trust the orchestra, and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself. 
So first, one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center. 
They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric." 
That is something that we should embrace -- a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa. 
They're going to be small. 
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine. 
Trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others. 
We already know how to kill malaria, but some people come to you and say, "You have your millions. How about bed nets?" 
And he said, "It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life." 
It's about the size of Lake Ontario. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And they look at my face, and they said, "You are teaching girls here." 
(Text: This insult to father's stones?) (Laughter) And then comes the ending, which is my favorite part of the whole thing. 
And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor. 
But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player. 
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee, which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig, who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc. 
The mothers aren't quite convinced. 
We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. 
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. 
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years. 
And we might want to look at these various images. 
Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. 
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials, we should know and understand them. 
The punch line is that a year and a half later, I was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter, got married. 
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. -- they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed, transported, housed and so on. And the information technology, which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity? 
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter) I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration. 
What we need is a players' uprising. 
First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live, and they're going to underpin that with a license. 
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? 
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. 
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. 
The exact converse is also true. 
This seemed practical now, because a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years since I had last looked at it. 
(Applause) June Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight. 
Beautiful, because it has symmetry. 
So that was the 20th century. 
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on, that is actually us? 
AIDS, incredibly, has just been named, in the past month, a chronic disease, meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years, as we said only a decade ago, but is thought to live decades, probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether. 
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic. 
This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. 
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions. 
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. 
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act. 
The high speed was 16 kilocycles. 
Now I happen to know my children don't lie, so I thought, as a neuroscientist, it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths. 
There is one case that we have begun to understand better, and it's the case of fireflies. 
Often they travel on pre-published routes. 
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. 
Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light. 
But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here? 
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. 
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment. 
The drama here is, in fact, that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one, if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development. 
I don't know what to do. 
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. 
And when you go to the pristine side, did this ever bleach? 
I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else. 
What this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve, but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time. 
She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders, even if she does not like them. 
So in a way, if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth, endless use of material resources, it's like if this man was saying -- and I heard a former head of state, I won't mention who, saying -- "Five years ago, we were at the edge of the precipice. 
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth. 
Number one group on Meetup right now, most chapters in most cities with most members, most active? 
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil. 
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine. 
They went out and where Shriram lives, they vaccinated two million people. 
So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects. 
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. 
This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter, but that it's one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage. 
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone. 
But private communities, private, corporate, privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies. 
However, if we parents are unaware, we are leaving our children to fend for themselves. 
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it. 
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart, they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic, and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear. 
So this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler. 
The first day they all came back. 
There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. 
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded. 
You feel good when you do something right, you feel bad when you do something wrong. 
So it's everywhere in a day there is light. 
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. 
In chapter seven, I focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline. 
All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue, because down in there is what is called ancient DNA. 
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. 
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost. 
We have problems. 
Light came out of it in every direction. 
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved. 
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard. 
So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't, Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat, covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them, while I kill the goat. 
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. 
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend, but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. 
Well, that's today, but we don't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like. 
What about contributions we can't even predict? 
So when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009, that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results. 
Next is Roy Penig, a really interesting Kentucky artist, and he's the nicest guy. 
It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people. 
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera. 
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. 
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate, many, many times. 
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table. 
I want to add a third element. I want to add model. 
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. 
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called. 
To understand what that means, let's look at the lecture-based classroom, and let's pick the median performance as a threshold. 
The intuitive but obvious thing is that somehow intelligence is defined by behavior, that we are intelligent because of the way that we do things and the way we behave intelligently, and I'm going to tell you that's wrong. 
And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further. 
It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine. 
(Applause) So I have bad news, I have good news, and I have a task. 
But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student. 
Simple information processing, simple consciousness. 
Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter) No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you. 
CA: And when do you think that will happen? 
This book's title's subtitle is: "Access to Tools." 
So they figured not being able to see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk. 
It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. 
I use the euphemism digestive comfort -- actually -- it's a digestive discomfort, which the gut is concerned with. 
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor. 
Yeah, there you go. 
Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding. 
They had good relationships with the teachers, students. 
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this. 
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness. 
There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey. 
We are They Might Be Giants. 
Well, I think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget. 
I do not remember what time it was. 
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers, there's a capacitor attached to it too. 
We're right at that point of transition. 
Design nowadays, if you mean it, you don't start with styling sketches. 
that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other. 
So, that's really the goal of my talk, is to A, communicate that moment to you and B, have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered. 
She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. 
But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology. 
(Applause) I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. 
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board. 
(Laughter) I think, how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in 18 minutes? 
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. 
So this is already evidence of how, in the academic literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted. 
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. 
I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff. 
And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France -- and here’s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression -- and one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin." 
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. 
And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format. 
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago. 
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. 
We put the beeper in the clinic. 
This is a photograph of the object. 
Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. 
I'll give you one of them. 
And the comedy comes along, dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest -- race, religion, politics, sexuality -- only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin, we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows, revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. 
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist. 
And if I wanted to paint on people, well, I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. 
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. 
It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost. 
This keeps happening. 
We like to dance together, we like singing together. 
TS: It is the paint actually, makes it real. 
And then she says, "Not one of our girls." 
You change that system, and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. 
When you pick up a piece of history like that, I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science. 
You can see the skydiver with the red suit, he's in a stand-up position. 
He did not believe they existed in nature. 
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. 
I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open. 
So that's been what we've seen in Cayman, it's been what we've seen in Brazil in those trials. 
So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now, and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning, not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. 
And that makes a happy family. 
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful. 
They didn't get very far, obviously. 
So that's the basic concept that we use. 
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out, just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students, and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well, fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know that if I did a study where I found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers, it probably wouldn't get published in a journal. 
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. 
I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph, and then I heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it. 
The first thing is, we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development. 
Elizabeth has realized, and she's coming face-to-face with her own sense of jealousy, her own sense of mortality. 
Thank you. 
So that's the conventional approach. 
We don't know what those laws are yet, but that's what we're after. 
And I pose this question. 
This was my moment to lean in, to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs, and I had just finished a big, 18-month project for Secretary Clinton, successfully, and I knew I could handle a bigger job. 
As an industrial engineer, cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur. 
That means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity, and the arrows flow clearly from left to right. 
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion. 
Though, for a lot of people, the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. 
Now, the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future. 
And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. 
You're every step I make ... 
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. 
We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage, but beaches are closed a lot in our country. 
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford, really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them. 
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room -- totally lemonade stand style. 
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this, what we found is that 46 percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes. 
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator? 
But it started with some practical problems. 
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn, followed by a third of a turn, the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. 
Eventually, the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit, and this has become -- fortunately it's become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today. 
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift. 
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. 
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians make good software programmers and accountants, but they can't do the creative stuff." 
There is no surface fresh water. 
The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection, something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while. 
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan. 
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. 
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance, farther than we can hear. 
It didn't have that kind of collateral. 
He's looking for those genes as well. 
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers, which is encouraging. 
They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay. 
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure. 
Interagency physicians come out. 
But once he gets there, he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property. 
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. 
But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher. 
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical, maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have. 
(Laughter) And I made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do. 
Very hard to find something that, to everybody, is a very beautiful thing, without a certain amount of information packed in there before. 
Animals are not just raw materials. 
And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. 
(Laughter) What a handsome cat. 
RF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws. 
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state. 
We're facing very tough challenges. 
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large-body impact. 
Is it something about the details or the colors? 
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. 
Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we've become our own school. 
And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. 
ELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. 
Not at the last card. 
Half of that runs pumps and fans. 
So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian -- we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories, where you say, how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is, after we go through a lot of levels, including designing a huge, messy system with thousands of ports, we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. 
Hello, everyone. 
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. 
And because walking was one of the first things I lost, I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. 
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint. 
In person, fireflies are charming. 
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection. 
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging. 
At the same time, the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed. 
But people do because it's so cheap, and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted. 
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here, who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land. 
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals, changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. 
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. 
And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes. 
And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there, which is part of the reason why this whole species-mapping project is so important. 
Nor do I think we are by ourselves, actually going to solve the problem. 
She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening. 
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already. 
Now look at that. That's a real lung. 
Anticipation made them happy. 
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are, but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. 
But one reason is because it indicates a change, from before to after. 
This is not insignificant. 
It was a matter of, I wanted actually a break, and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs, we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things. 
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln. 
So now we're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration, it will accelerate outcomes. 
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent, and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even. 
If you look at the word "salvation" in the Bible -- the Christian usage that we're familiar with -- saving souls, that people go to heaven -- that's actually a latecomer. 
I develop and test models of the Big Bang, using observational data. 
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification. 
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. 
All open, all available. 
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?" 
When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west, it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. 
And the question which I want to ask is the following: How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before -- we have more rights, we can travel easier, we have access to more information -- at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed? 
You can really see the details of the data set. 
But then these same children deny each other their full attention. 
I said, "I'm designing newspapers." 
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. 
The gourd you see here is -- everything in their lives is symbolic. 
And he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar. 
And now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through? 
Protect your ears in that way. 
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ... 
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. 
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. 
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays, and being the spineless guy, I thought, well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. 
It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. 
(Laughter) OK. Now, we've heard, of course, that we're all soldiers here. 
Our research covered the biology of the system, which included studying the way algae grew, but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae. 
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in, they vaporize and they make these fountains, these microscopic fountains that go up into the -- I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air -- goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon, they have these beautiful colored glass spherules. 
So, while they became successful, I know how to make them, so I'm not a neophyte, and they're no longer serious -- they have become solemn. 
And climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads. 
Whose son shall it be? 
You've heard in the past several years, the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. 
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation. 
The only country in the world. 
It's the gold standard. 
Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work. 
And your motor command saying there is an arm, and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it, there is no phantom, there is no arm, right? 
The people of this part of India worship the king cobra. 
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. 
Industrial designers want to make novel things. 
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. 
It's the coolest stuff. 
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post-docs who have taught me so much, and I have had many of these groups come and go. 
We have to think about function as well, and when it comes to sex, function relates to the contributions made by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs. 
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen. 
And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas. 
Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer. 
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results. 
The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence. 
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms: either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action, or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war, disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion. 
And using these kinds of measures, and many others, what we found out is that our science could, in fact, identify this condition early on. 
Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. 
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. 
The question is, is there a positive social singularity? 
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay? 
You glaze over with it. 
Furthermore, people in the informal economy, the gray economy -- as time goes by, crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world, or they can join the legitimate world. 
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. 
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right, but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating. 
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. 
They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. 
In fact, if you've got good enough governance, there is no resource boom. 
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. 
So, are you ready for the lecture? 
It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books, which was the inspiration for this particular idea. 
Why do we feel that this is more true than this? 
Thank you so much. 
OK, that's fair enough. 
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place. 
And we can then create functional livers. 
The idea goes like this: imagine space is a substrate of all there is. 
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood, but it probably wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict what finding E.T.'s going to mean, we can't predict that either. 
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor. 
And so I get angry, and I get pissed, as do lots of average people. 
Now, as it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy, and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles. 
So in one of our experiments, we asked people to name a famous person who they adored, a living person they adored. 
It's not about selling soap, there is a larger purpose out there. 
If we are going to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago, knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today, what would we do? 
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. 
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect. 
(Music) (Applause) Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. 
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention. 
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus. 
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude. 
And it did happen this way. 
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. 
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. 
Don't you know that school is banned for girls? 
EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone. 
Customer: I'd like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39. 
And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. 
(Applause) So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet, don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit. 
Another objection: There's nothing really new here. 
We need to act like the future depends on it. 
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. 
So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. 
We'll do that." 
If we were doing it like they do it -- let's not do it, but if we were to do it -- I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture." 
Nobody wanted to work with us. 
Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. 
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. 
And when I started out, I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff. 
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever, we have plenty of natural gas. 
It included an exterior loading dock. 
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC. 
France says, "No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact." 
And if you took a drop of that water, you might find a million diarrheal organisms. 
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money, but you're going to get the same choice. 
And I want to set a new record, with the longest distance ever flown. 
Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. 
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there. 
It's too much. 
Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. 
You're going to see the action, three against three, completely autonomous. 
All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live, in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way, and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years, and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe. 
Somebody else has a design for it. 
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality, or to understand it or to change it, the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. 
We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule, typically a secret in our discipline. 
Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age, everything from old models of the corporation, government, media, Wall Street, are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing, and this is now creating a burning platform in the world. 
And have to do something with it." 
It's not a happy thought, but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. 
The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it. 
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
(Laughter) The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both. 
But that's a probabilistic statement. 
What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain, mostly without your awareness. 
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world. 
Here we are normally; we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless. 
Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself, "Something's always wrong when nothing's always right." 
That's what I think. 
So, given our new kind of science, is there a general way to use it to make technology? 
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. 
It might take 50 years or it might take 500 years, but it's going to happen nevertheless. 
And nobody really knows what epidemiology is. 
In my country, it was -- we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis; we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay. 
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent. 
I went to Bhutan. 
But I am very proud of my students. 
Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me. 
It's a research crop marijuana grow room. 
What's your view on that? 
And that's the good news I have. We can do that. 
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities, so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this. 
I call it the hockey puck. 
It's not just about taking a pill, and your performance and your pain getting better. 
A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation. 
The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation. 
Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg: "Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg." 
So, perspective is everything and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about, I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. 
And testing breakaway signpost pillars. 
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product, and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do. 
Is it sensitive? Yes. 
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background. 
And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town. 
For instance, in the last half-century, more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century. 
And I will do the one thing that I can do." 
The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. 
Okay? We're feeding seniors. 
Anyone who's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex. 
Now, six amateur astronomers, working with the Internet, with Dobsonian digital telescopes -- which are pretty much open source -- with some light sensors developed over the last 10 years, the Internet -- they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago. 
What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. 
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. 
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. 
Like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue. 
Could it be there is something more going on here? 
And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights -- just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road, polarizers can block the shine off of the skin, so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. 
So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song. 
So what does it mean about defining life? 
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen, until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth, which is, you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car, if you use hydrogen. 
This is another behavior they requested. 
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make, produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years. 
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. 
Girl 2: That would be so stressful. 
Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents -- (Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath. 
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. 
A single drop of rain increasing amplitude. 
What can we do and encourage more online banking?" 
So even though I didn't grow any taller, I didn't sprout a beard, something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed. 
But we really have to educate. 
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. 
(Laughter) And how about finances? Anybody check that today? 
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes. 
I don't know if anybody's seen this -- it's pretty spectacular in the room. 
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding. 
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left, be it a real image or a synthetic image, it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column, regions of different colors, different luminances. 
So what is the problem with vultures? 
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. 
And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about. 
It's a kind of mechanistic world that we'd all love to live in where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets, everything is numerically expressible, and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success. 
The stars aligned, and she came back. 
You've got to try it on your own to believe it. 
One in 100 will die from it. 
And that's because it's been protected, that it has come back. 
And the third night, he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very, very famous cap. 
Now why. 
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News. 
It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba. 
Thank you very much. 
I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do. 
And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple, very gender-specific colors to females, right? 
Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. 
Bed nets are very cheap. 
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. 
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way -- with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from. 
Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart, what would be your reason? 
There's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America, and it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis, when, you know, mass consolidation, mass exodus of small farmers in this country. 
Sometimes, soon after giving birth, some women become depressed, and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic. 
We're not looking to start a fund, but we want somebody else to do this. 
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher to do more?" How to access the digital world? 
But people prevailed on us, and we got together, and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative. 
So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen, the four founders, well, we would've been broke, we would've been homeless, sitting on the street with mustaches. (Laughter) But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing that happens, so what? 
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling. 
The things we know are still important. 
In Dubai this year, we've just had the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show. 
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult. 
JS: Okay. Wet hands. 
It's manifestations of a disease. 
By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago? 
And my grandmother one time said, "No, look, you’re not going to run away. 
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. 
It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. 
I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there, was destroyed by the attacks, and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. 
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept. 
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community. 
And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. 
The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion, and that is the commodity booms. 
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn't travel with me. 
It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries. 
The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother, and nobody congratulates the father. 
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK? 
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred. 
It's a serious gene. 
A few years later, the Iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration, a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again. 
That, to me, is an incredible thing. 
Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope. 
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free, virtually free, and was very easy to use. 
But in the process, we set ourselves up to be isolated. 
We associate repetition with boredom. 
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. 
I named this group of artists around an idea, which I put out there called post-black, really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now, looking back at history but start in this moment, historically. 
Now reusing is vital. 
You see the glacier flowing in from the right, dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour. 
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online, and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property." 
So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love. 
In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. 
Its shape was too complex now. 
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning. 
Girl 2: I think we -- the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV is because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer. 
And the house that I had spent time in was empty. 
We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth. 
Love came to visit me, shy as a fawn. 
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. 
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall. 
Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible, and in support of that have decided to do two things. 
It doesn't work. 
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. 
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. 
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices. 
And worst of all, we will never know. 
And that was, "How did this happen to me?" 
So where do we go? 
But such a teacher is seldom found. 
She dropped them off, and then they would swim away. 
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life, uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family. 
He said, "I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street. 
So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub. 
DH: Leap over my shoulder. 
They use it synecdochically. 
I want to compete. 
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. 
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad. 
But the Victorians actually did it. 
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?" 
The jewel beetle survived for thousands, perhaps millions of years, using simple tricks and hacks. 
which was indeed the case in Europe between 1650 and 1750. 
(Laughter) So there they are. 
If you look at the world, you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent. 
Lem Sen, who's this guy: I would have made this money, too, but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. 
I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages, coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. 
Man's best friend in the fight against malaria. 
Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. 
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them. 
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device so I can measure your grip strength? 
My mother thought that this was not very proper, so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. 
But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin. 
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body. 
Some of my reporters were arrested. 
So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them, you’ll find something taped underneath it. 
Now these are controversial questions, and so we tend to shrink from them. 
And that would be bad. 
The first is, technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we're on where output goes up over time, while at the same time, prices go down, and volume and quality just continue to explode. 
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. 
And then the Moon in the center, and it's floating. And this is in France. 
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain, because I know you like that here at TED, so if you just give me a minute here, okay. 
Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. 
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections. 
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread. 
(Applause) AG: Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2G model, grassroots to global. 
And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. 
Please turn off your radio, Eleanor. 
(Laughter) I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is. 
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. 
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken? 
Why is this happening? 
Now this is a dependence too, but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people. 
Look, this is the tetrapak -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment. 
So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. 
Never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China. 
Here is not like anywhere else. 
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. 
So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth. 
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap. 
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. 
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from, and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes. 
Let me show you what you could do right now. 
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger. 
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels. 
So, that's what I want to talk about today. 
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something. 
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left. 
It also meant, then, if you can imagine this, that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in. 
Design does that. 
Other people thought it was funny. 
OK? Now, we’re dealing with people who only want results, and this is the commercial world. 
So we went to the white pages, and we found, we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook, and we looked through a couple of different addresses, and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house. 
You can see there's some signals there. 
It's an issue for the women's movement. 
Two hundred years ago, the United States was less than a few percent urbanized. 
(Laughter) And it's very interesting to see that the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu, number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. 
And third, the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance. 
(Applause) But it was only the beginning. 
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet. 
So, even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this, really, we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. 
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself step after step after step. 
Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands, by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. 
♫ We don't need no more ... ♫ Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war. 
You can erase that, you really can, because it's not true anymore. (Applause) It's transformational. 
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells. 
I got to do what many women have -- the jelly on the belly and bzzzz. 
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. 
CP: You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. 
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA. 
In fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life, and we can see that happening; just as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make. 
It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe. 
It was my mother with five little children. 
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead, and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it, "Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini-van." 
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life? 
(Laughter) There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis. 
Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive; four percent of them have been "other." 
And what does all of that mean? 
So, this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. 
And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age, there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy, and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill, and saying to each other, "Yeah, this wheel thing, cool toy, sure, but compared to fire, it will have no impact. 
I mean, they complain about it all the time. 
Today, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered. 
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled. 
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way, human rights matters because of the other things it brings, or women's rights matters for the other things it brings. 
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities. 
The number of beavers started to increase, because beavers like to eat the trees. 
Oh. 
The magazines started to cover it. 
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from? 
I want you to breathe in. This is what I say. 
How does it scale? 
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. 
Let's talk about past and future billions. 
Now you can have my cancer, too! 
We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. 
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution. 
It is to take a risk, because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. 
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side, I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal. 
She founded the hospice movement. 
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass. 
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it? 
And by linking these together, we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest, instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings. 
The third year, the total was up to around 40. 
It's a plan, looking down from above. 
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren, but I want to turn now to Goering, who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg. 
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. 
These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders, and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns. 
We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today. 
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. 
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. 
Two months later, I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief. 
See it uncurl and then peel these toes. 
She was a state senator at the time, and we met here, at the airport, before a trip to China. 
Every day you go up north here and there. 
And they weren't flashing in anger, they were flashing in love, intense love for her students. 
There she is. 
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar, but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there, and it is: when does it mean something to a child? 
Now we're going to put that in the context of the music. 
Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek. 
Jody Williams called it: It's good to meditate. 
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI is the longevity of technologies, and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time. 
I can take these children and in 20 weeks, demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent. 
Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it. 
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. 
I felt misled. 
Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message, then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak. 
So what I want you to do is -- fingers. 
How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever? 
Think about seat belts. 
As I said, there are very few superficial signs that I've been away. 
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did. 
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. 
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. 
And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. 
Here's an example. 
Then you have to convince your colleagues. 
But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. 
(Video) Children: One, two, three, go. 
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. 
Remember I said it runs in families? 
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch. 
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. 
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started. 
It's a world of phantoms, where particles can also behave like spread-out waves. 
So the training of the troops has to change. 
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops. 
Think African governments will put together a conference like this? 
There are a lot of people who are frustrated." 
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room. 
And in this way, you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works, what doesn't work and why. 
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now, and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses. 
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era. 
It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible. 
This is the design situation: a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. 
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble. 
Western medicine can't touch those. I cure them." 
You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference, and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon. 
And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star, it becomes a planet. 
So I dove through the inner tube, and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles. 
And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. 
These are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved. 
But then we see extraordinary differences. 
And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us. 
You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else. 
And there I was crying away, and smash, bash on my rock. 
But actually they are cruel to themselves. 
And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space. 
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed. 
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening. 
(Applause) Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi. 
To give you one example of the impact this can have, this little boy, eight years old, walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort. 
It's all of us in this together, not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. 
It's just that I've been so busy because school started, as you might not know, probably, since you're a whale, you don't know, and I'm calling you to just say, to wish you a merry Christmas. 
EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes. 
But it is a gross distortion of reality. 
There was no surveillance footage from the shop. 
And he wanted one so badly. 
Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. 
Well, there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story, who had 75 children living in his house. 
Now, those people both have four friends, but A's friends all know each other, and B's friends do not. 
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack. 
So we asked ourselves, can the babies take statistics on a brand new language? 
(Applause) The second wish is, at the present time, the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators -- that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches -- appears to be quite successful. 
And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. 
At age 31 -- that's my age now -- in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming, and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming. 
It's totally fundamental to who we are. 
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers. 
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster. 
You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time. 
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. 
But can you reconcile that? 
I was lost. 
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter) And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. 
Are you with child? 
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s. 
There are two pop-ups bringing you some other information, and a final article with a link out to the original article. 
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. 
And we can measure this very precisely, actually, because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day, and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel, where you are, what you're thinking about. 
This is the picture. 
I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even 24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours. 
What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with, the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach. 
We can't stop our kids from using it. 
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little, "Shh -- it's not really them," was put on the side of the imagery. 
And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country, none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly, "All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers. 
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. 
Can you not figure out how to do it, or something? 
And so the encoder does just what I was saying: it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code. 
In a way, it's the story of my life. 
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today, because today as well, there are some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia. 
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day. 
We've got a different solution. 
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they loved, living on the frontiers of possibility. 
It's never going to work. You can't do it." 
Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. 
People have also wanted to deconstruct. 
Now, when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil, including buildings, industry, feedstocks and so on, you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025, well, about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then, with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over, at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel, instead of 26 for buying the oil. 
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse. 
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students. 
That's in New Mexico. 
He wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense, would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?" 
That's a challenge for 21st-century science. 
There were some people who were really gang-affiliated, and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school. 
But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background, is this kind of odd undulation. 
So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine," and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today, that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength, the medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing, right, you get some beautiful results, even when we didn't have very good technologies. 
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked, but I think for TED you are. 
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. 
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness." 
Last point, intelligence community -- the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. 
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. 
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. 
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller." 
Well, there are several ways. 
Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. 
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles. 
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time. 
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. 
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. 
We're in good enough shape. 
That all that, discovered in 40 years, had not been in the previous hundred thousand, was not for lack of thinking about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had. 
It's called the Dunning–Kruger effect. 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod. 
One is not prime. 
And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment. 
You know, between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about. 
Basically promoting fun. 
This is the Italian portal, the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park. 
She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed, she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on. 
When I was growing up in the '70s, the typical American spent one tenth of their income, American family, on transportation. 
So it's systemic across the entire country. 
And the farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere, the better. 
And let me take you back 100 years to 1912. 
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. 
But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time. 
The buyer was Kip Forbes, son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century. 
Now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed, imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations. 
This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba at that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone, and you probably died. 
And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no. 
She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school, middle school, and then in high school, she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village, ever, to come to the United States on scholarship. 
But I just wanted to say -- and I mean this without irony -- I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. 
A new bubble will replace the old one. 
And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. 
And the game is very simple. 
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included: first, this skeleton documents, for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago. 
The first one is harm/care. 
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. 
This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 -- cooled the earth by half a degree. 
The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French. 
So my conclusion is very simple. 
And what that means is that every time you discuss the future, or any kind of a future event, grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. 
So I have one message. 
The 19-year-olds get tired from the switching, OK? 
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so. 
I [did] a master's degree in economics. 
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order. 
And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music. 
He’s not taking care of his troops. 
So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink. 
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate, and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet. 
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside, I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities. 
Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are, cadavers may not be easily available. 
Two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States. 
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million sharks. 
Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it. 
These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars, I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand. 
Thank you very much. 
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church, you'll be struck dead at the threshold. 
And that's why, next month in Morocco, a meeting is taking place between all the countries. 
And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes. 
You need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. 
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it. 
Good job. Good job. 
I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art. 
To another group of subjects, we told them, "Students and faculty will see your answers." 
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine, although they're part and parcel of our African reality, they are not the only reality. 
I had to do that properly. 
This was not an oral history program. 
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. 
So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities. 
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of long-term flows of people, is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first-generation immigrants? 
But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much. 
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp." 
And you'll see soon that my graduate student ... 
Here's the MR. It provides the framework. 
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. 
We didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system, we didn't have any data about the things that mattered, and we didn't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime. 
I was not going to say no. 
I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? 
And so of course, radically unlike the real world, and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding very, very quickly, and historically exponentially. 
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. 
PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me. 
I've been building topsoil. 
And I went through a mental exercise actually, because I started a patient support community of my own on a website, and one of my friends, one of my relatives actually, said, "Look, Dave, who grew this thing? 
So that's joy. Joy fires up. 
So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. 
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. 
Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? 
I want to talk about something quite different, which is what I know about, and that is astronomy. 
You know? 
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called "The Human Moment," about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person. 
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. 
But because you don't have many other openings, the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong, active and even violent. 
Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith. 
Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term DDOS service or scheduled attack, starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to 10 to 50 dollars per hour. 
And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. 
Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life. 
When seeking melodic inspiration, look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language. 
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with. 
That was really exciting for us to see that. 
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible. 
A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. 
This project has lasted now, been just over two years. 
It's two breeding cycles for maize. 
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. 
It's the participation age, right? 
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because, although I am 94, I am not still working. 
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector. 
And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTalk today. 
It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology; it's a time for tears. 
I simply said, "If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead, who will lead business and industry? 
From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition, I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future. 
So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity, but even more, we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. 
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question, "What can we learn from this organism?" 
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?" 
Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right? 
We have to make the right moral decision. 
Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. 
Come out of the station, West 4th near the park, brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks, 'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?' I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.' They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes. 
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids. 
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect. 
So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. 
Run for your heterosexual lives. 
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. 
How do you build a better health care system? 
And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity, and was taking all of these elements into my mind, I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. 
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented. 
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. 
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife. 
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. 
So I found that they had a friend, a local accountant, a young girl, and they played football with her. 
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells, I think that better things are on the way. 
I had no movement in my legs. I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots. 
And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat, despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies. 
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long, one of the largest reservoirs ever created. 
And one of my most enduring memories is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone." 
And you can do so from the comfort of your own home, without the risks associated with buying on the streets. 
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary. 
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it. 
And in the last paragraph of the book, it's a kind of stylistic mark, because normally Charles Darwin stored, in the last paragraph of a book, the most important message. 
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image. 
(Laughter) I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" 
Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [court]. 
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria? 
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money? 
Cities, past and future. 
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy. 
That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody. 
It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. 
The continental landmasses drifted around. 
It was just completely off the wall. 
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. 
One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. 
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah! 
And two magical things happened after he was born. 
(Music) (Applause) Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm. 
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting. 
For me, I look at the paintings on the wall and I think, somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it. 
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. 
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. 
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it. 
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much, but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline, and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year, all the way up to 30 cents by 2020, that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption, and at the same time we would give people time to prepare, time to respond, and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. 
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right? 
We went down into the Rift Valley. 
This is What Lemmings Believe. 
Unfortunately, when I was there I couldn't find one of them, but you have the antlers as proof. 
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. 
And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room. 
Within a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words. 
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system, and finally we looked at the economics, and what I mean by economics is, what is the energy required to run the system? 
You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat? 
I'm a believer in global warming, and my record is good on the subject. 
And now he's looking at the other guy, saying, "You are really weird." 
There are starfish that can make light. 
Sorry, start again. 
It's a colonial animal. 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
And the desire part comes, I guess, from social status, right? 
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes. 
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow. 
You can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up. 
That's our motto: "Whenever you are, we're already then." 
And stress, worry, anger all decrease with age. 
This is an area of about 50 million hectares. 
(Machine gun fire) Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. 
And then, what's next? 
Fifty years ago, the journey to find answers took a different path and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, began. 
Her mother was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her. 
People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for very good reason. 
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident. 
It's based on the presumption, the observation even, that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages. 
Shukran! (Applause) Good morning. 
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody? 
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement, which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones. 
And they collect the seeds. All over the world. 
This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent. 
For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband. 
And the job in question was sheep rancher. 
It's just the way you throw your board over. 
Here I've been, playing God with my friends' lives, my friends' son, with Natasha's life, and this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people. 
One man, President Robert Mugabe, is almost single-handedly responsible for having destroyed this country. 
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what Freud called ordinary misery. 
Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.

After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks, the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. 
And it has been my home these years. 
So, you have to understand that past. 
Because this is what we want. This is what we want. 
But even with that, there still was another big hurdle, and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome, because we're all different. 
Well, if you want to fly, it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds. 
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. 
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard. 
Things in life start out being general cell, and they become specialized: You have tissue cells, you have muscle, brain cells. And same things happens with say, a hammer, which is general at first and becomes more specific. 
And remember, this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware. 
Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this. 
And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist. 
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?" 
And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great. They analyze large populations. 
And I'm on this. 
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that. 
First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now. 
None can make a stitch in time. 
It was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?" 
That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum. 
You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. 
But now, in the blink of an eye, the game has changed again. 
It's a history of invention based around this. 
And when it goes, we're always happy. 
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. 
So, imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out. 
Well there, I think the answer is very clear: They're in business. 
There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes, that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell, but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body. 
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential. 
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. 
You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. 
Muito obrigado, thank you. 
It's perfectly fine. 
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there. 
After I was invited by TED, I did some digging, because that's what we do, to know about my host. 
(Applause) Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60, and I don't like being 60. 
So it's a straightforward machine. 
Now I want to show you one last video. 
So, I decided to investigate. 
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork; should I do advertising? -- at the time. 
Go regional and go to urban food systems. 
Now, why is that a problem? 
My favorite page is the "About the author" page. 
We tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away, by the opposite of what we see when we take it away. 
I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, "You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. 
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons. 
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. 
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya." 
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg. 
And in the end, quite often, the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out: "If I give you my date of birth, can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?" 
But I don't buy anything new. 
So, the fabric of the brain, even though your brain may be smaller, bigger, it may have different types of neurons, different morphologies of neurons, we actually do share the same fabric. 
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice, equity, truth, becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education, our approach to health, or strategies for achieving an economics of equity. 
Of course, we should do all things, in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree. 
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting. 
But if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls and just line them up, they line up like this. 
Well it turns out that the babies, the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings. 
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something. 
You know, when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible, the ICSE curriculum. 
It's sort of like when Galileo invented -- or, didn't invent -- came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way, or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope -- or actually invented -- and could see biology in a new way. 
What's the goal? 
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run. 
(Applause) Take a look at this picture. 
Our choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people, then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect. 
So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience, I tried to understand: where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy? 
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school, because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out, and I don't know what, sitting in cafes. 
It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. 
I got a scholarship, went to university, studied international agriculture, studied anthropology, and decided I was going to give back. 
"But what if I saw them? You know, couldn't we stay together?" "No." 
We're still working at this story, we're still developing it, we're still expanding it. 
Thank you. 
That's the number for us to beat." 
So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. 
And that was what I did. 
And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great. 
Or is it other countries? 
Now, in this state of de-animation, it could not go out dancing, but it was not dead, and it was not harmed. 
It's: This is what I have done because I'm excited by it, because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal. 
And those things are the reflection of the processes, and the time that they are made. 
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead. 
Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it. 
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest. 
This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values, and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai. 
Country A, in 1990, had about $300 per capita GDP as compared with Country B, which had $460 in per capita GDP. 
So we're trying to put that in computers in the field. 
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer, except there was one problem. 
Now when we were out tagging our sharks, this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -- get in there fast -- occasionally the sharks do react. 
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed -- which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern. 
While I was working at the U.N., I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. 
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. 
So the bottom line is, empower your children. 
We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. 
(Laughter) It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. 
500 years ago, it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. 
So for instance, here is somebody using the tool. 
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it, digging it up for many years, I end up looking at the mammal radiation, and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology, advancing by an order of magnitude. 
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be. 
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. 
So we built a three-stranded model. 
And this is Felix, actually. 
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. 
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man? 
When I was 16 in San Francisco, I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. 
We do not see reality as it is. 
Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed. 
How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life? 
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. 
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009. 
Now, let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip, or your stem cells and put them on a chip. 
And the second thing was, one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like, "Oh. 
The more it changes, the faster it changes. 
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem. 
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia, like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away; or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. 
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable. 
A judge would let her out." 
I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. 
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N. 
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations. 
So here's a little fractal model for it. 
There's a lot of material available -- newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books. 
In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle. 
And if she faces an unexpected issue, the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center, let them see what she sees, transmit data that they can run through diagnostics, and they can stream videos that will guide her, step by step, through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running. 
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. 
Some pay the price for it. 
My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition that was about to open, and I came across this. 
I want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins, who would like to ban these sorts of technologies, or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them, are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us. 
So it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. 
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. 
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. 
I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life. 
They're not. 
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there. 
The whole thing about my house, the whole use of rough carpentry and everything, was the frustration with the crafts available. 
(Laughter) Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text. 
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species? 
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool, pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. 
The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters, all one billion of them, are building the urban world, which means they're building the world -- personally, one by one, family by family, clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood. 
We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility. 
We obtained an influenza vaccine, we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin, and we waited -- and this is in the live animal. 
I had a rigorous scientific transect. 
Now if we look at the economic imperative here, this isn't just about compassion. 
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube. 
You see it there? There? Watch it come down. 
Because if you think about it, you're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds, whatever, flying around this universe. 
And they did innovation in design and beyond. 
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience: If civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular, governments, governments and their international institutions, but also large international actors, in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society, government and private sector, there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world. 
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. 
And she said, "And then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination. 
Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. 
So I thought, well they like to play games. 
And so the following day, I went to the orthopedic center. 
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things, so he starts chocolate-dipping edges, changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity. 
This year, there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose, that we could -- right now, we could save them all. 
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park. 
(Laughter) So even with that caveat, I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. 
And when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like Barbara in the movie -- they get treated. 
Thank you. (Applause) I want to talk to you about something kind of big. 
South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones. 
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat, a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals, and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world. 
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them. 
So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks. 
What are the figures he's relying on? 
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term, but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs, deprived early on, become more susceptible to disease. 
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. 
But then we looked at recent urban development, and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street, 30 years ago. All bikes, no cars. 
(Laughter) And they say, "Will you build it in my district?" 
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. 
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish, is different, and our paths will be different, they are all stories. 
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those. 
More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean. 
We called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out, which is quite fun. 
(Laughter) Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented, but it does happen all the time. 
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence. 
It stops. 
And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political, economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were: their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit, from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse. 
So now for the topic of today: financial savings. 
But as that space shuttle returns to Earth, and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field, they begin to see the effects of gravity. 
So, what happened though, over the course of the last 20 years -- we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. 
It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am, of what I've already done. 
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. 
Last year, I created a one-man show. 
What gem of knowledge? 
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so-called primitives of the world. 
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. 
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?" 
Thank you. 
I realize that's an ambiguous statement. 
20 years ago, if someone had said to me, "John, do you really want to make a difference?" 
A flock of relatives descended on her. 
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. 
That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that. 
Here in America, people actually love TV. 
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing. 
Fildes' oldest son, Philip, died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness. 
These changes are detailed in many books. 
Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy. 
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys. 
Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy? 
A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history. 
We've talked about stem cells tonight. 
I hope you won't be disappointed, but today, I won't be talking about blue algae. 
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections. 
So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line. 
But barely six months into my new job, I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions. 
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers. 
Children sound different from teens who sound different from adults. 
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. 
It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note. 
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
You're going to need caregivers. 
It was May, 2011, and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home, although I have a car and an international driver's license. 
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles, yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool. 
And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it. 
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking. 
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these. 
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. 
It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them. 
(Laughter) And this is my most well-known cartoon. 
But on the other hand, something is wrong. 
That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists, as you well know, have lots of experimental preps, worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this. 
I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system-going civilization and species. 
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote. 
Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... 
So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him, but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right? 
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. 
Thank you so much. 
Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. 
Open defecation is rampant. 
They are just discovering. 
Well, it enables you to drink coffee. 
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go? 
What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. 
We would film that and air it, and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. 
Now we didn't write this app. 
At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird. 
They've called me "brother" and "uncle" and invited me again and again over five years. 
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live. 
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity," was all I could think of. What is virtue? 
We've privileged safety over experience and we've gained a lot in doing so, but I think we've lost something too. 
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. 
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed? 
Immediately someone went to get orange juice, someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop. 
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. 
We provide the patients, the Afghan disabled, first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration. 
(Laughter) And they all looked angry. 
But in fact, they're growing faster. 
This is what these other cultures demand. 
Thank you very much. 
The one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II. 
Well, what if -- because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff. 
You see, what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. 
Go ahead and play that. 
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. 
Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms. 
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder. 
Your mom could get cancer, your dad could get mean. 
And there's a verification taking place. 
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier. 
And here, scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. 
Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between 1940 and 1945? 
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four. 
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper. 
Oh, so cities make us safer because we're driving less? 
I don't believe in joints, but they do hold your body together.'" -- It's an example of loose associations. -- "Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room, and once there, I couldn't settle down. 
Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN. 
And I came across my parents doing something unusual, where they were laughing. 
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. 
I was then 19 years old. 
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know. 
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara, California in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI. 
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, aqueducts, factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on. 
But that care means also you learn. 
And I think that as we look at culture, we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. 
In this task, you see a set of shelves. 
The average US citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons. 
I wrote the code and put it out there. 
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. 
We really need to change it. 
And that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding action and start demanding progress. 
I think this is what we come with, at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. 
So this person's making different faces, and it's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking. 
Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks. 
I don't conceive of it that way. 
Thank you. 
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here. 
And we walked up this pathway, all the way up. 
The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments, the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time. 
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful. 
But then they often wait there. 
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. 
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden: SEAL Team Six. 
Is it just a fluke? 
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know, when all else is equal, given the option to have just money to do what you need to do, or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community, people choose the community plus the money. 
And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. 
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship, an authoritarian regime, that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation, within the people themselves. 
In the 1990s, we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem. 
So when designers are working on ideas, they can start building stuff whenever they want. 
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there. 
In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi, I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. 
Any one-four elements get to the gate! 
I want to tell you about another disorder. 
At least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated. 
So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling. 
And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. 
Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments in Africa where I grew up, and I loved wildlife, and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. 
They don't. Nobody knows what it is. 
And they left. 
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. 
If you have money, of course, you can get the value. 
We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. 
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. 
We're born makers. 
And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days. 
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums. 
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually, it was. 
It'd be really interesting if you came. 
You cleaned up my room. 
(Applause) Joann Butler: 005961. 
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way. 
I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back up on this stage, maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. 
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing. 
What do you want to hear at the very end, and from whom would you like to hear it? 
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public. 
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. 
So there, we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation. (Music) (Applause) Now my career may last a little longer! 
And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. 
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence of grades and standards and market information, sacks have to be constantly changed. 
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent, I want some sites to understand my habits. 
I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting. 
And we did, and we traveled around, and we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses, we held press conferences, we went out with soldiers, we sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO, we sat down with the U.K. government. 
And they have become excellent partners. 
I mean, it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. 
But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this, that where there is trust, there is music -- by extension life. 
This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. 
Last year, at this time, there were 20 vessels, 500 mariners held hostage. 
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst. 
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati, and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. 
Two of my students, Jim and James, traveled around India and Thailand, starting to think about this problem a lot. 
So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death. 
This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. 
Dynamically, it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. 
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. 
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter) And we were very, very happy. 
I think it's time for a bold move. 
And this caused me to scratch my head, because as I went back through his several-hundred-page book, I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table, reference or footnote. 
And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. 
It's called dispositional humor. 
We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study, and we took a shot with a webcam, and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. 
And you know, I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. 
And then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm. 
Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. 
This actually is one of DARPA's very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects. 
So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. 
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way. 
And as we go from naught to 0.1 second, it becomes more ticklish. 
So you have to be prepared. 
And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. 
There's consequences for carbonate organisms. 
And everybody outside thought we were dying. 
Healing: this is a good one. 
Then a bass player named Ray Brown, and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine, and a piano player named Herbie Hancock, and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra, and a fellow named Tito Puente, and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter, and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city. 
(Laughter) While, somewhat, the Spaniards ... 
We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. 
Companies followed the waterfall method, right, in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below, and no one had ever consulted the programmers. 
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do. 
We may see the eradication of polio this year. 
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing." 
Because we instinctively find, or create, a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba, and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. 
So that Roman society was very top/bottom, as ours is to some degree. 
Everybody begins to move around, and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not? 
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise. 
People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience. 
the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate. 
She had to stop working. 
So let's give this a try. 
So he doesn't actually do anything himself. 
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles. 
(Laughter) I let that pass. 
My siblings are all going to school. 
So those blue bottles, those blue bottles save lives, and they're also worth billions, sometimes billions a year. 
And she does drawings, right? 
(Laughter) So he asked me -- (Applause) "So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?" 
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine. 
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response, which is, effectively, recognition. 
These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks. 
But I think we're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do. 
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try. 
Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. 
Okay. (Laughter) They wanted it to end precisely on time. 
(Applause) Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so I've never seen color, and I don't know what color looks like, because I come from a grayscale world. 
He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot, and morale went up. 
Even that though. Another confession: Once in a book on pre-war Poland, a studio portrait, an absolute angel, an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes. 
JU: It's been a great pleasure. 
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. 
Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient. 
(Laughter) Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge. 
And he has a theory that it is possible -- it is possible -- that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music, because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone. 
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know, hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. 
And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life" from the bookstore here at TED. 
So let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. 
What is really important is, can we reduce that death toll? Can we save some of those 19,000 children dying every day? 
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days. 
And these are facts, guys. 
It wasn't a baby, she was three. 
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her. 
I said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white? 
For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. 
(Applause) Secondly, it's not about test scores only. 
So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface, on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself. 
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here: Pogo's been quoted; Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out. 
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine. 
You guys have very insecure computers, OK? 
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?" 
You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem. 
A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry, and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration. 
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves. 
And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated. 
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints. 
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand. 
Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. 
Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny. 
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. 
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. 
It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two, which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data. 
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. 
(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway. 
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. 
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school. 
And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve. 
And that's not the only place it's found. 
There are 12 stadia probably to come, but there are 32 training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train. 
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. 
I wish for a better life. 
Not one customer would refer us. 
But it seems like people don't want to hear so much, or listen, or try to have an exchange. 
We create mountains of waste. 
You're sitting on chairs. 
And they're going to be playing this clip: "I'm such a good mother." 
You could drop an atom bomb on a city, and 30 years later it's surviving. 
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. 
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. 
My background is not exactly conventional medical training. 
He was a working kind of guy. 
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks. 
Next, we need proper science, proper evidence. 
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. 
Thank you very much. 
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. 
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone, you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers, okay. 
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project. 
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris to see how insanely fast it's growing. 
And it was quite an experience to be there. 
This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. 
And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel. 
For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported by the constraints of tradition, I believe that self-mockery is one of the best means for the relationship to endure. 
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. 
And our lives will never be the same. 
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience. 
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. 
Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son, and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. 
And we found it in the concrete. 
Now, this dot here is called JET, the Joint European Torus. 
And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams, and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." 
After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. 
How can that not make you optimistic? 
So what did they do? 
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote, "How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp." 
So, let’s go out into the world and take this caring, this love, this respect that we’ve shown each other right here at TED, and take this out into the world. 
And she still actually has those. 
Now as soon as I had this idea, I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. 
Well how good a city council you have, how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge. 
Peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do. 
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo. 
And then, when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace, she needed someone to help her do the transport, so she hired her husband. 
In 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective of computer security. 
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice, saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children, and their children in turn. 
And he decides to paint her. 
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States and the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition: John Cage's "4:33," written for any instrument or combination of instruments. 
And you have a problem making ends meet. 
It's not sustainable. 
Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it, video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. 
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. 
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. 
It's called sheep's organs. 
(Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the history of music and television on the Internet in three minutes. 
(Applause) Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team. 
What's number one? 
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest in broadband and science education and science grants, but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have. 
And that's in the up position. When you step on it, either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot, it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure, anything from five feet to 30 feet. 
It took me some time to come to my senses. 
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground. 
So we did some really simple things. 
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother. 
And my first year at Caltech, I continued the business. 
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage. 
So he's a religious figure, as Rattray would have said, as well as a political figure. 
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. 
(Applause) Thank you so much. (Applause) I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work. 
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. 
You cling to your land because it is your secure place. 
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin? 
We also did a lot of calculation. 
So there's always a strong ecological component in the project. 
So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion, get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions. 
We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo. 
It did mine. 
I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior. 
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous "binders full of women" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing," including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode. (Laughter) All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. 
You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks. 
A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process. 
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. 
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid, they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. 
Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good." 
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book, "World 3.0," that we're very, very far from the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent. 
Adults, on the whole, are solemn. 
Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet, it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you. 
Now, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you -- I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale, all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale. 
Do you have that love? 
And when we die, we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs. 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. 
Those are then selected by the algorithm, reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. 
So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try -- this is how not to learn wire walking. 
And a third question: Education. 
(Applause) Chromosome one, top left. 
And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ... 
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. 
You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. 
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid. 
She's really rushing back, because it's hot, to try to feed her chicks. 
What's even more surprising is that self-grades, where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades. 
On a frame-by-frame basis, we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad. 
They're not rational about probability. 
Market exchange, they assume, doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged. 
The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. 
A rating can range from a so-called AAA, which means it's a top-performing product, and it can go down to the level of the so-called BBB-, which means it's a fairly risky investment. 
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good things that have happened, but equally, it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society. 
And she said, "You matter because you are, and you matter to the last moment of your life." 
Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. 
And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone. 
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use, which I think is a pretty cool concept, although I think it ought to work the other way around, that it gets brighter the more you don't use. 
There are real concerns there. 
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran, where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. 
And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly -- (Laughter) — they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game, and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation, including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. 
It was really interesting. 
We're going to the dry season now. 
About a year after 9/11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. 
Same thing with every single password and so on. 
This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice, and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. 
I had tears rolling down my cheeks. 
But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get, collect together, those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres. 
And yet I forget about it all the time. 
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this. 
DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. 
(Applause) It's a great honor to be here with you. 
And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can. 
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs. 
We thought it would be really neat to do that, and one of the problems we really were worried about is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk? 
But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. 
(Laughter) Thank you very much. 
The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans. 
And I remembered his son was in our force. 
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life. 
We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz, but we weren't able to do that. 
As much as you might like to think, as I do, that you're the kind of person who doesn't quit, that you'll go down swinging, hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice. 
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." 
They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive. 
And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places -- poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes. 
That's triple bottom line! Okay? 
So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons, the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses. 
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it. 
BF: It's progress, that's the thing. 
I had no idea where to begin. 
We would die by the billions, and very quickly: The wolves would get us, we would be defenseless, we would be unable to grow enough food, or find enough food. 
♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫ ♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫ ♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫ ♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫ ♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫ ♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫ ♫ Have but I don't have ♫ ♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫ ♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫ 
And they have humility. 
Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. 
When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. 
But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply, we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need. 
"Look at their bellies, pink. 
There are many different kinds of mess. 
And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. 
So, what are the common denominators in these three cultures? 
The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress." 
Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill? 
And we see that in things like Flickr, or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. 
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great? 
So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish. 
And there was a lot of terror. 
He goes, "I thought you were my driver." 
Today it's $10,000. Next year it's $1,000. 
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule. 
And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. 
Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive? 
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems. 
Your seat, your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. 
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half. 
KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. 
And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses. 
It's very, very, very detailed inside with the design. 
There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter) LB: These works are on China's cultural memories. 
Because we had this auction, you see. 
ST: So for the moment, we can't really say if it's just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial. 
For her, life had distilled itself into one task: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. 
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal; Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya -- Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim and one-third animist, the community is -- Ollantaytambo, Peru, and Arctic Village, Alaska. 
And so I think that we evolved ... 
(Laughter) But more importantly, she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull. 
(Singing) Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. 
I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories, which are innovation, competitions and social investing. 
If you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do? 
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward. 
And then we can see that this is one combination of private, international, multilateral money, private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership, so that aid can be a facilitator. 
Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. 
This is a movement for everyone. 
So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense. 
You can see it even better from down on top. 
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar. 
And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam to Hama and there's no bridge. 
Right? And we started talking. 
(Laughter) ... if we use pennies. 
But is that good evidence? 
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, "Kim, I figured it out. 
CA: Thank you. (Applause) In the ocean, what is the common point between oil, plastic and radioactivity? 
I want to be independent. 
But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. 
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body." 
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century. 
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise. 
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers. 
It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency." 
There are smaller animals crawling around. 
This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ. 
It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy. 
Global is the new scale. We know that. 
And he pulled the whole mean down, destroying my statistical significance of the test. 
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, "all day and every day," not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself. 
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. 
You start looking at how the global plane flights move, and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. 
Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. 
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. 
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air. 
I'll get to you now the incidents of the day. 
Indeed, the whole container. 
10 percent. 10 percent. 
And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right? 
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. 
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it, so I'm not sure that you can. 
They'd better be good. 
Literature has to take us beyond. 
This is the market leader in malware distribution, the Black Hole Exploit Pack, responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters. 
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. 
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they're taking statistics. 
Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. 
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots. 
And if I can get the camera -- okay, great -- you'll see, as I get sort of close... 
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. 
And the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature. 
And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not, and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic, architectural. 
Well, maybe not. 
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone, and her mom buys her a robot. 
This, combined with a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic, is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink. 
You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. 
There is no free market for oil. 
His name was Khaled Said. 
We took irregular dosage. 
The story begins in the late '90s. 
I almost never cook with it. 
So think about it. 
It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising. 
Ready and go ... um. (Clicks metronome) (Clicks metronome) The duet starts. (Clicks metronome) (Clicks metronome) So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause) So good. So -- (Applause) Okay. So that was -- (Applause) Well done. (Applause) That was the second way of working. 
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2. 
This is in 2011. 
This is another sound from my group. 
And for the last decade, I've been asking myself why that is. 
And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best. 
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part -- which explains the third consistent component of regret, which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. 
How do you do that? That's water upside down. 
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. 
So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer. 
That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. 
(Laughter) I was never here. 
Think about it for a second: there is no standard Google anymore. 
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted, just like I wasted a day. 
Since they're doing some of these same jobs, maybe they should have some of those things. 
It has lower taxes. 
(Laughter) And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation, because they hadn't invented the off switch. 
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers. 
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is. 
So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. 
(Laughter) That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird, she's very interested in things that fly. 
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy. 
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor. 
We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments, how many of them we create, how many of them we acknowledge, how many of them we pay forward, and how many of them we say thank you for. 
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg. 
And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. 
Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me. 
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio, no way. 
Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad. 
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. 
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age. 
This collagen is the stuff between cells. 
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa. 
I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. 
It can be extended even to other species. 
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures. 
Is that your opinion? 
Now which one of these looks odd to you? 
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. 
Free-styler: ♫ I'm like some kind of [unclear] ♫ ♫ [unclear] extraterrestrial, celestial scene ♫ ♫ Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditate ♫ ♫ With two microphones hovering over my head ♫ ♫ See if I could still listen, spittin' off the sound ♫ ♫ See what you grinning ♫ ♫ I teach the children in the back of the classroom ♫ ♫ About the message of apocalyptical ♫ ♫ Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple ♫ ♫ [unclear] instrumental ♫ ♫ Detrimental playing Super Mario ♫ ♫ [unclear] boxes [unclear] hip hop ♫ 
There are so many genuine threats in the world. 
(Applause) The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when I was 15 years old. 
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. 
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. 
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact, so this is a type of neo-catastrophism, and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit; and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction. 
You shake it hard and it breaks apart. 
And their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly. 
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. 
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod." 
We're seeing the baby brain. 
That was the play part of the job. 
Lady: Will you glide with us? 
Human nature would have to change. 
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff. 
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa. 
Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity, not only is it home to three isolated tribes, but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre-Colombian art in the world: over 200,000 paintings. 
The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management. 
So it shows that we're really all in this together. 
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta, the largest man-made lake in the world. 
In addition, the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. 
But the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere? 
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. 
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. 
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others, knowing its place on the assembly line. 
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. 
JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized, "I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work up to that point, and threw it in a river. 
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. 
That's where he discovered something totally magical, and when he talks about it, it's fascinating -- it's the magic of dyeing chemistry. 
I want it to keep flying. 
You could now start doing surgery everywhere, on the gut, on the liver, on the heart, on the brain. 
So, three years ago, I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace. 
You ate food. 
I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have, we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub-parts, right, and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion, what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?" 
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works, because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you, you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah, I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating, I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating." (Laughter) But in between that we're going to do a simulation. 
The technologies do not exist to do that. 
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. 
But I did in fact get married in it. 
That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference. 
She just said, "Gabby was shot." 
No, not like that. 
Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. 
You see where it starts? September 2001, when we had something very real to be scared about. 
(Laughter) And then mount his airplane, maybe for the last time. 
Well, I blame the Queen. 
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me, using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship, but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development. 
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car, and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million. 
Ah, what a wonderful smell." 
If what we're interested in is regional stability, Egypt is far more important. 
And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. 
The technologies got better, and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law. 
She read two sentences. 
And we go through this several rounds. 
So, we've got now this flour. 
You try out 10 variations on that one. 
So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age. 
When you're done with all that, what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side. 
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice, simple family game. 
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes, and specifically by hormones. 
I think there are lots of -- I don't know how many -- but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right? 
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. 
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. 
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller. 
I also learned, don't reveal your source, because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from, and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more. 
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it. 
So what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say, have an interesting maxim they live by. 
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left, you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC. 
And he controls them from the top down -- whereas when they work for the other side, eventually, when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated, they actually, each one has a different, colorful kind of dress. 
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros. 
Teen prostitution is at its peak. 
We go back regularly. 
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. 
I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing. 
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. 
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted. 
Because these technologies are moving really quickly. 
And what they've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence. 
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. 
You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right? 
As long as they have infrastructure, mentorship and resources, they can build what they need, not only to survive, but to thrive. 
I wonder what the future will hold. 
We've got to change that. 
We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes, where they're not supposed to be. 
The best of here in the emerging economies -- I call them the New East -- they will jump the air line. 
These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms. 
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?" 
But why does anyone have to feel anything? 
Over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause) Expertise has for sure had its moments. 
['Academy Award for Special Effects - (First Year of Category)"] (Explosion) ["'2012' (2009)"]Governor: It seems to me that the worst is over. 
By the way, if this patient then goes, and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?" 
He rides his tractor. 
Dangerous troublemaker. 
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside? 
And in a way, without us even noticing, has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction, waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. 
It's very easy, win the million dollars. 
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. 
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it's not unique to diarrhea. 
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100,000 vibrations per second. 
My guess is, for what it's worth, is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years, 15, but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered; it has radically changed. 
Linda's symptoms continued. 
You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work." 
In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzingán decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. 
In 1943, T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets." 
That's -- that's not true. 
But he knew about the cheap and simple one. 
It's a new configuration that has never formed before. 
And as a result, people tend to spread out. 
So we look at a process of group dynamics: coalescence and fragmentation, groups coming together, groups breaking apart. 
Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself. 
And I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?" 
He's a cheeky little devil. 
We tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships, but in many cases it only strengthens them. 
What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog, that morning. 
I didn't know you actually have to have creative control. 
Okay? That had a big effect on me. 
OK, I'm going to do another cut. 
They don't catch them in a net. 
When I say realism, I mean photo-realism. 
It was left to my mother to educate me, and as George Lamming would say, it was my mother who fathered me. 
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things. 
And I think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference. 
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. 
So, a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields: whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc., it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature. 
And does purpose play into it? 
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. 
I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children, please. 
There is a glut of film, the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level, but I’m optimistic. 
It's a line scanner for the planet. 
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch -- so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency -- about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif* stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8:30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. 
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think the results so far have been remarkable, and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, while we get to the 2015 initiative. 
They had language, probably, because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us, which was discovered here in Oxford. 
It's not the same thing as good, better and best. 
And finally, at the ecosystem level, whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests, or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats, or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest, it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. 
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage. 
So I grew up hating lions so much. 
If you did, it would be because people had carved them. 
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim: to bring governance to the global space. 
Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands, suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. 
This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter, who is an extraordinary performer. 
Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. 
And so here I was saying, OK, I hear you, I understand what you're saying, but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions, then our survival is on the line. 
But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself. 
It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. 
And that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration, so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry. 
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. 
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods. 
The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight, who got the disease in Africa and brought it back. 
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder. 
So, when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America. 
The first step is pattern recognition. 
And this is what he did, he goes, he says, "Take your time." 
What does that mean? 
This is actually two of my favorites: the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. 
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. 
Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say, "Hey, let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor," and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur." 
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. 
It has many benefits. 
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it. 
In creativity I saw light. 
The question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. 
And we learned that small stuff stinks. 
Television? No. 
It's such a huge subject." 
And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: "Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride." 
I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. 
So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty, and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle. 
I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s, when I was seven or eight years old, watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. 
And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today. 
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away. 
And then they give you advice: "If you eat olive oil and vegetables, you'll have fewer skin wrinkles." 
(Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. 
"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause) I just want to say, over the last few years I've been -- had the opportunity to do this closing conference. 
And so, I've spent the last three years on this. 
If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden, you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results, as a little protest. 
We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce. 
(Rattling) So, a moment. 
Or would I go on television to demonstrate, in front of a live audience, that comfort foods really do make you feel better? 
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless, purposeless and dimensionless. 
We walk around on two legs. 
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. 
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out, okay? 
And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style. 
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. 
Since then, what's happened? 
(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready? 
This is Kimbo. 
It's off the grid entirely. 
And the answer was, "God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore." 
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling, and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic, in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza. 
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome. 
MS: That is a fantastic question. 
It will work the same either way. 
It has the same conditions as a human body, 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen. 
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses so I can actually see you, which would probably be a convenience. I don't know. 
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late. 
The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished. 
Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch, we focused it on this one element. 
You can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution. 
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights, and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily. 
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen. 
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that. 
So this is the system that I'm talking about, off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate, the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. 
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic, even at the health food market. 
You did it! You did it man! 
But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way. 
So the very same purchase, just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else. 
She is confined under the four walls of her home. 
And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide. 
And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way, and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate, then you go to -- then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... 
As you can see, they meet in 2030, I’ll be retired by then. 
And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. 
What's going on here? 
Also, more so than our credit history, we can actually shape our reputation. 
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things. 
Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano. 
Oop. (Laughs) Mental note right there. Again, we'll get back to that. 
This is the first morning I stayed with her. 
But I was interested in another definition of technology. 
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. 
(Laughter) We made mixed tapes; they remix music. 
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks, and networks are interesting only as they are big. 
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' -- reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. 
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future. 
(Laughter) Quantum tunneling takes place all the time; in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines. 
What makes something wrong? 
They're, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than females. 
What you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. 
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out. 
We believe that every lie now, every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews, your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging -- those are all different lies. They're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything's recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies. 
And the network really matters. 
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. 
Suddenly this, and suddenly that. 
There are also dipsticks, but if you look at the dipsticks, they're for another kind of urine analysis. 
I was the freak of the family. 
Some people put these two things together and they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept. 
This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory. 
Yes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big, but they can be solved. 
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine. 
In all the societies of the bottom billion, there are intense struggles to do just that. 
And if he says, "Well, what? how?" 
And if we find that thing, maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. 
Most laws are national in their implementation, despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet is borderless and international by definition. 
So all the text you're going to see is real-time generated by the computer, visualizing what he's doing with his voice. 
I mean, I am not a fashion person, believe me. 
What we do is, as we grow and we approach the collapse, a major innovation takes place and we start over again, and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on. 
So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people? 
Are there any general conclusions that arise? 
I mean, this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. 
and we have to build on that. 
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented. 
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision. 
Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see, let's -- oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies! 
Lots of complex stuff. 
And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing, physically focusing. 
That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream. 
Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this, and it's better if we think hard about it, even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. 
The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent. 
How are you going to replicate?" 
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money, now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking: Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy, to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents? 
Or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot, into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk, crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone; already there was wanting to be simpler, wanting, when they called you, never to go back. 
When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. 
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching. 
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other, including to the boring bits. 
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it. 
We did things on land, in the air, on water -- vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same, whether its land, air or water. 
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. 
And their politics are not entirely unattractive. 
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents. 
So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses, the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop. 
This was a fly by wire. It has wings. 
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. 
It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level-up. 
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. 
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about but, now, they think about it. 
So how do we do this? 
Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies. 
The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest," which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls. 
Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop -- ah, wake up! 
Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch. 
Now it's: I want to have a feeling, I need to send a text. 
The story begins in 1996 when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. 
So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something that requires you to think. 
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries, which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations. 
That's the science behind what we're doing. 
Now, like most of us, I'd been online, I'd see my house, so I thought, I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up some of these facilities. 
We don't know -- again with Tamiflu, the number one side effect of Tamiflu is flu-like symptoms. 
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive. 
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher, said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue, honor, goodness, but we no longer have a system by which to connect them." 
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?" 
And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. 
Thank you. 
Take joint positions with your client. 
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. 
So the way this works is, you have a simple system of five chemicals here, a simple system here. When they hybridize, you then form something that's different than before, it's more complex than before, and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. 
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further. 
But he never controls it. 
It's all about contradiction, which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general. 
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit, to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want, and then have our cities energized again? 
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low. 
It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city. 
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. 
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier. 
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. 
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. 
So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute, where they've done a lot of this research. 
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. 
Think about knowing that over time. 
(Applause) Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers, the larger point remains that Stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform. It's not. 
There are formal settings -- schools, colleges, hospitals -- in which innovation can take place, and informal settings -- communities, families, social networks. 
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. 
And in my 35 years of working experience, I think I was really serious four times. 
So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me, and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. 
And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. 
It's really lovely. 
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage? 
As you can see, in the United States, inflation for most of this period remained below average. 
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean, and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. 
All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves, but they need to believe that change is possible. 
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. 
♪ You are shady, you are new ♪ ♪ I'm not so good at mornings ♪ ♪ I can see too clearly ♪ ♪ I prefer the nighttime ♪ ♪ Dark and blurry ♪ ♪ Falling night ♪ ♪ Hovering light ♪ ♪ Calling night ♪ ♪ Hovering light ♪ ♪ In the moontime I will give up my life ♪ ♪ And in the deep dreams ♪ ♪ You will find me ♪ (Applause) [Excerpts from "Myth and Infrastructure"] Bruno Giussani: Come back. 
We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. 
Does something seem strange about this to you? 
Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes, so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent. 
I got into fish. 
And at that stage, we have multi-cellular communities, communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organism. 
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners, and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this, but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about." 
So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet. 
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move. 
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. 
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment. 
This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers. 
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. 
So originally I was going to go to India. 
The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none, and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults, and there are very, very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. 
Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent. 
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited. 
(Laughter) But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together. 
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon, I actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership. 
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders, the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. 
So talk about that process: deciding you'd go public with the private part, and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges. 
Can you feel their anger, their fear, their rage at what has happened in their country? 
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others. 
And this girl, when she was 17 years old, wore a burqa in Afghanistan, and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women, underneath her burqa, with a video. 
Look at Solyndra, or whatever it was. 
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. 
Paleontologists pray for erosion. 
Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King. 
If you ask neuroscientists, why is this the state of affair, they'll first of all admit it. But if you ask them, they'll say, well, there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. 
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up. 
Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. 
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. 
That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world. 
So, this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. 
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked. 
(Applause) The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me. 
And when I think about what Nathan did, and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas. 
You did not just represent yourself. 
And we put them in, and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation. 
So that is indeed what is memory. 
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable, that can become energy, that can become food, that can become fiber, that can become human beings, that can become a whole series of things, then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. 
What's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman. 
The detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty. 
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget? 
(Laughter) And he has to take it to school with him. 
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat, and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. 
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop. 
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you." 
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan." 
I can assure you there's deception there. 
Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation? 
As we became friends, I became their trustee and their medical advocate, but more importantly, I became the person who managed their end-of-life experiences. 
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week. 
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground, this may be counter-intuitive, but driving has potholes, cobblestones, pedestrians, other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with. 
I know that I am losing my grip. 
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. 
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past." 
This is the scene here. 
You don't get any money from that. 
And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. For example, the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment, were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion, and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social cohesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia. 
This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. 
What were those shows? 
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight. 
And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well they just keep going on. 
It's an objective truth about the form of two, the abstract form. 
Thank you so much for your time, and good luck with your record. (Applause) Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied. 
Task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. 
I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies, politicians will get away with gestures. 
This is coal, the most common source of electricity on the planet, and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year. 
One draws boundaries. 
In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?" 
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450, so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot, and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to 350. 
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996, convened a meeting at the White House, invited industry, human rights NGOs, trade unions, the Department of Labor, got them all in a room and said, "Look, I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. 
Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. 
It's such an honor for me. 
I understand that. 
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter). 
We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion. 
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house, sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. 
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know. 
While you're typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds, your brain is doing something amazing. 
Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work, it's depression. 
So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more. 
Medea she was, next time I saw her. 
Well the answer is, it has. 
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. 
What's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data, but when the scan finishes, they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses, you have to register the product. 
Thank you very much. 
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950. 
But we began with the idea of one child at a time. 
At five minutes to six in the afternoon, we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam, the duck comes out of the museum, and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows. 
Secondly, the idea of building community among the students. 
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else. 
Now any astronomer will tell you, this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth. 
Where was I? What was happening? 
And the big question, of course, is why? 
This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves. 
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick. 
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. 
Some people call it data science. 
And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights. 
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much -- every layperson could see that difference, and computers can be programmed to easily detect it. 
And they hate him. 
I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than 4:15. 
We need to rearrange the pattern. 
We already know where that passion is going. 
["Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse?"] Esta Soler: As we were in the process of releasing this campaign, O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend. 
Then growth gets better and better. 
All we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist, to make them part of the decision-making process and then, of course, to adapt. 
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs, you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. 
And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender. 
Well, this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. 
I study the opposite: when they remember, when they remember things that didn't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were. 
You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs, but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively. 
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. 
Thank you. (Applause) The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. 
Her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went. 
I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. 
(Laughter) But he still knows a good thing when he sees it, and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. 
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this. 
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment, but they are acting selfish and pathetic. 
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators! 
Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. 
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs -- all look like velociraptors, all named after Jane Austen characters. 
There are people who think that we should pour more money, more aid into this bowl which leaks. 
The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps. 
After this big expansion, you've seen no net increase in injuries, and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers. 
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be, including lack of access to healthcare, education, healthy foods, labor force participation. 
Now we can generalize the idea. 
Well, it's pretty simple. 
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology, but up here in the meat end of the scale. 
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters. 
Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk. 
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica. 
(Laughter) And over the course of 15 minutes, we watched through hidden cameras what happened. 
And fears and storytelling have the same components. 
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. 
But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day, and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day, and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about 40 weeks. 
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. 
So let me show you why that's wrong. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran. 
Data: I find it incredibly educational. 
Good luck having a conversation with them. 
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap. 
Even more valuable, history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual, as well as the intended consequences of ideas. 
They start with the phrase, "A friend told me," and then they end with the phrase, "Is this true?" 
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda, she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA -- Haplotype K1a1b1a -- which meant that we were distantly related. 
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon, sending home its data. 
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants, a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues, and repair damage. 
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars. 
So I bought the trailer. 
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare? 
He never seems to settle on any particular girl. 
Why would you do that? 
And the scene repeats itself so often. 
A little indulgent, I understand. 
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair." 
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love. 
Triplet-triplet. Say it with me. 
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together. 
If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the costs, you're likely to get the trade-off wrong, and your feeling doesn't match reality. 
Now these chimpanzees are using tools, and we take that as a sign of their intelligence. 
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty. 
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers -- amazing, the best in the world -- and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. 
And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector. 
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals? 
Granted, it's limited, but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it. 
Fair enough. 
(Laughter) So, a couple spreads from the book: here McLuhan says, "The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature." 
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China to open her markets. 
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light, from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance. 
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to. 
Okay, so what we've got so far is, what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls. 
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car. 
It's like hurry, build your instruments. 
As I had no reference point for my body, I began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular, their vaginas, because I thought vaginas were kind of important. 
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. 
We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development. 
So we might engage a rat, for example, to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub-skills, or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read. 
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls. 
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration. 
Let me show you some of them: Chichen Itza, Rapa Nui -- and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points -- Babylon, Rosslyn Chapel, Pompeii, and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore, which happened to be one of our most challenging projects. 
I just got this impression that the money would work. 
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book, and the chapter is on honor. 
Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart. 
For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. 
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those -- well, I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go, we're going to set up camps, and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. 
They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories, because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent. 
So, we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome, leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell, when it would have been just a contaminant. 
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. 
We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. 
Will it be safe and protected, or will it face constant dangers and threats? 
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence, or for some reason we can't take them down. 
I see now, I never was one and not the other. 
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is -- not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater -- but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days. 
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it, like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions? 
If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state, Palestinian economy. 
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. 
We had found our compromise. 
Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. 
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. 
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. 
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. 
I mean, those people lose their independence. 
It starts with a plan. 
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. 
Always that erotic murmur, I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. 
It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA. 
(Laughter) Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the bestseller list. 
(Applause) I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. 
So basically, we've used those two factors. 
There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these, 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa. 
If a female gets too many stab wounds, or if a stab wound happens to become infected, she can actually die from it. 
And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization, and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story, a new poetry, a new romanticism. 
And I didn't know what I was going to discover, so I couldn't get the funding for this. 
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped. 
It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. 
Back in the '70s, no one touched the continent with a barge pole. 
And then he saw a big wheel in midair. 
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. 
(Applause) When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me. 
So this thing right here is freaking me out. 
Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves, but they're of great use to our groups. 
That's the day I found out. 
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place, I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes, but it's a hazard of a profession. 
Somehow, people who'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought, "Oops." 
And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago I started working on this. 
And I really hated the mosquitos for that. 
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. 
CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually, for that as well. 
This is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive. 
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. 
We take the kids to Italy. 
This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. 
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. 
When the cell feels it's ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome. 
And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany. 
And when they hollow out, then they become habitats for organisms. 
Thank you. 
They're delectable muscle, rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious. 
You might know that, so far in just the dawn of this revolution, we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes, and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers, causes of cancer. 
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics -- these are cool things. 
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. 
When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced. 
This is Picasso, of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century. 
The waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height, and traveled over two miles inland. 
Well, education is a global religion. 
But moving into work -- and we have each week what's called a journal club, when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine. 
How are you going to feed the world? 
And this particular species really captured the public's attention. 
On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial in Frombork, Poland of the 16th-century astronomer who actually changed the world. 
And when one does that, one really changes the economics of delivering computational things, whether it's on the web or elsewhere. 
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about. 
So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things, so you end up with this sort of guy, right? 
We know the great lines, we know the great moments, we know what we're not going to share, and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. 
The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family. 
Woman: What solution? 
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. 
Her mother raised her alone. 
The fear is the child. 
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. 
Others think it's too much dietary fat. 
People got, in short, more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. 
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host. 
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal. 
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. 
It will be launched next September. 
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday. 
Well, I think all of you can guess that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal. 
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know doing something that's a decade ahead of their time. 
They're not going to be near another laptop, so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it. 
And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers. 
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. 
I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. 
It comforted her. 
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here. 
So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. 
I was, for all the world, the "walking guy." 
My name is Debra Brown. 
So, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel, this project also taught me an important lesson: When in doubt -- When your path is blocked, pivot. 
Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain, so everything is cross-connected? 
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions, motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. 
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear. 
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975. 
(Applause) These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses. 
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza, but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog, and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia. 
But idealism allied with pragmatism, with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit, is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong. 
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. 
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, who joined the military so she could afford college. 
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything. 
Tensions between these two families date back to 1913 when there was a dispute over local political power. 
But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. 
When I discovered that I had this gift, I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see. 
So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality. 
There's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing. 
These objects, it seemed to me, were quintessentially the kind that I and my liberal left friends in London had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the French aristocracy in the 18th century. 
Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well, and we're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation, and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain. 
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"? 
Office worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it. 
I have no more reason to blame myself. 
And, indeed, there is a better way. 
So, we really will continue to focus on products. 
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about. 
Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay. 
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go. 
Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists. 
For the past two years, 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient. 
And this is an example of this paradigm shift. 
And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise. 
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view. 
Joined with quantum mechanics, this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral, with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern. 
So, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. 
Or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position. 
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly. 
I will not kill for you. 
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system, and yet he got an idea. 
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. 
But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side? 
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. 
The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading. 
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you. 
They can't actually make them land. 
And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher, and completely exposed to the elements. 
He got part-time I.T. gigs. 
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data. 
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses. 
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age, but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident. 
This is something called funnel plot. 
This is another re-greening example. 
And do you know what, that might be enough. 
I can make my own purpose. 
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns. 
China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. 
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. 
We were no longer allowed on deck. 
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured. 
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent. 
And a more general question for our society is, what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind? 
And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery. 
You can also have function and form with public art. 
When they crashed, we crashed. 
And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. 
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick. 
And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman. 
And I told him, "I will make you a teacher." 
This is how we can start to make a protocell. 
Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years. 
And yet, it never happens. 
It could happen in learning time scales. 
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery. 
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. 
(Applause) I'm standing in front of you today in all humility, wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. 
How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us. 
There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework. 
So the call went out. 
Let me, let me push the button." 
That's a transformation, two different things. 
But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right. 
So for instance, here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life. 
So decades ago, not years ago, I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system. 
She also received the Peace Prize. 
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber. 
It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science. 
You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. 
When did we originate as a species? 
So Brownian motion, which happens to have a roughness number of two, goes around. 
can support a static load of 660 pounds. 
Our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network. 
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth. 
He was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth, when he slipped, and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell. 
Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. 
These guys are using this very successfully. 
BF: Seven-club juggling. 
By the end of the century, there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. 
And even though, for political tactical reasons, the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy, nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. 
One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria, which is where we get most of our antibiotics. 
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man. 
"Brave" has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense, courage. 
This is the main pedestrian mall; we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast. 
When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands, spinning their thoughts into the heavens. 
You see that enough in the media. 
It is more complex than this, but this will do. 
Here I got a prison assignment. 
And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines, how to take care of themselves, how to take care of their babies. 
You have made someone's life better by something that you said or that you did, and if you think you haven't, think about all the hands that didn't go back up when I asked that question. 
However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this. 
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure. 
But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside, in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance, into the interior of the auditorium. 
You can pinch into any page. 
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. 
Now Europe came as a shock to me, and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in. 
Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy. 
And his eyes opened wide and he said, "Where have I seen your face before?" 
That may not always be the case. 
When the hurricane happened, the only communication system standing was the mesh network. 
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. 
Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning -- (Laughter) 1932. 
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he's now an instructor. 
That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had until very recently. 
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top. 
But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth, if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life, he or she can do so. 
In Turkey, he's not accepted at a university, and once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter. 
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined -- according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research -- to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. 
But most importantly, we're now mapping into this anatomic framework, which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on. 
Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101. 
I mean, it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases, you're still doing these incredible new plans. 
Now, the engineering approach to this, the AI approach to this, is to build a door database. It has all the door attributes. 
And slowly, I moved out of that miserable state of mind. 
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, "Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk." 
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level, in their reading and writing in particular. 
2007 was a great year. 
But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays. 
When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded, so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube, and they're floppy when they're single-stranded. 
He actually raises money, solves my disputes. 
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart. 
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus, where there were only wild barbarians, who had never left this part of Russia. 
But she was not the only feminist in the house. 
What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend. 
On my right was the girl in question. 
And it's been slow to spread. 
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit. 
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary. 
We're facing a very powerful opponent. 
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos, and you may not like the Coca-Cola company, but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. 
Look at it here: 39 digits long, proven to be prime in 1876 by a mathematician called Lucas. 
When leaving your laboratory tomorrow, I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step, struggling to maintain their trunk. 
As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the African savanna, what distinguished us was our larger brains. 
That's how different these results are becoming. 
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. 
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers, just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet. 
That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations. 
(Laughter) So I did the thing. 
We can compute that during the game. 
They are dependent on others. 
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles. 
Now, I hope, in the coming years, that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving, among the Afghans, inside the Palestinian population, between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. 
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty. 
They got instant democracy in the 1990s: elections without checks and balances. 
They were collecting them up, and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. 
It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh. 
Okay. That's the video. Thanks. 
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. 
As we were working on this, it dawned on us: this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths, and converting it into electrons. 
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach. 
It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of, probably most of you used it coming to Doha. 
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field, as a filmmaker making films with them, where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes. 
Now, this is a bit surprising, because to the extent that we think about vision at all, we think of it as like a camera. 
Cockpit, propeller, engine. 
(Laughter) It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? 
You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement, and then the fact those men went, that the regional situation improved, that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary: the chance to be part of a new thing, a new club, a chance to join something bigger. 
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in Yankee Doodle. 
A strange phenomenon. 
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10. 
I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this. 
All different materials, all different styles, all different times, drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome. 
Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools. 
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts. 
And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it, and what it is you're going to do. How you're going to do it. 
So, it all worked out well. 
Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth? 
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day. 
HC: So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead. 
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spears? 
These are offices, which, really, in the competition, we didn't have to design. 
You don't care what it is! (Applause) You just want the person to be alive! 
Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year, maybe. 
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint. 
So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm, with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were. 
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the Earth. 
I mean, how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices? 
So we're shifting to an experience economy, where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering. 
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar. 
Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, "As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough. 
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder. 
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence -- popular support for the government. 
They're known to be man-eaters. 
In our process, we basically use it as a glue. 
Like, what could you do for a year? 
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers. 
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves. 
Basically, we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color-code the surgical field. 
(Applause) So please, if you go to Namibia, make sure that you stay in the tents. 
What about causality? 
It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti. 
Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history, medications and physician information. 
As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes, ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes, indoor models, outdoor models, everything, which I just thought was a lot of fun, and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them. 
They group together, they form institutions. 
There are all other sorts of applications, merging your phone and diagnostics, for example -- measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that, potentially, to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic. 
Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. 
SW: Yeah. 
To be one of them? 
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone, because you seem to be doing a lot better when you’re not saying anything." 
These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no. 
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make, and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves. 
And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard. 
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera. 
You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together. 
It is very useful in certain circumstances. 
Ladies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words. 
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. 
On the left, we have Pia. 
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away." 
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people, but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. 
And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. 
Quantum biology is still in it infancy. 
Well, it was published two days before Christmas, downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right? 
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power, and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. 
Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names. 
Run away. Run. 
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day. 
And it enters now another story. 
Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook, and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated, meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. 
Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee. 
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was. 
And the only acceptable answer is -- (Audience: Yes.) -- yes. 
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion. 
That is me playing my imaginary piano. 
Media, the media landscape that we knew, as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs, is increasingly slipping away. 
Astronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van to go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader. 
And probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark, but there's still the light above, bright above. 
I learned so much about myself. 
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. 
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate, and if we coupled these now to inheritable information, we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve. 
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial. 
Thank you. 
Unfortunately, it would be extremely expensive. 
And I think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction. 
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them. 
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere? 
And that's the story with climate-change heating. 
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed. 
And the mother goes right through a red light. 
So I went back that very summer. 
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives to single-use plastics. 
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. 
Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred. 
We need people who want to do the right thing. 
So therefore, we get a lot of complaints every single week -- complaints including one we get very often, which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage," celebrates the idea of vivisection. 
So let's do something a little bit harder. 
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way. 
No one is left behind. 
Patients are such an underutilized resource. 
RP: So that's speech synthesis. 
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, "You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself." 
Albert hands me the knife. 
As the length of the construction takes years, workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building. 
Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival is not an imported festival, but rather an important festival between the cities of New York and Doha. 
We can do it. The technical solutions are there. 
And the answer is zero. 
But what I want to get to, the next frontier, very quickly, and why the stethoscope is on its way out, is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds, and the breath sounds, because now, introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound. 
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried. 
They just sang the cool new west coast song. 
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin. 
Now David is my literary agent. 
We're inside the Pike Place Market. 
And it is an arresting fact that right across the board, in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion -- the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening -- is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine." 
And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment, and then she started getting tears in her eyes. 
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck. 
And I looked up and said, "Who is that man?" 
So one of the principle applications for this material is, amongst other things, in baby bottles, so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink. 
If you did this, more people would save more. 
The extreme might be in Italy where, again, there's kind of some type of control over what's happening in the environment is very evident, even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals. 
And so thinking back, I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects. 
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research. 
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. 
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. 
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain on a chip. 
The pack stays together. 
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray. 
Would you eat this? 
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog, she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and she spoke from every platform she could. 
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this? 
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. 
It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual. 
It's like the air. 
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this. 
So now, Mahabuba, she is saving the lives of hundreds, thousands, of women. 
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people. 
Millions were suffering, but few spoke, and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog, and you speak for your rights. 
When I posted this secret, dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones, sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years, messages from family or friends who had died. 
But my spirit is strong as ever. 
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes. 
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right. 
As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers. 
There you go. That's connection. 
So this is Turbo. 
And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do. 
So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing, and as they do so they create an electrical charge. 
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results, means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old. 
They have great explanatory power. 
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism. 
The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter. 
And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. 
When you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like? 
And that's BumpTop. Thanks! 
That's the way the system works. 
We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems. 
This is a SOLE in Newcastle. 
You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. 
And it's very, very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough, or worse, that all we're doing is contributing to landfill. 
E: Happy birthday to you. 
Well in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it." 
But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. 
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. 
You know, bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. 
Thank you. 
Which brings up a critical question: Why is this time different, if it really is? 
So let me sum up. 
And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. 
So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer? 
So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in. 
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project, I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter) And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. 
Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. 
And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks. 
My father worked as a policeman in the city. 
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. 
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. 
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties. 
The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space, compromised as it may be, is still a really great thing. 
Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. 
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons. 
So we saw this and we thought, can there be a better way? 
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. 
The budget is not always there. 
He said, "I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny." 
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries, and since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events. 
Of course, it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. 
Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world and together we raised 77 million dollars. 
Silent. We don't have a track for it yet. 
By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL, and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet. 
And this cumulative cultural adaptation, as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas, is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives. 
The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. 
They assumed two percent, and that made it a pretty hopeless story, because population growth was two and a half. 
I'm very interested in Mars, of course, and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars. 
It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. 
Now, this is funny for me: to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel, because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people, Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person. 
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision, a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical. 
So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin, and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper. 
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx. 
Many of the German companies, for instance, believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price, so they are very competitive. 
I assure you, that's not the case. 
(Laughter) But here's the deal. 
This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, for which humans have no natural immunity. 
The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. 
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice. 
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here." 
Little by little, that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed from a rather dry, academic register of place names into living, breathing entities. 
Second is technical assistance. 
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget. 
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service. 
I was really happy when I was done. 
And they don't react to background sounds. 
And to put that in perspective, the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars. 
And that's been called the face area in the brain, because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces. 
When identity politics tries to put labels on us, it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. 
Court: Never. 
They're also made up of three different sizes, as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain. 
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"] So that's a pretty strong comment there. 
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, "I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. 
My father answered it, and the soldiers ordered us out of our home. 
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people, "Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing." 
That was the family business. 
So we record all these examples, the data, and then we go through a sequence of steps. 
On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago. 
So, patients have this. We're for patients. 
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch. 
But for real change, we need feminine energy in the management of the world. 
I mean -- you've got to be confident; if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it? 
(Applause) I know what you're thinking. 
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine. 
You have it wrong. You've missed it. 
Now the raw material of it, of course, is just the music of everyday life. 
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment, where government really wants to make your life miserable. 
People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you, and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used, especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study, their reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy." 
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world. 
I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle." 
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. 
He was treated with radiation therapy, state-of-the-art radiation therapy, but it didn't help. 
(Laughter) "You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars." 
These rabbits were bred at a government facility, Biosecurity Queensland, where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them. 
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. 
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market. 
The animal had virtually no control over the legs. 
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look. 
This market's crazy, everybody. 
And every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals. 
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year, and Turkey with seven percent per year. 
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. 
New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk. 
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return." 
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these. 
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire. 
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos -- are the emcees of the animal kingdom. 
But think again. Why should that be always the case? 
And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time? 
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth. 
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. 
And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month. 
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two, and then I'd like to begin testing them, first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects. 
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format, so it's much bigger. 
That's still about us, and if we carry on thinking about us, we are in deep, deep trouble. 
It will happen. 
We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona. 
So I don't know how much this is helping me, but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off. 
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers, and I myself, I'm not going to give you many answers today, just ask a lot of questions. 
And across a whole range of fields -- from software, astronomy, natural sciences, vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing, so on and so forth -- you find people who want to do things because they love it, but they want to do these things to very high standards. 
Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. 
Statically, China is a one-party system, authoritarian -- there's no question about it. 
So after the tragic incident, Mark, you decided to resign your position as an astronaut, even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. 
He employed 200 people. 
What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data? 
Out of four British people, three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families. 
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard, in that it has become, it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the 20th century. 
(Laughter) "It's going to transform your organization. I don't want to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here, met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom, and I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization." 
The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be. 
And we believe that together, we can help to take care of our Spaceship Earth. 
It's growing every day. 
And over and over again, as I interviewed them and spent my days with them, I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. 
Back when I was your age, we didn't know what the universe was going to do. 
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms. 
Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers. 
And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together. 
If I show another aspect of that technology then, in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland. 
Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror. 
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. 
They didn't know what couldn't be done. 
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music. 
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. 
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India. 
But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. 
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek. 
Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. 
And the point really is, is that I think, probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening. 
Nobody tells anybody what to do. 
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. 
And I'm a very small part of this. 
Now in the old days, conducting, music making, was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion. 
We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well, to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did 50 years ago, based on instinct and experience, and make it into one that runs on data and analytics. 
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. 
And I realized, of course, this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large. 
So it allows it to roll. 
PR: Exactly. And it -- but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time. 
(Laughter) It's axiomatic that they're dodgy, and they're going to want to try and rip you off. 
The sun rises, and it melts away. 
So here's to another day at the office. 
Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. 
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative. 
Well, at least, we did once. 
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet, and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs, the death of these beautiful ammonites, Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here, and so much else. 
And so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers, the first being violence interruptors. 
And I understood, this was their election, and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them. 
EC: Beatbox started here in New York. 
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36, trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. 
And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species. 
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. 
Whenever there is an election, it seems like something always goes wrong, someone tries to cheat, or something goes accidentally awry -- a ballot box goes missing here, chads are left hanging over here. 
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." 
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them, and in this case, the trickle-down effect, which does not work in economics, works perfectly. 
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. 
You see a filament, you see the light is the invisible matter, and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up. 
(Applause) And let me say this without a trace of irony -- before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies. 
Christopher Poole: When I was 15, I found this website called Futaba Channel. 
Now most of the time, I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients, but some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients. 
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them. 
It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic. 
The point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer, in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings, but with the same words. 
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant. 
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. 
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time. 
Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. 
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you? 
Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act, and nine months of gestation, and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor is merely execution. 
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. 
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming? 
We look at these pictures and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain. 
And I hope instead that you, my lovely young gentlemen, will one day help make it beautiful. 
They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go, to try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access to a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances, so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach to my peers. 
And this is what I said. 
And everything will go through the Web. 
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. 
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. 
One of them is pattern recognition. 
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers, to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources. 
Privacy is not up for discussion. 
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. 
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting, subconsciously, except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion. 
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan, and we looked at Senegal. 
You're here to change lives. 
I had opportunity to go all over, where herbarium for my African material is. 
Perhaps it was the crutches, but it seemed -- (Laughter) -- it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. 
And then when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?" 
Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said, "Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September, we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end -- just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. 
I believe in your hopes and your dreams, I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm. 
(Laughter) I mean, I've heard about that. 
The real trouble comes when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators, when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty. 
Interestingly enough, an example: One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school, we said, "We need to have you retake the course, because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level." 
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example? 
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm. 
And their aspiration was to buy a car. 
There's no problems. 
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors. 
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism. 
Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati, President Anote Tong. 
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this. 
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar, Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on, and now Tunisia and Egypt. 
And now it's in there somewhere. 
What you see is it takes steps backwards, it tries to counter-balance, it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. 
Of course, there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God. 
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America, which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools, and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city. 
So, if you sort of compare that, like this, you'll see that computer versus human -- I've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed. 
This is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code -- this is what they're talking about. 
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. 
The world population has doubled since I went to school. 
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self. 
So the first example I'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments. 
Herself fall. 
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule. 
If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -- we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral. 
This is from the first two seconds. 
So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food, energy and water and waste all within one building. 
I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative. 
JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. 
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power. 
Those are real and they're in my building every day. 
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers. 
And this is what changed. 
It is very powerful. It is very exciting. 
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running, everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing at the starting line, just waving, because she didn't know she was supposed to run. 
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly"? 
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. 
(Laughter) And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way." 
Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures. 
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains. 
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world." 
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice. 
Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most. 
Look at this diagram, which is showing warm waters in red, cool waters in blue, and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green, is the growth of vegetation, and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation. 
People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it. 
Now recently, there's been development in this field. 
How do we produce global public goods, which are good for us, but good for everyone at the same time? 
The problem is they're just too expensive, tens of thousands of dollars. 
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time. 
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. 
And that is what Nick did, up to a point. 
And they can handle water. 
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels. 
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here. 
Remember that excitement? 
So there's no stigma. 
So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom. 
My kids love this stuff. 
♫ From Bronx to Berlin, we took the tour European ♫ ♫ All vocal yeah, we widit, call the album "What is it?" ♫ ♫ With Sarah Connor, set the goal for number one and we hit it ♫ ♫ But now it's Kev, Sim, Drew, Stew, time for a new day ♫ ♫ Ring the alarm, hit 'em on Skype or a two-way ♫ ♫ Sung by the words, we ready to fly! ♫ ♫ Fly baby! Time to leave that nest ♫ ♫ Fly baby! This ain't no time to rest ♫ ♫ Come on fly baby, we got work to do ♫ 
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation. 
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey. 
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment. 
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. 
Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works. 
This led to a program, which we call TACARE. 
We've got all of that. 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 
But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. 
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop. 
(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
And at that time, stem cell research had gained momentum, following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s. 
If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late, you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics, yet the phenomenon is transnational. 
But the key one really is the encoder alone, because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer. 
Tamara, are you recording? 
I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply, why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody. 
I mean, it's just a losing proposition. 
It makes content get better, it makes searching work better, when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. 
And on then into the social sciences, where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority. 
Obviously experimentation is very important. 
And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. 
Often, these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna, in this case, grazing tortoises. 
So I sent this company an email saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. 
Changing into a totally different field, we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics, particularly in an area called metamaterials. 
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? 
She risks a lot and she's terrified. 
So I thought that would be good to end with. 
Either way, mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us. 
The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. 
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. 
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel, opposite directions, near the speed of light. 
So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. 
If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover, like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle. 
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. 
There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata. 
I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged.

And I sat down, she sat on my lap. 
Over 100,000 children learn science this way. 
So I quit my day job as a nurse. 
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil, and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it. 
Did you know that about her? 
They tried the usual psychotherapy. 
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge, and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge? 
So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer. 
Well, first of all, start out. None of these big, long-titled slides with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and I'm presenting to so-and-so, such-and-such a date. 
Her future husband, Jeff, was working for Canon cameras, and met Natasha at the Olympic Village. 
Your body doesn't like the saltwater. 
So they asked them at the beginning, "Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?" 
So, I hopefully am writing, you know, books that are good for children and for adults. 
And we have to realize that we are all going to into this, down to here. 
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. 
It's about 50 or so years off track. 
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? 
Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave, and I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great! 
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons? 
Trigger-pullers go this way. 
She's not amused. Let's think about it. 
And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore. 
And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet. 
So far so good? 
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. 
Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer, who told me this about 35 years ago, when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine. 
They spread across Africa also, of course, and there were older, earlier forms of humans there. 
We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. 
Thanks very much. 
Okay, when you hear the click, this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom. 
I don't want to explain these things. 
And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts, who started walking towards her. 
There are a lot of farmers doing this today. 
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫ ♫ and list while I sing, ♫ ♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫ BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫ ♫ my age it means less, ♫ ♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫ KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it, then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song. 
By the time I came to the office, of course my trainers were gone. 
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms. 
And what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth. 
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue. 
That is the meat, the problem. 
And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap. 
A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -- the cost of loss of topsoil, the cost of loss of waterways, the lost productivity, the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors, desertification and so on -- those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. 
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday. 
He was shaking, panicking. 
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. 
And then the cell splits down the middle. 
The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S. 
Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad. 
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA: What did you write to your family? 
Except there is a slight tether here, which keeps it from going over the top of its field. 
But he did his best, and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine. 
(Laughter) Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK, but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable but it would be ugly." 
And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact. 
So we brought in Flip cams, and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages, their thoughts. 
She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. 
But design -- oh, my God. 
Get on up! Come on, stretch! 
Day after day, when I listened to the news, when I followed what was going on with my country, my heart was breaking up. 
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter) He wanted to make it too difficult to copy, and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time. 
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. 
And today, cyclists look like New York City looks. 
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt. Everest. 
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things, and they are enormously less happy when they do that, our worries, our anxieties, our regrets, and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral, they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind-wandering at all. 
And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. 
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask, I wouldn't ask -- they would. 
It's something like life, that once you get in it you can't get out. 
My grandmother had depression. 
These laptops, when a child opens them up, they communicate with every single child in the classroom, within that school, within that village. 
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. 
And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation. 
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable. 
These tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. 
So I wanted to show you a clip, and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together. 
Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries, in many cultures. 
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate, even though they don't know anything about urban planning: To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. 
Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think? 
In that moment in time, Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation, a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims, the most vulnerable of all, were women and children. 
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. 
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. 
But what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time, as a nine-year-old child -- was that they stopped at all. 
(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago. 
You can sort of have it all with these things. 
Be prepared to be good neighbors. 
There is a huge amount of gas to be saved, about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. 
And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans -- and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... 
So what we added is a second element to our network, which is a battery swap system. 
Are you more than your genes? 
Sadly, this ideology still functions very well, which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty. 
And one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter) But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important. 
We need to stop that, to stop pretending to be omniscient beings. 
If you want the really big numbers, look at these numbers for heart disease. 
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies, hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination, and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. 
That includes cottages and the like. But 30 percent. 
In the sorts of countries I work in, that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent. 
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. 
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in? 
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation. 
Your aorta comes up behind your heart. 
You're not threatening us or bribing us, suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. 
And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. 
And as a chemist, we're not used to profound questions every day. 
And there's only data where there is light. 
They're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along. 
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology. 
And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone, Internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they're simple, the functions are simple, and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. 
Thank you. 
(Laughter) The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break. 
How one moment -- it was disgusting -- journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me, saying my work was wonderful, and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me. 
And I had a happy brush with convergence until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing. 
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. 
This was Bert the Turtle. (Video) This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war, then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. 
The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example, is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. 
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in, found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains, so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest. 
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year, westwardly. 
And so one of the things we think about a lot is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body. 
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. 
The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience. 
But we've worked through some of those, but we've still got real problems in Washington. 
(Laughter) But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world? 
And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course, but it was a very high-risk proposition. 
We have the same problems; we can just go in the streets. 
PM: I have a feeling we might see that picture next, Gabby. 
It would mean that, even before birth, mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there, telling them, "Be careful." 
(Dolphins noises) Now, these are bottlenose dolphins, and you'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds. 
And on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation. 
Let me bring it to you locally. 
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin. 
The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light, and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. 
Our farming has done the opposite. 
But what about you? What's it going to do to you? 
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around, it might look to you, right? 
You're probably asking that. Why should you care? 
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm. 
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. 
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. 
And that's transmitted back to land immediately. 
They get influenced by things that they're not aware of. 
So we're trying to do that. 
And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences. 
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged. 
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad, with Exxon. 
We have families that self-destruct, friends that betray us. 
But come the day, he would always skip that loose step, he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat. 
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect, this lighting effect, which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. 
Richard Searfoss: Good luck. 
[Neurogenesis] Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now -- that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells. 
(Laughter) This is a moose. 
Nothing. 
He has her wear very plain clothes. 
So, my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick. 
And she's right. Every time you go there, you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go? 
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great. 
And it's that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things, but also the dark and difficult things. 
And so that's what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table. 
It is a haiku, if you will, of the story. 
They like Social Security. They like Medicare. 
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out. 
Every single surface of this restaurant is white. 
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that. 
"Travels the world." (Laughs) "I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..." 
I was just saying, we have a lot of people on the call we'd like to get through, so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. 
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium. 
But not when they're together like that. 
One was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn't like school, couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs. 
Over the 15 years before the financial crisis, the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before. 
So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. 
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. 
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman, in a way that no one else ever had. 
Something like a billion people depend on fish, the quantity of fish in the oceans. 
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved? 
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win." 
That's kind of like what we're at. 
And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. 
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project. 
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience. 
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. 
Myself, I will go back to the East. 
What about Seoul? Seoul, because of broadcast rights, all the games have been in the late afternoon. Sun has already been set, so the games have been perceived as comfortable. 
And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. 
That's a heat engine. 
And all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder. 
In fact, neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior, things like paranoia, delusions and hallucinations, these are patternicities. 
Please understand the problem of poor people. 
In the late 1990s, a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space. 
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. 
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel, you'll see very black smoke. 
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation, then indeed you get, from the same theory, a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely. 
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote. 
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. 
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent. 
And I really spend a lot of time wondering, how much truth do we tell? 
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept. 
I don't think we can get away from those changes. 
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now. 
And when I became editor-in-chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999, and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it. 
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this. 
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. 
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty, is what Yochai has said already -- is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. 
And my father, in a low voice, muttering, "I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do. 
And though the equation is largely subjective, you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence, but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify. 
When I started in this field, we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000, a very rare condition. 
My mind works like Google for images. 
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. 
There are three important reasons. 
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen. 
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. 
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart. 
In the old days of the silent movies -- Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable. 
And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution, a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again, and to realize the economic potential of that, and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant. 
And for that, the audience -- the lovely, beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after. 
WAIS Divide itself though, is a circle of tents in the snow. 
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction, you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income. 
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox, for example. 
Engineers, economists, classical economists all had a very, very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung. 
You think that's not an issue going forward? 
And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT, one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius. 
NA: Well, let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl. 
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times, but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with. 
Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips, and may not have that opportunity, except for us. 
Now, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more. 
It absolutely means something more. 
(Music) (Laughter) (Music) Hey. 
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. 
When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide, and I really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon. 
And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher. 
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't. 
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that, and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it." 
It was that hands-on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures. 
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers, however, because they do face a range of other human-induced threats. 
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. 
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know? 
It was, academically, quite a challenging project, and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. 
And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision, its playfulness, its innovation and its promise of imminent violence. 
But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet. 
So, lava-tube caves-- I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. 
George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility, or their stability, you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. 
Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies, track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none. 
It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her. 
But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis. 
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout, and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. 
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. 
Now, I want to get back to that compiler. 
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know, fun things we are doing on Mars. 
It has a more transparent identity. 
So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do, many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it, the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future? 
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953. 
So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit. 
So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster. 
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower, except that like almost all whistle-blowers, he wasn't a crank at all, he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. 
So we turn to the field of vaccines. 
Not a joke. 
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. 
And apparently it was quite popular. 
But who was the better man, old mate? 
When we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things. 
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century, and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. 
The issue is, at that price, can you give them some extra value? 
(Applause) When the Industrial Revolution started, the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil, and this carbon powered the Industrial Revolution, it put the "Great" in Great Britain, and led to Britain's temporary world domination. 
You're the guy that makes eye candy." 
I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. 
And the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today, the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle. 
What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote? 
And I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing I can communicate is very, very basic. 
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. 
Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property. 
When we think about why we hear, we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren, although clearly that's an important thing. 
We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. 
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips. 
Every time you do things on the social networking site, the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it -- and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site. 
In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play. 
And then in the same time period, you know, we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. 
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her? 
And about that time, I got on the scales. 
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. 
We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that's a hundred million barrels a day. 
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range, you go into disease or death. 
A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron. 
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen. 
I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us. 
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit -- very important. 
The Americans, they're rich. 
You should hear some of the phone conversations that I have with people on my Bluetooth in the shop. 
They need a low deductible, and 24-hour roadside assistance. 
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime. 
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose. 
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us. 
(Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. 
You wonder, are these things random chance? 
But when you take a close look, you start to see the holes, and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. 
We all know that it's Bill. 
Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years. 
He lives in this log cabin -- no running water, no heat other than -- no windows and high-speed Internet connection. 
Yeah. 
(Laughter) If you then wanted to connect to another city, let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi, you'd have to book something called a trunk call, and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through. 
We're missing California from American English. 
When someone is more likely to remember, we can give them a nugget in a window. 
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap, because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter) We never put it together, you know? 
We run today the world's largest handwashing program by any public health standards. 
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle. 
And also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison, and also, of course, critical habitat for another whole range of other species. 
(Applause) I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise. 
The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. 
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. 
Adult stem cells are throughout our body, including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow, which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years. 
(Laughter) Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. 
And we can walk through the reasons for that, but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from, whereas the larger, faster-growing cell takes only two days. 
You know, hundreds of people came in begging, all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it. 
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know. 
It was [unclear] high school. 
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside. 
And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy. 
And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air, like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk, and the news reader was like, "This has never happened before. What do we do?" 
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. 
"I was handsome," he said. 
We're flying across the caldera floor. 
Then when my dad sees that, he'll be very proud. 
By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you. 
And, you know, how many widgets are you going to sell? 
This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. 
(Applause) I'd like to take you to another world. 
Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. 
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website. 
There's a finite region of space that we have access to, surrounded by a horizon. 
This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea, and there's a bus route that runs through it, lots of people out on the street. 
And if you compare light energy to musical scales, it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see, which is right in the middle? 
Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week, and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom. 
Their main goal here, like my teenagers, is to eat and grow. 
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. 
But of course, then the ball hits the other side, the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet. 
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter, exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry, who finds other quarries along the way. 
That's peer-to-peer. 
This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected. 
"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay? 
OK, about a -- two dozen. 
So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain. 
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. 
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack. 
(Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does? 
(Applause) So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema. 
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.

And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension, you've got a little wet rag. 
For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself. 
So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. 
And I decided, it was an old dream that was lingering, that was from so many years ago, three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from Cuba to Florida. 
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea, and we said, "What can we do with this? 
I would give my viewpoints to people.

I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys. 
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book -- you can see it being typed up above. 
So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system.

It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. 
Now, I've got an example here from Canada. 
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.

But there it is. The gay agenda. 
As the frequencies increase, so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate. 
Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns, they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before, and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people, relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit — (Laughter) — and one huge and important difference: purpose.

A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article. 
Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry. 
Are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off, as a famine? 
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. 
And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. 
And so I was always asking this question: "Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?" 
And we're going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city. 
Landscaping. 
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years? 
Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world. 
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed." 
(Laughter) Now, this is important, because remember, when the moment the student stood up, it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating, because the experimenter said, "You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money. 
In here you see a traditional 2D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation, and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs. 
He has a purpose in life. 
(Applause) I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.

And while, of course, we do need clean energy, I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem, we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it. 
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating. 
And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO, who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders, but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives.

Our car was stoned at one point. 
(Applause) We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is, what gives happiness -- or happiness, which I equate with joy in my particular area, and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing 
The more you will rise, to see far and high, like that, the more you will be important for the story of our mutation. 
And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year. 
And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.

Maybe there's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. 
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms, just for the Carnival and the Knife. 
That's all we know." 
And could we even, thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science, identify the thresholds, the points where we may expect nonlinear change? 
And so every time a new medium arrives, the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable, highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium, and it is ignored. 
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. 
We often focus on one disease, one model, one problem, but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us. 
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. 
I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think, of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him, it's a way of working with him, with his government. 
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning, the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note, because it smells of something green, like cut grass. 
They're far closer together than that." 
This is an exciting new venture. 
And I'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made. 
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems. 
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria, and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare." 
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him? 
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it, because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. 
And so, when you start to look at emergent systems, you can look at a neuron under a microscope. 
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No. 
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela. 
And the most cohesive hives won, just as Darwin said. 
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days, and people feel that, for whatever reason, it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. 
That's reason number one. And reason number two: it's much easier for the camera guy to film If I'm using smoke. 
And Bandura calls that confidence self-efficacy -- the sense that you can change the world and that you can attain what you set out to do. 
So we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes, how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation.

RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know, televisions are the future, not computers. 
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed. 
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually. 
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem. 
We did it just like that. 
And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy." 
Now, I don't know how that happened, and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you. 
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?

They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them. 
A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

With all this information and support, I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons, traditional doctors, oncologists, and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving, which is very important. 
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. 
(Applause) Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories, but you're really writing about the exceptions." 
We need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved. 
So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA. 
(Laughter) "I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter) Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

And we can look at cells directly. 
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet. 
You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere, and all those rotations leave the sphere alone.

Live life. Thank you. 
They called me.

Now take this together and you end up with 2.3 million words of TEDTalks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content. 
And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- (Laughter) -- try to bring my family together with laughter. 
And everything began pretty auspiciously. 
And so it will be quite a different shape. 
I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization. 
Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening.

Now, the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet, that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive. 
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens. 
And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. 
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air. 
The question is even if -- are there enough serious injuries to make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky. 
No had never been an option. 
This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions, so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. 
You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. 
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one. 
How does it really work? It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless, metaphorically speaking. 
Baby: Yeah. 
Couldn't find it. 
(Applause) And so, what I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place. 
So these things together give us evolution, perhaps. 
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind, in the way that, in fact, no two of us are quite alike. 
It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy, vibrating in different frequencies. 
You see this ampoule. You see this one. 
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like -- (Laughter) -- it's a good point. 
And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics, we'll have a window on the way the disease works, and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on. 
Again, please pick a percentage. 
Well I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so I'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator. 
It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go. 
But that only blew out 500 million. 
(Laughter) Sure, if we get it wrong, we could face the end of this civilization, but if we get it right, it could be the beginning of civilization instead. 
We were making what was invisible visible. 
Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself, and much more quickly than people had once realized, if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem. 
And when I saw this, first an image and then visited, it completely changed the way I thought after that point. 
There's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it. 
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle. 
There's not a simple answer. 
Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories: childhood, summertime, even other TED Talks. 
So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male, you take away all the social power he has. 
A nuclear explosion is just as hot, but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid, or vaporize it, would be more like it. 
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans. 
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains. 
My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time. 
And that was only the beginning. 
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves. 
And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for. 
We still don't know yet how important it is; this is still an open question. 
We're in Ramallah right now. 
Please give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork. 
If we can pull this off, if we can build more function, it will be stackable. 
It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. 
CA: And it still didn't work? 
Now there's no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. 
So this is a patient of mine called John. 
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task, when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. 
To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal budget. 
But that's not electricity yet. 
And, you know, I look at this, and I get really emotional. 
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item. 
And that is very useful information. 
And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics. 
They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram. 
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive. 
It's literally the definition of noise. 
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. 
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. 
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. 
When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that. 
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two. 
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games, is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. 
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa; we're not really talking about African narratives. 
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. 
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes. 
Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. 
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society. 
He thought I was mad enough anyway. 
And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people, and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren, it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure, if you reach back and help, if you mentor, if you invest in boys and girls clubs, if you work with your school system, make sure it's the best school system, and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem, not just downtown Montessori on the West Side. 
Let's go back to the same three areas. 
Now I just want to wrap up, and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested, but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language, and the potential power of being able to do that. 
And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. 
His favorite novel was "The [Unknown] Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac, and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself. 
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal. 
The other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular, or something like that, never having actually gotten physical access to your car. 
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future. 
Arm amputation causes a huge disability. 
(Applause) Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about 100 years ago. 
I mean, how nice is that? 
There's never been a time like this. 
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all." 
It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK? 
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to congregations about compassion, I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter) Now -- but that's not the whole story. 
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay, and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor. 
Okay, all right, great. Thanks. 
And so, subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences, interviews, talking and using my platform as a musician, with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous, unbelievable work that he had done. 
But why do they do this? 
So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. 
You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. 
In China, the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters. 
Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug? 
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English." 
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans, looking for a mate. 
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters, which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. 
You might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that. 
Okay. Let's zoom out again. 
So this takes care of my age. 
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad." 
So, one time, I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed, and I was watching a television show. 
So let's do that. 
The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. 
It's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot, but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. 
It's called "Talk to Me." 
Now a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly? 
One of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate. 
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do: it takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages. 
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions. 
And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems. 
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones, and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic. 
But before doing that, I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know: that our genomes, our genetic material, are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA, which is this famous double-helical molecule. 
But it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore. 
It means being able to send your children to school, go to university, or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. 
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this? 
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area. 
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development. 
Then they give you 10 minutes. 
So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays. 
This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. 
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages. 
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region. 
(Laughter) Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous, but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex, it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. 
So, I have now showed you three projects, and you might ask yourself, what is it good for? 
Now, when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say, "Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil. 
And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually measure effectiveness? Are we effective? 
Because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma, the resolution of which, it's fair to say, would determine not only the future course of our psychology, but the future course of the entire world. 
(Applause) In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields. 
(Applause) PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet. 
And he will push us back. 
The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. 
I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you. 
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages. 
They've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in. 
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction. 
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current. 
When Ram dies, Krishna is born. 
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition. 
We have the medicines, we have the tests, but how do you reduce the stigma? 
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University. 
(Laughter) Men only. 
They want to take over from us. 
You have lights in an aircraft. 
And so we need both the market and we need aid. 
Okay, look at that. It's a darkslide. 
Now, we did what we knew, how we had grown up, and one of the things that we knew, that was in our DNA, was secrecy. 
And I don't have much time. 
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. 
The content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media. 
The solution becomes self-sustaining. 
The doctors, it seemed, never really had enough time for all the patients, try as they might. 
This is the site. 
But this was progress -- you know, give them credit. And now today, we've seen more progress. I think -- I hope -- most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings, deserve to be treated decently, unless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion. 
She lived in New York. 
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up? 
That thinking has led to, I think, much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business, that I come to criticize in business. 
CA: Have you met anyone interesting? 
And you might think it's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit, but it's also good economic sense, because they're saving a million dollars a year. 
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us. 
And in that moment, there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. 
So what they did was they asked us an important question. 
Ten of diamonds. 
It's one of the things that we don't like to think about, but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true. 
And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there, because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation. 
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.' Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps." 
It's not a matter of calculation. 
And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there. 
We overlay them. This is actual data. 
It doesn't work that way. 
Jansky had made a historic discovery, that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. 
They've made a selection. 
There are emotions of the victims. 
And I remember, Natasha didn't want us opening the door -- sorry, I was trying not to open the door, because we'd spent so much time barricading the room. 
It's not a free gift. 
We don't know what that's going to do to you, not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term. 
This was something more than that. He ignored it. 
He was simply the instrument of God's will. 
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it. 
So we should get started now. 
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through. 
And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course -- it's available now, online, free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions, at universities in China, in India, in Africa, around the world, to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate. 
Because she believed that the only way to unblock what, at the time, was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle. 
This implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth. 
This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. 
Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men. 
Now, your task now is to decide which review is fake? 
I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars. 
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game. 
The psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?" 
This is but one: this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi. 
Psychologists studied behavior objectively, neuroscientists studied the brain objectively, and nobody even mentioned consciousness. 
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip, and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors. 
So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy, but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights, the two different towers, the first responders, and you can actually see within that different floors, and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves. 
And he had never appeared in public since that point. 
We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia, where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission, but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. 
The pyramid of ocean life ... 
We can't. What's great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time. 
So, without this technology you can't see the stars. 
Because see, I have these new nuclear submarines that I'm building. 
And whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property. 
And the sum looks like this. 
And I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this." 
Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change, because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project. 
I said, "Well, what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. 
It involves limited raw materials. 
We added in more sugar. 
Obviously opening up the data is one, but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities. 
And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners: Europeans, North Americans, Australasians. 
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. 
And it was right-heart failure. 
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion. 
And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. 
So let me come back, with this sense of hope, to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. 
Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage. 
So in other words, regret requires two things. 
If she can't talk when she gets to the shore, she's gonna be pissed off." 
Each card box is one billion people. 
Thank you. 
I mean, it just gives you the scale. 
Space and time, as you perceive them right now, are your desktop. 
And they're doing what they think is best. 
And I think by pulling these things together, if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these, we're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick. 
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man. 
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. 
And, basically, none of them could solve it. 
It's also genetics. 
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher. 
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great. 
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. 
They want to be missed. 
We worked with mothers and children. 
A government dependent upon the people alone. 
My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router, so that everyone here understands — (Laughter) — but nonetheless, here is the device. 
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen. 
Take the bread. Take it home. 
Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space is filled with sand, and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon. 
All of us, to some extent, study this thing called a Bill Gates. 
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments. 
As an intentional murderer, Anders Breivik is merely evil. 
I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book, Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty. 
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. 
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. 
So what can we do about this? 
So, "Honey, come here, let's get your picture with the black guy." 
Thank you. 
It says a lot about her peers who elected her. 
They back then, actually, made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto. 
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties – its chemistry, or its size. 
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now." 
But to her, it mattered deeply. 
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. 
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome. 
I even did it when I was Secretary of State. 
Installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes, who's the head of the Novaes family, are these turret holes, which were used for shooting and looking. 
What gives us the courage? 
But basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you. 
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200. 
I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example. 
Scraps of men do not exist. 
Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights. 
Okay, India. 
Yet again, the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day. 
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic. 
(Aquatic noises) So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo, about 60 feet below the surface. 
What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology? 
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. 
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. 
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet, so I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed, there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. 
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. 
And the inconsistencies create, fundamentally, this last mile problem. 
They had come from thousands of miles away. 
Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost. 
The hate mail I get is unbelievable. 
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games. 
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. 
But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years, there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from, buying the government out from under us. 
Big idea, but I think highly defensible. 
I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question, that this is not the important question. 
One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses, to sort of something that is very key to the economy. 
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about. 
You need a pressure suit. 
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. 
We did a whole issue on it. 
But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant. 
Why do we want to protect your home? 
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well, that there's nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that -- but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five. 
In those situations, we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided. 
So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. 
I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry. 
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher. 
There you go. 
They don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside. 
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine. 
So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights. 
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden. 
These are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways. 
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 -- as well as flu B viruses. 
And it was very sad for me, because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. 
Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot. 
I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed. 
Well, that's because they're all young. 
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. 
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice. 
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. 
I would caddy, I would go to the golf course and caddy for people. 
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving, the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg, but without the brain. 
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. 
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know. 
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages. 
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ... 
Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things, and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things, comparisons become important. 
It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches. 
It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. 
So they built the blade of light, and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's -- probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is, with cables that are out on the side. 
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction. 
So if you lose that precious resource, where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries, that's a huge waste. 
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. 
The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity. 
OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes. 
That's a man heart attack. 
What does this all mean? 
Less than one week after, this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering. 
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column, and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net. 
Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures. 
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered? 
Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and I doubt that it's several hundred. 
Come the one year anniversary of my journey, I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey -- and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor. 
After all, online course content has been available for a while. 
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. 
I was born in Calcutta -- a family where my father and his father before him were journalists, and they wrote magazines in the English language. 
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start, if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff, so it's important that we focus on outcomes. 
There are 800 million people starving. 
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story. 
You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center. 
So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all move around. 
Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world. 
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. 
But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots. 
So it challenged everything we knew in cancer, is that you don't need to get a response. 
And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like. 
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. 
And you can see, it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing. 
Thank you for giving me a voice." 
And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions. 
I'd hoped for something simpler: to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way. 
I'm going off to build Google Glass. 
These were the men of the whaleship Essex, whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick." 
To do that, you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert. 
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs, and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away. 
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel. 
And I really do think we have to start thinking about what's a good planet and what isn't. 
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. 
And what did I discover? 
It's the old concept, the real Greek concept, of philanthropy in its original sense: phil-anthropy, the love of humankind. 
You make me go to this. You make me listen. 
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark. 
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life? 
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought. 
Video: (Buzzer) Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square. 
We gave talks once a month, and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens, worm culture, recycling, water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause) Our latest endeavor, with a grant from the Department of Corrections at Washington state, they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons. 
Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians. 
(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK. 
You can hear the five-year-old mind working. 
My point is that this is not oil drilling. 
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya. 
(Laughter) Love and peace were mentioned. 
We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be, nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. 
So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. 
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success. 
Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do, and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation. 
So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself. 
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery, took six more months to have all the reinnervation. 
We can get our arms around a hundred companies. 
And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved, radically improved vaccines. 
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. 
Now surprisingly, it seems to work. 
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture, You know, brain surgery, atomic theory, genetics, economics are complex complex fields. 
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life, you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank. 
But much more importantly, the distribution is much wider. 
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

Watson does not travel. 
And you do it automatically and non-consciously. 
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"

If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world, and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world. 
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself. 
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago. 
They were yelling at him, they were -- it got to be really ugly. 
Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming. 
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted are available each hour next week. 
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models, is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year. 
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. 
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy. 
These Christians are nuts. 
We just had this vote, and everybody's like, "Well, not in our state.

Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw. 
Ritchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure. 
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models, and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough. 
This is actually our "cult picture." 
It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up, whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals. 
It's what's rewarding to you. 
Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. 
1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 -- we're finding about two or three a month. 
But the picture is changing, and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene. 
I. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York, all of his friends' parents would ask them "What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day. 
Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft. 
Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. 
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way. 
Or terror, as the case may be? Right? 
And you can do it the same, over and over again." 
So we updated them, so I could present it here, to 2007. 
It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick, I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris. 
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective. 
Although, the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher. 
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was. 
And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. 
So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease. 
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like — This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds) For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds) This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds) This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter) Which is like yellow, this one. 
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight. 
It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave. 
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. 
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one. 
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know -- it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.

I think that's wrong, but -- (Laughter) I think it's right for argumentation. Right? 
That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist, and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, close to 70 million people a year. 
We know where you are going. 
But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. 
In infrastructure, let's just take one example. 
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. 
But to us he was just Dad, and our home life was pretty normal. 
GG: Talking. Really hard. Really. 
Then you have to push it down again. 
And basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. 
The story starts with just a single person, a child, behaving a little strangely. 
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. 
And what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations -- that is, changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF-1. 
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."

And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels. 
If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the U.S. would look like today.

I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second, which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. 
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach. 
The great news is we already know what works. 
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade, and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it. 
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money. 
How do you start? 
The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B, and it misses all the other ways that a street is used. 
But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know? 
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. 
I do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going. 
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."

And puzzling it is. 
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women. 
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone, your credit card, your computer. The result is big data, and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition. 
And during that time, since I've left university, these numbers have got bigger and bigger, each one dwarfing the last, until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper, who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime, only to see it snatched away by a rival university. 
This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. 
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers, five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here. 
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. 
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. 
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. 
Humans ran and ran all the time. 
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem. 
I said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes? It's a picture of the Nenets." 
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy, expensive and very inefficient. 
Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions. 
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. 
Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.

The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending, to show them what their neighbors are spending, and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending. 
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors. 
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected. 
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. 
Health to the ocean means health for us. 
The lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down." 
We try. Yeah. You help me. 
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs. 
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. 
So you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I gotta admit, just because I was struggling with this because I'm here, but I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you, not only to be here in front of you, but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus, because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.

Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. 
It was breaking the ice, it was getting over a stigma, and I think that's also what design can do. 
We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there. 
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.

So to sum it up, we need trust to play, and we need trust to be creative. So, there’s a connection. 
This is him on the screen. 
But even when I take it away, the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns. 
They're demographics, education, debt and inequality. 
And this was really disappointing to Doug, because before this time he was proud of what he did. 
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through. 
And she's a very high-tech superintendent. 
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution, of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton. 
It can be compiled into this -- into zeros and ones -- and pronounced by a computer. 
But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. 
He got convicted. 
Wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing, engaging seriously with big moral questions, exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup, students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge, Massachusetts and create a global classroom. 
It's got all the ups and the downs of movements. 
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property led to this corruption. 
Any guesses? 1816. 
So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star. 
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. 
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys. 
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market." 
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks." 
It's my response, my attitude, to oppression that I've got control over, and that I can do something about. 
We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else." 
Two years ago, I knew exactly what an icon looked like. 
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. 
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. 
Well, that lasted 17 years. 
It's a new experience. 
Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars, and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon, but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet? 
And this was an amazing year. 
That was their perception. 
By this age the brain can actually store. 
Does that sound improbable to you? 
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that, and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community, they've also pondered that. 
So I invite you to explore the opportunities. 
Thank you. 
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. 
I would encourage you to become a cyborg. 
Thank you. (Applause) Well, it's great to be here. 
All of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing, is underpinned by statistics. 
And in the United States Senate, we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the Senate, and this room can help. 
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything, but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology, and that is: why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed? 
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner. 
So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much, but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently. 
(Laughter) So I wanted to show you guys -- I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface. 
Sometimes hammer-on. 
The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. 
He gave each of them some mescaline, and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while. 
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies. 
But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories. 
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school, a military takeover happened in my country, a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope, and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest. 
So they're reinventing it, using these tools. 
True navigation begins in the human heart. 
You know of "The March of the Penguins." 
Now, one more time, and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open. 
Afghans have become deeply internationalist. 
And these calendars really started to lay out my program. 
It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. 
He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect. 
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial. 
So I could not attract her attention, but something, a thing, did. 
And I want to ask the question -- and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well, because we believe in growth. 
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me? 
It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife. 
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions. 
Can you place that down into the floor? 
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program. 
That's the media environment we've got. 
So if you want to address it, the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races. 
Well, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. 
And that's packed in there as well. 
I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. 
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. 
I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns, which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. 
I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels. 
Now, out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading, how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve? 
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do. 
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late '80s. 
So this is a paper nautilus. 
We need, for instance, to bring in radiant cooling technology, and we need to combine this with so-called soft conditioning. 
So when I virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback. 
The color represents different rooms they are in the house. 
And this is where you feel real compassion for them. 
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom. 
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record of that entire ecology. 
In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life. 
"This is my life." 
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently. 
And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history. 
And I was -- I usually travel alone when I do my work, but I did this -- I hosted a program for Discovery, and when I went down with the team, I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani, deep into the Huaorani tribe. 
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. 
People want to customize their lives. 
And we just monitored how much candy participants took. 
How about the people who can't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example? 
These are two different subjects in our study. 
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world with brute-force assembly techniques. 
And for the most part, the stories are recycled. 
The overlong ears, the overlarge feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble. 
And now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren. 
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone. 
We're not taking the bonus yet. 
So, rather than have it fight or do industrial work, we decided to build a planter, put the robot into the center of it, and we called it the Telegarden. 
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter, some solid substance falling down and disintegrating. 
Somebody said that yesterday. 
I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language, that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world, I didn’t talk and this was the last time this person’s going to be here interpreting for me. 
It's a school where you do learn reading -- one of my favorites -- writing -- I was bad at it -- arithmetic. 
I was in the grips of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me. 
The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important. 
But the choice was theirs, and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide. 
And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion, is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered. 
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it. 
(Applause) Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was among friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. 
And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain, recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. 
This one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway, he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female. 
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance. 
It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough. 
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting, the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart. 
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration. 
It was also an expensive fight. 
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this. 
This works in physics. This works in geology. But if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like? This is what neuroscience looks like. 
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium, and it engulfs it and eats it. 
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk. 
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country flew to San Francisco to testify against them -- to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane. 
We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements? 
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene, attached it to a blue marker, and we injected it into the embryos. 
But those kind of manifestations started to grow, and they kept happening. 
It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall. 
Gone." 
An economist would never do that. 
And so you see a net force away from the sun. 
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response. 
So basically you have a chain of elements. 
And that's what I came to study. 
Almost everybody knows this, from nobel laureates to golf caddies, or was taught it, as I was. 
Now a lung is something very strange. 
You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's "Paradise Lost." 
So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. 
You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. 
Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations -- how your parents approach Internet security, versus how you do, versus how our kids will. 
I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. 
It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. 
We use now some type of technologies, where for solid organs, for example, like the liver, what we do is we take discard livers. 
One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. 
(Laughter) But if we believe we're better than the other guy, well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married, because we're more social, more interesting. 
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk? 
And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee." 
They're actually closer than any species we've observed. 
Now, this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper -- no scotch tape, no cuts. 
And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back, and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones. 
They protested across Britain. 
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. 
Yes, sure. 
And I saw that thing seven times in one month. 
(Laughter) No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. 
But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. 
And they could be extinct in less than 10 years, if we don't do something now to protect them. 
That's what brainstorming is about, right? 
Take a look at these. 
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani. 
We were obviously making a difference. 
Would you like to see destruction? 
The uncle went back to his family, and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner. 
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler. 
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman. 
He had an idea, a very clear idea. 
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now? 
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat. 
They're often quite brief. They're often very seasonally constrained. 
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of anything that you actually see in nature, that looks that shade. 
So go ahead, ask yourself, what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail? 
And in this case, they did. 
So in the course of my career, I have covered a series of failures. 
So, in order to really create a full image, I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me, which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable. 
And those bumps act like a magnet for water. 
So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. 
And it hasn't been the last. 
And back to the yew here. 
So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. 
Don't tempt me, because I will do it. 
Where do we get this spark of imagination? 
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second. 
There’d be a little paper me. And a little paper you. 
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want. 
And you know why they have a design? 
But fortunately, it also works the other way around. 
What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter? 
So I turned traditional pills into this. 
Please drive your car home over it," they would have said, "Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges. 
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery -- this is another art gallery installation. 
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point. 
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. 
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it. 
So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs, the other one is out there foraging, and the longer they have to stay gone, the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back. 
First of all, they heard some laughs, and they had to say, how real or posed do these laughs sound? 
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget. 
Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. 
This was really an extraordinary advance, because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells, which still remain the gold standard, they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery. 
The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about. 
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. 
And we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable, tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years. 
(Applause) I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. 
BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open. 
And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work. 
You're laughing to show that you like them. 
Thanks. 
Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment. 
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions. 
NINJA is an acronym that stands for Narrativas Independentes Jornalismo e Ação, or in English, independent narratives, journalism, and action. 
(Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 
In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego. 
We can categorize it like that. 
Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard, and people are starting to wake up about that. 
And there is thousands of these. 
Among them there was my right-hand man, Najmuddin. 
I do so many things on this little device. 
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. 
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal. 
So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world, how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale, so that we can go from a world like this to a world that's more like this. 
Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. 
And of course habits are enforced by architecture. 
So, you know, for years I would go to bars and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately, or something. 
As a result, the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English -- (Laughter) rapid improvement and all sorts of things. 
Let's move the dial a little bit to the past. 
If she got pregnant before she got married, the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished. 
All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. 
I mean look, you can see the necktie, but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little, small atom. 
The second important myth to understand -- because we have to destroy these myths, dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them -- the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem -- if it is a problem, it's only a small problem, that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent, it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever, and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it. 
They have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas, and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. 
And I never needed eyes to see -- never. 
About 90 percent of them were women and children. 
So, let's take control of this nightmare: implement a gas tax immediately; transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh; require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards; and, of course, use mesh networks. 
So, this possibility of a new type of global recognition, I think, is driving huge amounts of effort. 
But it's a broad and very delicate subject, so I have to limit myself. 
So that in one generation, we're going to halve our cultural diversity. 
This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. 
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected. 
This is my favorite part of my speech. 
And he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10. 
Now, this is real innovation, not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. 
That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am. 
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing. 
And one great example that you'll appreciate: During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago, the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days, and all these students had refused to leave the lab. 
I can see the rocks are over here. 
We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. 
Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. 
They didn't know why they didn't kill me. 
But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own. 
We aren't functioning so easily anymore. 
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution. 
Well, first of all, they feed us and they also give us the oxygen we breathe, but plants are also the source of important, biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully, because human societies over the millennia, they have developed important knowledge, cultural traditions, and important plant-based medicinal resources. 
And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small. 
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. 
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar. 
I just want you to name the color of the object. 
And I think that can be some really good news. 
And that's when I discovered comedy. 
We can do it with existing political structures. 
Well, actually, you could do it the other way. 
Why are you so passionate?" 
So then here's the final ranking. 
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero, that just breaks you in so many ways. 
And most folks don't even know they exist. 
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation, but actual voting behavior. And also we were able, with this sample, to look across the world, in 121 different countries we asked the same questions, and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed into 10 different geographical regions. 
It's the first view. 
It might be Latin American. 
(Laughter) I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though. 
Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying, "Well hey, there might be some problems" -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on. 
And yet, again, you're not all in one room. 
Why would you use this example of all examples?" 
Or, "How do I make it green materials? 
For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. 
In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles. 
But that's only half of real equality, and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. 
My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags. 
And so a new awareness will have to arise, of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves, in a new way, and come together as a community to manage systemic risk. 
But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission. 
They did so illegally. 
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there. 
So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. 
You can see their scars. You trust them. 
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today, with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean. 
So I find ... 
Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice. 
These companies have begun to think differently. 
And so what you see there is the difference. 
The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million, which is a reduction of 95 percent. 
That can be an uncomfortable experience, particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. 
What's different about them?" 
With a thousand Juliáns working together, Mexico would be a very different country. 
Now, how far does this analogy go? 
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. 
And I thought, "What am I thinking? 
We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats. 
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business. 
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. 
And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. 
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting. 
That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. 
After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field, and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. 
(Laughter) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time. 
And so in this case, because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent, and the kinds of questions they bring up, that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say, "Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?" 
Well, we had a party. This is Africa -- we have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me. 
(Laughter) And then she said, "Dad, we're Lego rich." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. 
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. 
and working with NGOs and building this case. 
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them. 
So, I think we have to ask again the question: Why leave women's health to chance? 
(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades. 
And in those days, my hair was down to my waist, I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried, I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter) But I had three days of life support, and everybody was expecting, due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it, so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop, and — (Laughter) — when I finally pooped, then that somehow, surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line, and, um — (Laughter) — 
And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic, most fundamental human staple. 
(Laughter) According to this self-help book, guys brains are like waffles; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. 
So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs, but it's better for their heads. 
Soon, my items began selling all over the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and more. 
We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests. 
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals. 
We need to be at least as serious as we were then. 
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone," but actually you do take the pictures and put on information. 
Show us the grades." 
Any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science. 
You succeed or fail quickly. 
In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people, 10 percent of the population, homeless. 
Hard problems are hard. 
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor. 
What you're going to learn is this. 
They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. 
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process, which was incredibly important to them. 
Because through your mask, they let theirs go. 
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science. 
You can't make that one up. 
First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games. 
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully. 
It's the thing that makes us human. 
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. 
For many years this went along, and everything was fine. 
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. 
"Know thyself," that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling. 
How clever would we have to be? 
And it turns out, we've even done it. 
(Laughter) And I was like, "That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy. 
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq. ft. 
So here's a picture of the octopamine system. 
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time. 
But you know what? 
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions. 
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left. 
We are now interdependent. 
And the cables go really continent to continent. 
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes. 
When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. 
But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. 
Space as you perceive it is your desktop. 
(Applause) And so I want to do a little demo for you. 
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing, and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second, more maneuverable than a normal boat. 
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth, five years of productivity growth in the workplace, but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. 
Carroças are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil, much like graffiti and street art. 
But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. 
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there. 
They postulate fundamental laws governing them, like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics. 
And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. 
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water, sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy, and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities, you could also include in such a facility aquaculture. 
It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share. 
He said, "No, no. I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work." 
"We have lasers; we can whiten it out." 
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me because, like the intro, I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right? 
Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things. 
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful. 
One is that -- it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish, which means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law, if they don't catch you during the night. 
We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you. 
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic. 
And then how did I deal with them? 
This is something we've actually known for a while, so it's not a real breakthrough. 
So flies love this. 
By the way, DSL is a kludge. 
We think that polemics -- (Applause) -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 
That's why nations rise and fall. 
You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. 
But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. 
I imparted all these good values to my school, girl students and boy students as well. 
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military, congress, the education system, etc. 
It's protecting five World Heritage sites. 
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions. 
I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network." 
And that really describes information technology. 
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored, which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you. 
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there? 
I'd like you to come and design it." 
I played in the backyard, learned to read, and even ate some of my vegetables. 
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new. 
Tehran was not interested. 
Go ahead and hit that right sound icon. 
The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. 
So they ran the Pac-Man game. 
What we still do perhaps too often. 
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility. 
Is it so that in Kenya, there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office? 
I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love, what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato, over 2,000 years ago. 
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously, I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi, one of my heroes and mentors really, he managed to get UNICEF involved. 
Computer: ♫ Memory, thump. ♫ CL: ♫ Thump of the beat in a known repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete ♫ ♫ The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed ♫ ♫ Psychopathic words in my head appear ♫ ♫ Whisper these lyrics only I can hear ♫ ♫ The art of discovering and that which is hovering ♫ ♫ Inside the mind of those unconfined ♫ 
And we finally figured out how to do it. 
And that is the real network effect. 
What may be more reprehensible, if climate denial continues, is extermination of species. 
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?" 
Or even in the Swiss office of Google, which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all. 
In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer. 
Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul. 
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial. 
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better. 
The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. 
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. 
Well if you're reclined a great deal, you have to use muscle force to hold your head there. 
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game, EVE Online. 
HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together. 
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. 
And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom, I was beside myself. 
If you live in New York, you know how the bike messengers move. 
We've got problems all over our educational system despite Race to the Top. 
I want to find out what's in this zone. 
As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing. 
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. 
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. 
One could say this is about community, collectivity. 
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. 
The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve. 
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that." 
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions. 
(Laughter) Secondly, we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. 
We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool. 
I don't see it the way you characterized it. 
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities. 
It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues, it has now expanded. 
This is good because over the past five years, there have been times when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible." 
So life might be insignificant in size, but it is not insignificant in time. 
Ezra: I don’t remember. 
I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors, where we're incarcerating low-level, nonviolent people and we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people, is that we don't have an objective measure of risk. 
(Laughter) This has spread all over the world. 
Now, there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that, is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack, eliminating the threat altogether. 
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know, it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on. 
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain. 
I think it's interesting in that this facility, I think, is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries, literally, every country in the world -- because we have seeds from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive. 
And just to make a long story short: first of all, the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. 
(Laughter) So this is the sketch of the two states. 
I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. 
On the emotional side, we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them. 
We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer, because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation. 
And that's exactly what I'm saying. 
It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. 
Some of them are political. Many of them are physical. 
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth. 
So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16. 
I had intended to write a constructive, multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. 
So the scene: the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in. 
And depending on who you ask, the surge was supposed to push it up even further. 
We found out that we could go to the source rock, which were the carboniferous shales in the basins. 
people weren't noticing these things -- a chain hanging down -- and that's shown very, very nicely in the movie. 
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com. 
Being the kind of suspicious person I am, I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here, I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things. 
So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control. 
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues? 
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today. 
There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States. 
But compassion, the generation of compassion, actually mobilizes our immunity. 
It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land. 
Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled. 
And so I starting thinking, not only am I not happy with the past, now I'm getting choked with, "I've only got 22 years left." 
And what was different about it was the totality of it, was that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place in a way I had never done before, where every aspect -- the smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was -- was designed by me. 
But no, this guy isn't slowing down. 
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude, the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable, that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&amp;D effort. 
And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. 
(Applause) I, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. 
These are the lonely warriors like my father and many, many others, and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds. 
Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti, professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. 
Or another analogy would be, a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly. 
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. 
(Music) ♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ... ♫ ♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and I have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ... ♫ ♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ... ♫ 
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade. 
And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician, realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals, you get the shapes of nature. 
For every X you sell, you get Y, you do your services of Z. 
And this is the 21st century. 
Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. 
What is the cost of not trying? 
Perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured. 
Most of them should be in orbit around something. 
And I testified to that inquiry in secret. 
And of course the iron curtains, political walls have come tumbling down. 
IPaidABribe.com is really important, a good one to log on to and see. 
I used to be a summer camp counselor. 
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day. 
There is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city. 
And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's. 
Sales were up. 
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. 
I love her, you know. 
T.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose." 
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light. 
That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies, early on, and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background. 
So cities are where the action is. 
And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. 
(Laughter) "I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee. 
Were we even a group? What group? 
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here, I thought to myself that well, it's TED. 
Thank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.) (Applause) We have a global health challenge in our hands today, and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly, takes far too long, and it fails more often than it succeeds. 
You may have seen it. 
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it. 
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. 
The question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is, why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret? 
And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built. 
But in the non-Muslim communities of the Middle East, such as some Christian communities, Eastern communities, you see the same practice. 
My students were the only ones spared from that fate. 
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there. 
And it's a straight line. 
(Music) So you see, he played this note. 
For example, one of my challenges was textbooks. 
It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements, it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to, say, reproduce and evolve. 
So, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline associated with aging, or associated with stress. 
I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care, because now I needs a new jacket to wear." 
I've got to admit I feel silly saying that. 
And the world population in the meantime has doubled. 
(Applause) Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist, and we both study complex networks. 
I called that project Women Are Heroes. 
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois, right? 
But what is most important here is, who do we finance? 
And with money we got from DARPA, we could show just that. 
This is all the press we got, and we said, it's time to celebrate. 
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts. 
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly. 
This is not just through malaria. 
(Video) Narrator: You want to look through your target's eyes. 
So that got me thinking, what if our technology could sense our emotions? 
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. 
We play musical instruments. 
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days? 
And one of the things that we know is that, unfortunately, if you have a heart attack, then that tissue can start to die, and your outcome may not be very good over time. 
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. 
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is, I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything -- for yourself, your family, or your employees -- unless you've really done your homework. 
But they lose, right? 
And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something. 
They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime. 
The exponential growth of computing started decades before Gordon Moore was even born. 
It's funny, my wife, Daisy, whose family is littered with schizophrenics -- and I mean littered with them -- once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God. 
Come to the Florida sunshine bush, where there are lemons, where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val headed back into the library. 
But before we start, I need just to put these on. 
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do." 
And after a few days, depending upon temperature, the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside. 
Think of the AlloSphere as a large, dynamically varying digital microscope that's connected to a supercomputer. 
In the 1980s, as America went through a transition in the Reagan period, between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California, that was the end of America. 
So control is no longer a zero-sum game. 
This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear, but by the fact that they were there at a time when women -- officially, at least -- remained banned from ground combat, and America had no idea they existed. 
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest, and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. 
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. 
It all began for him during World War II, when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop. 
We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately, and so we can be confident that, in the normal case, our perceptions are accurate. 
And he takes this one. 
This is a minute 59. 
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there. 
And perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it. 
And I don't know who's watching who, but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. 
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. 
He doesn't need salt and pepper. 
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. 
Of course we don't. 
And it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. 
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet, but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history, and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. 
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. 
(Laughter) No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie. 
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play. 
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work. 
My life was not exuberant. 
So you want to be a little bit below the average number, but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well. 
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow? 
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. 
How is the brain able to do this? 
The maps they gave us are out of date by years." 
These are real quotes and it's real sad. 
If we worry too much about some things, we end by not worrying about other things. 
(Applause) (Music) Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor. 
It's second nature to them. 
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. 
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board." 
So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. 
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers. 
This is in front of Macy's, and they were a big supporter of this new approach, because they understood that more people on foot is better for business. 
In 1969, the internet was but a dream, a few sketches on a piece of paper. 
So as soon as I completed my education, I brought my family to America. 
You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it, but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie. 
Then, I started drilling down, thinking about the computations I might want to do, trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible. 
And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything. 
There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. 
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive. 
Blithering fucking idiots. 
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing. 
What are the kind of jobs that we have today? 
But, like all of us, he had some problems. 
Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box. 
So, this is the one that can't walk at all. 
We have to go for a global truce. 
One idea, one world, one market. 
(Laughter) The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European. 
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers? 
And these scales evolved into what is known as kiñit, the unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today. 
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. 
As Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities. 
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer, who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary. 
Now let me stop here. 
No Labels and Common Cause, I think, have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective. 
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time, and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area. 
There are other dimensions for flaps. 
And the bed is back in this space, with windows looking out onto the lake. 
So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. 
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance. 
And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue. 
Why do we need to study this anymore? 
What about Africa? 
Guns, gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January. 
They're also big. 
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents. 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor, we went to the harbor commissioner. 
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on. 
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. 
Day three. 
(Laughter) But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project. 
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight. 
(Laughter) Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa. 
Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago, we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now. 
(Applause) Is there anything unique about human beings? 
By the time we met, she had 20 employees, most of them women, who were sending their boys and their girls to school. 
They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see. 
I think that number's probably going to go up. 
The fourth element is that the high-value U.S. targets are accessible, soft and plentiful. 
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army. 
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now. 
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future. 
They're relieving congestion, and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. 
But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. 
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem, because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys, their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science, and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public. 
And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. 
Aristotle said, "We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows." 
If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria. 
(Laughter) We're told what to wear -- (Laughter) -- and how to do our hair -- (Laughter) -- and how to behave. 
You're just one of the people who hasn't been told. 
From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. 
Nobody is controlling what you do. 
(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker) This is Chet Baker. 
It has got to be you. 
So, the patients print it out, because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network. 
And the Indus script now has this particular property. 
So this is the final object. 
It falls to the floor. 
And I realized that we had a frontier here, a very important one, that it was just a matter of changing the perspective, and the web could be actually used, already used, as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel, TV network, and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment, even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue, so if it happens, bear with me please, even someone like me could become a broadcaster. 
And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. 
It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers, and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller. 
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. 
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. 
And these existed for tens of millions of years. 
We see cities, we see oil fields, you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea, that we are dominating much of our planet, and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night. 
Don't even know the day I'll ever return. 
All right then. 
And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. 
(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear? 
And then the paper burned. 
In this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood, knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential. 
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab, we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope, and they see something in the tissue sample. 
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business. 
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. 
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love." 
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man. 
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits, snakes, and anything that had life. 
Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants, and they get their money back in two or three years. 
Then what happens to the waste? 
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. 
And what's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton, it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide. 
So obviously I Googled for it. 
But this single-mindedness will not yield the flexibilities of mind, the multiplicity of perspectives, the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs. 
And then, of course, in the natural course of things, they will expand back. 
And the kind of elements I'm talking about are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse, a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.

They're probably less cell dense. 
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. 
We have collectively forgotten that lesson. 
And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage. 
We are a country of victims. 
I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian, the amazing Egyptian. 
Different frames of reference. 
And just as 30 years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts, that we're carrying around in our cell phone today, and suddenly, computing, that used to be an expert driven system, it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. 
This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon, and I was about 4,000 feet from release. 
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink -- we've been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad. Pretty good. 
And by this time I was hooked. 
Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. 
Man: I got the back legs. 
In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist. 
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen. 
So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is. 
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges. 
And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. 
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press: On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds. 
Think of German unification, 1990. 
That's at 78 degrees north. 
Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. 
And the results may at first seem incredible, but as Marshall McLuhan said, "Only puny secrets need protection. 
It's no different than sending a text. 
Don't let it claim you. 
Six to nine months at the right time of the year. 
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately, the improvement of the planet itself. 
They all came together. 
But before we began, our land looked like that. 
They're even more shocked by what he says. 
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red, think twice about yellow. 
There will be many teams like our team that work on this. 
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail. 
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime. 
It's a story about beyond biomimetics, to something I'm calling biomutualism. 
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right. 
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less? 
So this is Zig in this photograph. This is also one of Zig's photographs. He's a photographer. 
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now, till we hit the second microbial age. 
Can you imagine how small it is? 
And in addition, about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised. 
And it's kind of constrained by that circle. 
And his answer was yes. 
They talk about these kinds of experiences. 
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought, "There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer." 
So I wanted to have that little image. 
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain. 
But instead, surprisingly, he said, "Oh, bring her down here for a year, and if I can't win her over, no one can." 
Here's some faces on the side of a rock. 
I never did this. I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom. 
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. 
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. 
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators. 
Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead, allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland. 
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too. 
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it? 
That one can measure roughness by a number, a number, 2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more. 
It suggests that someone is driving. 
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion -- priming God, making people think about God -- often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior. 
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. 
Now, bad weather comes in, just land, fold up the wings, drive home. 
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients. 
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. 
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole. 
(Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. 
And they're nice big pages too. 
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!" 
If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child. 
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made. 
And he said, "But we've heard about you. 
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific, contextual, timely and immediate, is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented. 
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. 
(Laughter) That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days, and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network, but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. 
And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken. 
I don't talk about how they behave at home because that's measured elsewhere. 
We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. 
But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive, then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers. 
We got a flood of donations -- mostly 13-dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts (Laughter) but then, we got a money transfer for $10,000 -- really nice guy. 
So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. 
Because we have tested ARES model, several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years, under Mars conditions. 
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her, "Of Mice and Men" style. 
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. 
Let's see what people here think about it. 
These records were human resource forms. 
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs, about what they really are, what they came from, what they're made of, what their hidden nature is. 
It's highly commercial. 
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material, and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. 
This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish-like symbols and some other signs, but never by these other signs at the bottom. 
And understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is. 
In February, he approached the White House, and said, "I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better." 
So what it's doing is, it's replacing the retinal circuitry, really the guts of the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations, a set of equations that we can implement on a chip. So it's just math. 
When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan -- I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.

I did this series of calendars for Shiseido. 
And that rarely, if ever, caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. 
So, this trauma -- what is it? 
Two years ago, you saw this creature. 
It's horrible conditions, because wherever you have nice weather, plants grow, and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs. 
And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Israel feared an Iraqi victory and actively helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's American weaponry at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable because of an American arms embargo that Israel was more than happy to violate. 
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. 
But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later, and I didn't know what that was. 
And in fact, we are in the era of what I would call "massive-passive" data collection efforts. 
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it. 
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. 
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces." 
A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine. 
You are now consciousness without an object, freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory. 
And what's interesting to me about games, in some sense, is that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics and compress them into very short-term kind of experiences. 
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. 
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin. 
(Laughter) So Robert Wright -- I don't know, I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to, it might have been him. 
And this one doesn't have anything for them. 
And you then ask the question: Why is the water hot? 
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment. 
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney. 
So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity. 
Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment, plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits, while feeding people for pennies on the dollar. 
It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight. 
Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year. 
So, what have we learned from this about cheating? 
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion. 
What are the emotions that can be measured? 
(Laughter) So -- so this was my nature. The thing was, I saw that the route that I took to discovering this focus in my work and who I was, I saw it as just this road to discovery. 
Okay, we also built this injector, so this injector makes the plasma to start with. 
You only hear the low frequencies. 
What I discovered was this is not true. 
When we're dealing with people like this? 
I've got one, he's everywhere, go find him." 
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? 
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved, but also that drives up output across the board. 
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground: basically, animal, mineral, vegetable. 
Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom. 
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. 
In many African countries the modern sector is lost. 
I don’t remember how we got there. 
The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them, and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth.

Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything. 
Those days are over, never to return. 
We didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood. 
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to. 
So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity. 
It blocks the right too, as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible. 
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. 
Members were encouraged to bring their wives, daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association, and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one, they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well. 
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this. 
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. 
Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell, we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in. 
I'm put on full life support, and I have a massive stroke, and my brain drops into a coma. 
In this case, the process is deterministic. 
And at this point, by this summer, everybody -- scientists, sports scientists, endurance experts, neurologists, my own team, Bonnie -- said it's impossible. 
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids? 
It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity. 
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool. 
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones." 
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country. 
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. 
Dumped without political participation, decent education, any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives, and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. 
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, "Oh, I could use it for this and this and this." 
An enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of London, find him, bring him not back to Charles Stewart, but to a ship, the Ann and Mary, that was floating in London Harbour, and he was chained to the deck, and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica. 
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. 
All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope. 
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day? 
Yes, we are a brilliant and creative species, but we've created a little too much stuff -- so much that our economy is now bigger than its host, our planet. 
Right? 
I have to say, I don't understand it. 
And they sit around, and they talk about dreams. 
As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need?" 
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. 
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me. 
And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort, to amenities -- it was very, very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image, would be very, very stylishly packaged. 
What the others are here for, I've no idea." 
Shehu: And from there we will be able to, hopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions. 
So we talk about PMTCT, and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission. 
So, they went to the police and they said, "We know that at the Rome railroad station, there are all these lost souls wandering around, muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?" 
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one. 
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. 
And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem, because it only super-empowers people more. 
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene -- and not just okay, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat. 
They were also lucky, they said, because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction, between port authority, airport authority, two city districts, and a review board. 
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria. 
If we look at Islamists, if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists, one thing they've been very good at, one thing that they've actually been exceeding in, is communicating across borders, using technologies to organize themselves, to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena. 
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. 
I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good, that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are, as individuals and as a species. 
David is fearless of technology, and he is absolutely tenacious. 
Well, this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories, the unified theories, which try to explain all those 18 free parameters in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them. 
(Laughter) You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked. 
(Laughter) But we'd be rich! 
This is what I would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again. 
A miracle? 
(Laughter) At the end of the course, the students got a certificate. 
I remember, for some reason, that they were exactly the same height. 
So we say, in general, that there's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon, or its description, unchanged. 
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores, a greater comfort level with the material, especially with the boys, that in going outside and playing, they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. 
Thank you. 
You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet. 
PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark, what that was like, going off onto a mission, one presumes safely, but it's never a guarantee, and knowing that Gabby is — MK: Well not only was she still in the hospital, on the third day of that flight, literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station, and you've got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour, I'm actually flying it, looking out the window, a bunch of computers, Gabby was in brain surgery, literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured 
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it. 
She has this show right now at MoMA, where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls. 
María Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. 
There are plenty of downsides. 
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript. 
So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory, in life, or in the balloon, we have to change altitude. 
And in discovery phase, we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring. 
That happens to be our cafeteria line. 
But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years is that you actually don't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren't obviously not our universe. 
There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council -- it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia — and it was done by a local professor, a university professor. 
Do I have a place, a venue, in mind when I write? 
And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. 
This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know. 
So that pain has gone out. 
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions, but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can't happen from outside, it has to come from within. 
He doesn't need Adam. 
This is what a leader is. 
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people. 
Thank you. 
Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording. 
Can we run that, Andrew? 
(Applause) The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used. 
So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does, but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet. 
It redefines the role of skin, and our bodies become an atomizer. 
We have to go away. We cannot stay here." 
This is a photograph of a brave British soldier. 
And actually, we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well-being. 
And it's built to a pretty high standard of design. 
And keep an eye out for sharks. 
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. 
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. 
Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off. 
These will be places that are not worth caring about. 
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations. 
No one's listening. No one's trusting. 
Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. 
Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. 
(Music) (Applause) This is me building a prototype for six hours straight. 
And it's not just what these are doing to each other, but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. 
And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them. 
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. 
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric, which became General Electric, paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. 
But it's taken a long time to get there. 
Oh, hah. 
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protect, but how to care for each other. 
Is that your final answer? 
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. 
And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. 
This is all happening with excess capacity. 
This is the view from my apartment, over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony. 
Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing -- and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped. 
(Laughter) Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt? 
We've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later. 
They knew what happened. 
Now we can write the way we talk. 
I know famous musicians, I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned, and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground, as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside. Children in care, who've had a life in care, deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood. 
I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars. 
So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first. 
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. 
That was called a 360 flip. Notice how the board flipped and spun this way, both axes. 
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan." 
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time. 
So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like, interesting colors and interesting behaviors, and they're very easy to make, and they have interesting lifelike properties, perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step, one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth. 
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo. 
He turned beet red, and he wouldn't even look at me. 
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits, but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers. 
I'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter) And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo. 
And he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka, because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her," and he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom." 
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle looking up at me with big eyes, and I started, there was a white board behind me, and I started off by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said, "All right, now look, this is the number of stars in the visible universe, and this number is so big there's not even a name for it." 
So he was there when I woke up, and it was, waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain. 
What I found was, I started working with refugees and famine victims -- small farmers, all, or nearly all -- who had been dispossessed and displaced. 
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies. 
As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban, but it's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it, a whole generation ago. 
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants. 
Another point about education: we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it. 
They're the largest of the tunas, the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish. 
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down, and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention, because they're kind of like little kids. 
And we looked around the world to Canada and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa, and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence. 
What was I thinking?" 
We have been here for about 130,000 years. 
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather -- yes, make a beautiful website, who am I to say don't make a beautiful website? 
Aging is a big problem for humanity, and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy, we can enable us to do the same thing. 
So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. 
Some years later, I and this woman -- we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" -- (Laughter) -- went traveling through the south of Portugal together. 
And we've practiced that. 
And I'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then. 
That was back when the population was around 100 million people. 
They prefer to look at people rather than at things, and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes, because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences, so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away. 
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up. 
If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate -- to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue, whatever that cancer has been put there to do -- it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. 
They were developed in Japan pretty recently. 
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning, because there's good news in the morning. 
But you also need to have values. 
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. 
They divide them farther. 
For most strains, you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg. 
Everyone was an owner in this page. 
So, my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor, but is an 18-year-old, otherwise unemployed, who has two things: He has a backpack full of these tests, and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample, and an AK-47. 
No, I'm kidding. 
There's many mysteries, these statues. 
Or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make. 
In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. 
We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure." 
I think what we need is action." 
Right? It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot. 
And I was really appalled, and I couldn't figure out what to do. 
And I see the power of music. 
I had somebody count the number of books with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. 
Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony, but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. 
I wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work. 
They said, "Yes, we did." 
So you get Google, you get Amazon, you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets. 
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs. 
And in fact, what did happen to my brain? 
One is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things. 
Second, we need to create the space for what I call "managed dissent." 
(Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Shukran. (Applause) A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here, what's going on with no difficulty at all. 
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision, with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well. 
There are some of you in this room, amazing people, who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. 
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. 
This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men, and those who don't yet know that they believe. 
I live in a country that was a beautiful country. 
It's really taken off the ground. 
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour. 
And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. 
CA: So, in terms of that diagnostic technology that you've got, where is that, and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale. 
By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. 
What is typical to those conditions, to essential tremor for example, is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you, or write legibly so people can understand it, and be really independent in your life without the help of others. 
What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox. 
Please, don't tell me there are no consequences to these things. 
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. 
As my referrals began to decrease, I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought, my God, I can't work anymore. 
My father was assassinated. 
To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte, silk is terrific. 
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. 
I'm feeling it. 
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. 
We were banned from Egypt, and our correspondents, some of them were arrested. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking. 
(Laughter) Wonderful news. 
SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. 
This act defines what a national lottery will look like. 
I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? 
We will watch children starve to death on TV. 
We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. 
And the women said, "It really is." 
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology. 
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now? 
And just put radially they're going out that way. 
In order to try to answer some of these questions, we again turn to technology, to biological technology, in this case, again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial, and actually following their movements. They're being watched everyday as we speak, to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is. 
I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep. 
Because if you do, then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing? 
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk, my goodness, they talk well. 
"Well, in order to reproduce." 
And sometimes military intervention is necessary. 
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. 
I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. 
I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see. 
Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders. 
And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass." 
If Cargill makes a decision, the entire palm oil industry moves, or at least 40 or 50 percent of it. 
That means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. 
For example, we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods. 
To reassure investors, central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same. 
So what's this all about? 
We can't do it all by ourselves. 
But do you think it was easy? 
Because you're not in the Middle East. 
You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know, and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. 
Let's just think through that idea. 
How many birds am I hearing? 
All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence. 
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted. 
That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition. 
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking, will allow the copy to be published. 
So, now you think, how is that possible? 
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee. 
(Laughter) Now, it's not just a funny headline -- it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. 
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day. 
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks, and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him, and I thought, is that what he's thinking about? 
And so right now, I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the Internet would be, and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year, and worse next year, and so on. 
So this is what we've built. 
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. 
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man. 
It doesn't matter if you fail. 
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution. 
I haven't talked to you for a long time, but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday, yeah, Saturday or Sunday, so now I'm calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now, and I'm going to probably call you again tomorrow or today, so I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
It was really something. 
Okay, people who say they're conservative, if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic, they would tell these corporations to go to hell. 
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education? 
You probably read something about it in the papers. 
That boy won a four-year scholarship on the strength of that photograph. 
One is a supermarket standard: white bread, pre-packaged, which I'm told is called a Wonderbread. 
(Laughter) I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them. 
It's not considered vintage -- she just likes certain music to sound a certain way. 
But there was a problem. And the problem was that: I wanted the entirety of the object, I wanted the weight behind the object. 
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. 
It might be deadly. 
How might we build a more merciful country? 
We were wrong. 
(Laughter) My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop. 
It's a liberation from our misconceptions, and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin. 
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq, where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. 
If a card shark gathers the cards together, immediately when he -- before he deals the card. Now, so I think, number three, I have arranged them in a full house. 
For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor. 
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass. 
And I looked at him -- he didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no. 
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier, they're not there. 
We can only drive it underground. 
They did. They agreed with me, and over the following years, we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage. 
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?" 
And so we first measured the number of notes. 
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes; both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee, both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists, both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after, and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. 
And nowhere was this brought home more than during Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was a superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time, hitting the iPhone capital of the universe -- (Laughter) -- and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before. 
And each time we make a new opportunity place, we're allowing a platform to make new ones. 
So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter? 
Or my favorite, "Liabhan chor greine," the great fish of the sun. 
I've been wrong a lot lately. 
I don't just mean through reported pain reduction, actual measured pain reduction. 
And I understand that. 
Went straight to the president. 
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. 
And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. 
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces, but they want to spread the message. 
(Laughter) So, we turned to the data again. 
But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
When Yared was seven years old his father died, and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, one of the oldest churches in the world. 
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. 
It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth, it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery. 
The house is 1949. 
It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae. 
Working for peace is very creative. 
That doesn't move." 
And the poem goes: "On the idle hill of summer, lazy with the flow of streams, hark I hear a distant drummer, drumming like a sound in dreams, far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by, dear to friend and food to powder, soldiers marching, soon to die." 
And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine, I don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic. 
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do. 
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change, bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world, but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. 
It's not because we have a lot of it. 
But they're very different types of memories. 
You have to choose either option A or option B. 
So it's a very nice little device. 
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst sounding venues on the planet: sports stadiums, basketball arenas and hockey arenas. 
What we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks. Say I'm working on darkslides, or a primo, that you guys know this stuff now. (Laughter) (Laughs) What you do is you cruise around the same streets that you've seen a hundred times, but suddenly, because you already have something in this fixed domain of this target, it's like, what will match this trick? 
Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception, you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us a deceptive species, especially when you think about the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale. 
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound. 
So if I pick the same command through many times, I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time. 
And as a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores, that I sort of lived my whole life, is process. 
I was sent straight away to my school principal, and my school principal, a sweet nun, looked at my book with disgust, flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes -- you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her -- and the nun slapped me on my face and said, "Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun." 
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long. 
To make sure these buildings are safe, it's not going to take policy -- it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. 
It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information, more good things happen. 
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. 
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate. 
(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese) Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa! 
So we have a very unequal world, and we need to change from "business as usual." 
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more. 
They are doing it because of one motivation only. 
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows. 
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc. 
Sure, good things happen, but amazing things stop happening. 
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. 
And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. 
So, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. 
So that was the low-fear group. 
If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. 
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. 
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect, and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it. 
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these, and I didn't have a helmet, either. 
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves. 
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. 
And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle, are circled around, hovering around that prediction. 
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing, because I really adore singing, and I think that music is the highest form of all art. 
And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion, broken up by a series of courts, and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space for their administrative offices. 
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years, and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places, wild things, certainly wildlife, and the amazing qualities that penguins have. 
And September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate." 
And apart from things like entertainment, you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf, or, at least, not yet. 
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. 
If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off, and prevents another fire from starting. 
If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind? 
I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris, told him that I was completely sick. 
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together. 
So I got the list; I made the call. 
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. 
I created a company in America called Gonofone, which in Bengali means "people's phone." 
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. 
Thank you very much. 
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum. 
So we then went back and looked at the animal. 
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds. 
I also thought, how to close the building? 
(Laughter) We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. 
So that was a discovery. 
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. 
This actually shows the actual printer. 
Beth Israel's in Boston. 
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, "BBut it's not scalable, you know. 
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — (Laughter) — though his hands did not appear dirty." 
And so on. 
People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind. 
If you stay at a high weight for too long, probably a matter of years for most of us, your brain may decide that that's the new normal. 
And that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain. 
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side, with yesterday's theme. 
Those microscopic particles are still in space and time: they're still in the user interface. 
I suspect the latter. 
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, worldwide. 
I'd like to kick off by looking at education. 
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. 
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2. 
And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell. 
And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break. 
Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter) And, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think, because I told her I was working in computer security, and it was interesting to get her perspective. 
Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds, and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. 
They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet. 
I don't want to live in a rich country. 
(Applause) People say things about religion all the time. 
So that's the fourth question I'd like to leave you with: What vision of the good life do your designs convey? 
The Rubik's Cube. 
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns. 
First principles, this is very important. 
And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. 
By the beginning of May, the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted. 
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve. 
What can we do? We do everything that you told us to do. 
It was an invitation-only conference. 
So we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole. 
But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true. 
Thank you very much. 
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. 
This disease appears first as tumors, usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. 
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. 
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture. 
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground? 
Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent. 
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. 
There is, for example, a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world. 
And pretty soon, it was strangers. 
It was a study to specifically ask, what's going on with women? 
You are Noora the Light. 
When I tried my first trick, it looked like this. 
Specifically, they can do two things that previous generations have not done. 
And this can take quite a while. 
But we break it down to some basic realities. 
The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. 
But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record, when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least. 
It is absolutely possible. 
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region. 
The good news is I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar. 
We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. 
The library of the Free University, which opened last year, is an example of that. 
It's certainly a very important medium for input, and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display. 
There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit. 
The only way to find its outcome is, effectively, just to watch it evolve. 
So you figure out how to program this, and you put this in your mailbox. 
To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. 
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years, almost a 3.7 percent decline. 
Tom Reilly: Exactly. 
Let's take the example of the heart, the topic of a lot of my research. 
My solution: award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence. 
Leonardo had taught me, during that three years, about what a picture can do. 
They're going to get to land. 
(Laughter) Every building has a fountain. 
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot. 
We see above-ground mines. 
And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives, we've all been each other's relatives, actually. 
The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this. 
Forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010. 
Well, a few things. 
And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. 
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. 
They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one. 
So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. 
CC: A-rhythm-etic. Audience: A-rhythm-etic. 
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. 
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across. 
This is a deep question. 
That's a hypothetical example of course. 
(Laughter) But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. 
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you -- doing botany and wildlife conservation. 
And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead. 
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. 
It's about 100 million a day, which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year. 
They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking, "Wow, we can do this, and we should do this." 
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs. 
It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. 
So, this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. 
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country. 
First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief, and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time. 
Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. 
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. 
I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience. 
We wanted to use them to create openings. 
And the way to do that is to invest, not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption. 
Suppose that there are two diseases: one of them is rare, the other one is common, but if they are not treated they are equally severe. 
It's not that hard a problem. 
And it's also sometimes called algo trading, algorithmic trading." 
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption, and, through it, people like Sebastian are becoming micro-entrepreneurs. 
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10. 
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood. 
2,800 dollars per species is the average. 
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. 
You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something. 
Instead, I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. 
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. 
If you design a city with the blind in mind, sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. 
The threat is desertification. 
I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them. 
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move? 
We began to introduce that in our explorations, and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else, moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another. 
In literary criticism and analysis, probably 40 or 50 years ago, literary critics were a kind of cultural hero; now they're kind of a national joke. 
That's an awful lot of debt. 
And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me, in this metal and wood and leather pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device, and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. 
And this is the big difference. 
The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad, had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated, almost random, really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself, but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation, certainly for the first responders, and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology, or in terms of alphabetical, but through what's called meaningful adjacency. 
They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. 
And you can just look at the headlines. 
In a word, she stank. 
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first. 
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. 
So now I brought this up in front of him. 
Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. 
I was shaken up, and I sat on my table, and I said, "What am I going to do?" 
And then they've said to every single one of their workforce, if you can, help those communities grow, and help them to maintain their spaces. 
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you. 
But why? 
So here's how game theorists look at these data. 
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic. 
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. 
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week. 
But something kept on flickering before my eyes. 
And these were all incompatible. 
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase. 
So you have this little algal forest, and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae, mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish, so that the system recovers. 
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms, within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. 
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning. 
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components. 
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this." 
I have three girls and they just, they -- it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there. 
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. 
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men, using the second and third person masculine, the Koran includes women -- talking, for instance, of believing men and believing women, honorable men and honorable women. 
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. 
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. 
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice. 
I can't help it. I live here. 
But you know, these stories, and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest, basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me. 
And it's the same with nurses. 
But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone. 
For example, I told you that viruses have DNA. 
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices, they tried to kill. 
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne. 
This is a 10-kiloton bomb, slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think -- "news you could use" kind of concept here. 
We need three things. 
So who's the more sophisticated species? 
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. 
Man: Today you're invited to a peaceful march. 
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today. 
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand. 
AK: You want to say something about the breathing? 
When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification, I was faced with a real dilemma. 
Thank you. 
It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. 
And if she's doing that, because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor, she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice. 
As I went back, every time I went, I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married. 
But that's not right. 
So most Americans are not partisan, and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between, so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of Democrats and Republicans, we have even more overlap when you add in the independents. 
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible." 
And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence. 
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says, "give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. 
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now. 
Now let me give you an example from my act. 
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors, I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room. 
This does not have to happen. 
Chapter two starts in 1991. 
And more CO2 causes more warming. 
Thank you. 
Five dollars can save a life. 
And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime, now causes riots where people even die. 
James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here. 
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta, and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters. 
Would we see 544 airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months, or a year? 
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now? 
They stopped us from being inspired. 
There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know. 
The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space, and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe. 
Then I want to know -- now that I know what you're selling, tell me how you make money on it. 
It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time. 
Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France, people would just know. 
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains, so what is our brain going to do if we put that in? 
So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. 
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition, it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think -- I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it. 
That was the paintbrush. 
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation, existed in the 12th century. 
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers. 
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet. 
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice." 
And that's what we get, in fact. 
But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. 
So bats are also important for our health, to enable us to better understand how our genome functions. 
Now, having this conversation has been really hard, and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy, to increase the collaboration. 
It leaks. It's struck by lightning. 
("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!") ("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning, and now that she sees the posters that we're sending, she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, 
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind. 
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. 
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions. 
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover. 
Oh well, different story. 
And so nothing is going into the hackers. 
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. 
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. 
So the machine is computing. 
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. 
(Laughter) So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said, "You would never, ever design a rocket like that. 
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms. 
They have education programs. 
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it, not just with big businesses, but small businesses all over the country. 
So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source. 
This? It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon, the falls, and that's what I love the most about it. 
Most of the others either never responded back, said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me. 
And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D. 
Believing in each other, really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world, that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. 
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of play, number one, was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor, and number two was gambling. 
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it. 
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space. 
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. 
I'll try to spin a story about energy, and oil's a convenient starting place. 
So for example, I'm making images of you, but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain. 
One reason is the East Asian Model. 
I use natural reed, because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. 
Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years? 
Yet if you did, you would see something very, very similar to this. 
No search party was coming to look for these men. 
Our societies have never been so educated, have never been so energized, have never been so healthy, have never known so much, cared so much, or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local. 
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space, or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. 
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?" 
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough. 
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently: "The marriage suffered a setback in 1965, when the husband was killed by the wife." 
It matters because this is a democracy. 
They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation. 
This is a world in which there's no electricity, there's no money, there's no medical competence. 
But, if we put money into the core budget, we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent. 
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression. 
There has, however, been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces. 
The second thing you can say is, "Have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?" 
Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children? 
And certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country? 
It said Yorktown on the stern. 
(Laughter) I mean, I love the stuff. 
And by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team, is the fastest woman on earth. 
Richard Wurman: You did it. 
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey. 
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks. 
But at the time we had to throw in the towel. 
It's silent gesture. 
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem? 
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. 
Goodnight sweet opossum." 
So let's see what it looks like. 
By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey, the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found, and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo. 
One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high. 
(Applause) Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics. 
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse. 
This is a solvable issue. 
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years, have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood. 
And now that I've given lots of speeches, we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me, and they said, "Mr. Strickland, what an extraordinary story and what a great school. 
(Applause) I'm an artist and I cut books. 
If nothing else, at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through: sweaty palms, sleepless nights, a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. 
When we arrived there, after a month of traveling across the ice, and we'd got to them, but then I was not allowed to photograph them. 
Also, to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals. 
It's a big tooth." 
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research, was, that we were asking really the wrong question. 
We've got a climate crisis. 
Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol. 
The first building I built was 20 years ago. 
And I'm going to show them to you now, because they came out of very specific conditions. 
He didn't care for how much money this country has, or whether he would be able to ever finish this building, but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here. 
So I swam through the night, and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots. 
That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine. 
But more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning, something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. 
But that's just the beginning. 
It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now. 
Could we have the solutions? 
So what is altruism? 
It is always the same, never the same, endlessly fascinating. 
And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school. 
(Laughter) But I was a little disappointed -- pretty young -- but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California, and I went to Berkeley. 
But we should recognize that for many people in the world, they are a big deal. 
And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem. 
This is a tough one, because here I must take advantage of -- I switch it with the five of clubs. 
They say, "Well, it's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon. 
The process goes something like this. 
but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the paper people politics. 
Really, very important -- we need to listen to each other. 
so that each of us -- explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef -- can turn up the lights in their own way. 
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. 
You love, or you don't love. 
So now the question is: if we get that much richer, how much social progress are we going to get? 
And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk. 
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse than we think, faster than we think. 
So what we had to do in order to begin was not only to write law review articles and teach classes, write books, but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case. 
Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13? 
He did a lot of this work in the '60s, and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back. 
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one! 
And pretty soon, they began shipping that coal, ton by ton, rail car by rail car, boatload by boatload, back to China and elsewhere around the world. 
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. 
So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle. 
They were key in our culture and our economy. 
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors. 
Now the big brain did this also with cooking. 
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions? 
(Laughter) But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar, because he is actually the Chinese character for "people." 
Now he's put together some thoughts: About half of that he'll cut, another half, perhaps in a very complex set of steps, taxes will be approved. 
Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection. 
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing, and how that should happen. 
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. 
So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer. 
The question is: what's next? 
["Work saves a man from three great evils: boredom, vice and need." — Voltaire] So with these challenges, what do we do about them? 
So onto Google Maps we go, and we start looking through literally every single bridge. 
You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. 
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing, the future of Africa, this conference -- what connections can we make, if any, between them? 
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. 
That's like me telling you, "Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?" 
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table, it all takes place in the private sector. 
We are now taking control of our own evolution. 
Is it like gravity, which is the same everywhere in the universe, or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them? 
One of the great mistakes, I think, of economics is it fails to understand that what something is, whether it's retirement, unemployment, cost, is a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning. 
"I already have," she told me. 
Well it's extraordinary. 
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it? 
Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. 
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola. 
So what kind of science can we have? 
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago. 
There's all kinds of activity. 
(Laughter) It is. It's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel. 
It was at that moment, in that very small town of 30,000 or so, that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. 
And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read, and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you. 
What about a society today? 
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford, one lakh car, $2,000 car." 
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. 
All of a sudden, the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers. 
And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us. 
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. 
We buy it for our kids. 
Good news: Chariot's coming. 
Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. 
So, I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. 
There was gas rationing in 1973. 
And let me tell you this story. 
The kid had no patience for him. 
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. 
What time of life had they started school? 
And like all the dolphins in our community, we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin, and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time. 
She may be interested in providing local services to her community: babysitting, local deliveries, pet care. 
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really. 
(Laughter) I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here." 
But could you go a little further? 
We use this idea called self-assembly. 
All right, this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in. 
It was just like that, because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous politicians, they were just like us. 
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. 
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said, "Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?" 
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe, but not to each other because we compete with each other all time. 
You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights. 
I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing. 
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people. 
Meaning: The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby. 
And we persisted, and we got 450 guys growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars, and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received. 
Now what I believe is going on is that the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt. 
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon, all of them single soon after taking home that statue. 
We need Coke to work with Pepsi. 
In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the Earth, you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn't consistent with the age of the Earth implied by the account in Genesis. 
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere. 
(Applause) (Music) ♫ Here we stand ♫ ♫ Like an Adam and an Eve ♫ ♫ Waterfalls ♫ ♫ The Garden of Eden ♫ ♫ Two fools in love ♫ ♫ So beautiful and strong ♫ ♫ Birds in the trees ♫ ♫ Are smiling upon them ♫ ♫ From the age of the dinosaurs ♫ ♫ Cars would run on gasoline ♫ ♫ Where? Where have they gone? ♫ ♫ Now, there's nothing but flowers ♫ ♫ This was a factory ♫ ♫Now there are mountains and rivers ♫ ♫ You got it, you got it ♫ ♫ We caught a rattlesnake ♫ 
The reality, now here is something important. 
Now wall switches, we all know, fail. 
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. 
There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years. 
Again, it's got technology -- it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head. 
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24 who received the assignment to draw the prophet -- 12 of them refused. Did you know that? 
Texting has a 100 percent open rate. 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. 
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system, full of runaway positive feedbacks, hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points. 
And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace, maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post-it notes. It’s pretty barren. 
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will, but capable of only two ideas. 
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session. 
What can we actually do? 
But I also am in the fueling business. 
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue. 
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable. 
I want to warn you about that. 
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid? 
This is the strange inversion. 
Developmentally, these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement, in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials, in both of these conditions. 
And by the way, please don't try this technique at home. 
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication, is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement, but with serenity. 
There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus. 
2,438 pages. 
But only in the last 120 years people started, or people knew more and more how to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon, or in fact, natural control phenomenon, to their own needs. 
And of course I did. 
And I set up Kanchi, because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant, because disability is like the elephant in the room. 
Everywhere I went, I felt at home. 
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag. 
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways. 
Thank you very much. 
So the whole "Hells and Heavens" is about free will and determinism. 
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet. 
And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing. 
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet, still, over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV. 
Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. 
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7, but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks, or as we call them, factors. 
And each case is different. 
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. 
But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. 
In addition to those levers, we could talk about other ways of solving this issue, namely, we could reduce demand, and that means reducing population — I'm not sure how to do that — or reducing per capita consumption. 
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends. 
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this. 
This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics, for example cholera. 
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. 
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about the power of, and importance of, independent media than I could say in an hour. 
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman. 
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. 
The fact that the laughter works, it gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation, into a funny situation, into what we're actually enjoying there, and I think that's a really interesting use, and it's actually happening all the time. 
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat. 
(Music) Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. 
And I'm going to talk about HIV today, about the deaths, about the stigma. 
For some reason, she has aphasia, which is difficulty with communication. 
SS: Well, there's certainly more dialogue, which is great. 
Of course, the more you go in the past, the less information you will have. 
It's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit. 
So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. 
Okay, I'm going to sort you out. 
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. 
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant -- that's why, often in these glamour shots, the person is not looking at the audience, it's why sunglasses are glamorous -- but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. 
(Video) Boy: How about this? 
Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion. 
The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information -- from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.

I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. 
That is the real world, and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization, we will increasingly not only risk the failure to address all of these transnational problems, but we will risk losing democracy itself, locked up in the old nation-state box, unable to address global problems democratically.

And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. 
And so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible." 
(Laughter) It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine? 
Human beings are a social species. 
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. 
And indeed, if you look further down the list, I don't have the slide here, you will see something that made me very happy indeed, that Kenya is in the top 30, and that demonstrates one very, very important thing. 
Chimborazo! 
This kind of data can become routine. 
And it's one that gets very little attention. 
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power, we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas, and we gave them this diagram. 
The USDA allows this. 
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment. 
(Applause) This song is called "Farther than the Sun." 
Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds.

The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. 
And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women. 
Then we can start to use cells. 
Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas, well, you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal.

If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away. 
It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet.

But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call. 
(Laughter) "'I give life and I take it away. 
They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection, stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me, and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read. 
The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica, where it was boarded onto a freighter, shipped across the tropics to California, unloaded, put on a truck, driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado, where, as we speak, scientists are now slicing this material up for samples, for analysis, to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. 
One, two, three! 
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it." 
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons. 
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. 
The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values. 
So as a result, my father sent me to America. 
Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon. 
Me, I have strictly no power to change anything. 
This works until you invent newspapers. 
Now, why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality? 
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa! 
Now most of you, when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving, instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. 
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years. 
And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock. 
I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. 
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure. 
All of this is possible, if we each contribute to this fight. 
I want to share some of that story with you, but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim-majority societies. 
If they disappear, so do we. 
What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree, is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. 
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. 
But this is what it looks like, and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles. 
You may have guessed by now, I did not light myself on fire. 
I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together, and this is my stop. 
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. 
And finally, there's deforestation, and there's emission of methane from agriculture. 
And you see that in humans, because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called. 
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work. 
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies. 
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things? 
That's a guess. 
We have to do good buildings. 
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity. 
But what I've been doing -- when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house. 
I think I can do that. 
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers, and this charismatic snake, the king cobra. 
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation. 
And People magazine, I thought, got probably the best shot. 
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans, where they face severe punishment. 
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. 
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. 
It's just really about combining different realities. 
Thank you very much. 
And so I said, "Sure." 
This is when its foot's in the air. 
Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit, but it works. So as long as some people like to share as their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out. 
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital, you buy a different one for children, you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything, and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. 
And here is another five seconds of repose, is my mantra. Form and function. 
They talk about it. They've sanitized it. 
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people, under 30 years old. 
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night. 
I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities. 
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one; you get the big one and if you don't like that, how about the little one? 
Here is the critical difference between these: LOLcats is communal value. 
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 
That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones, there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. 
MP: Nope. Nothing's in my pockets. Nurse: Okay. 
They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history. 
So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..." 
CA: Well, it's been incredible to have you here. 
Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it? 
Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common, and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people. 
Yes, there are subtle differences here, but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line, without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade-off between going as fast as possible in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here. 
These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me, and I kind of figured it out. 
He spent five years in solitary, and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin, and he's articulate and he's rather easy on the eyes because he's buff. 
The broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan. 
(Laughter) Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. 
Now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears. 
Again you can see, this is a building of the Free University in Berlin and it was designed by Foster and Partners. 
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle, I made him "The Uncle Phone." 
I did this building in Japan. 
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. 
He coined the term "reverse fishing license." 
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason, and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either. 
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size. 
And I knew I could do it. 
The other thing that the early man invented was fire. 
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary, and be extracted and tell us who was there. 
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. 
Can you quantify your openness? 
They're like Golden Retrievers. 
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. 
And countries with Islam as the majority religion, all of them almost had six to seven children per woman, irregardless of the income level. 
They clean up carcasses right to the bone. 
(Laughter) That's very risky. 
But many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind and the spirit. 
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page: You can go in there and change it, but so can other people. 
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market. 
And this region, it's a very small region -- it's less than one millimeter. 
Basically, a human body is a conversation going on, both within the cells and between the cells, and they're telling each other to grow and to die, and when you're sick, something's gone wrong with that conversation. 
They need you to move at their rhythm. 
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect. 
This guy specializes in pit vipers. 
Encouragement seems to be the key. 
Throughout this whole thing, making toys, I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science. 
I think of this as the place of imagination, of potential, but what are its qualities? 
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent, much of what you have seen here. 
You must stop. Stop. 
So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive. 
Again, another medical example here. 
And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats, or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there, and enjoying what scuba divers do. 
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly. 
It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture, about 50,000 people, one of the first that was hit by the wave. 
(Applause) Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine. 
(Laughter) And it's not completely gratuitous, because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out. 
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system. 
We built the hardware and the software. 
And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this. 
So far, this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Eerie a foot deep. 
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village. 
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor. 
Let me show you how far you can do that. 
A very common public design done in the '50s. 
(Shouting) Who is she? 
I can't believe that these people, years after my brother had died, helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on years ago, worked or not. 
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN. 
(Video) Hilma: I found out when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up. 
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. 
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience, and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. 
Of course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose. 
(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope, hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. 
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book. 
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs, whatever they were, were very big. 
So I looked, and like the thousands of people that had tried before, I found nothing. 
And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me." 
But the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. 
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. 
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part, so I stayed alone with the cosmos. 
But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so. 
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?" 
Here is their first big public announcement. 
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador, which has some of the least well protected? 
We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true. 
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing. 
And I remember it really well, because I don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter) All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness. 
And what are you going to do, like, cut back on paper clips or something? No. 
I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India, Pakistan, from Britain, and I said, "Wow." Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. 
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives. 
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof, jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo. 
These are little mechanical computers. 
And then sometimes you get this. 
And Beijerinck's discovery, this was not something that occurred 500 years ago. 
(Applause) Next is a term -- I do it quick. I call this stealing. 
(Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. 
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household. 
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer, the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery. 
First of all, we have all these things in our hands. 
Can you spot the difference? 
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying. 
For example, I could never pitch my voice that high to sing. 
So we have these stars going around in circles like this. 
I'd say, watch any successful well-written, family-friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. 
On October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium, and explains his situation. 
Raw data. 
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations. 
And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA. 
Only 90 days after this, arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred. 
Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio. 
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab, and which show you, in a living brain, the reconstruction of that brain. 
How engaged you are. 
With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. 
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites. 
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. 
Now, these four examples I have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem, and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. 
It's just wrong. 
The reason for it, in part, was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable. 
The Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation, then there can be no more transformative experience. 
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be, I would've probably said, a couple of percent. 
So here it is, a crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TEDTalks at the value of $99.50: "Why the worry? I'd rather wonder." 
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. 
Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana, and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight. 
Take any cognitive domain you want, memory, motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law, getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on, put people into functional MRI devices, and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity. 
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub, we put a disco where you could dance, and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to, and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island. 
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best? 
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. 
We cut, we dry and we packed them, we mounted them on a folder. 
The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. 
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. 
But it's not just about people; it's about lifestyles. 
This came out in 2008, which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. 
Out of a population of 150,000, only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk. 
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. 
In fact, one of them, he was Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County, so they're not, you never know who you're dealing with. 
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world. 
But there's a middle ground, too. 
Granted, we don't have everything in between, because some of the data is hard to get. 
Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause) But usually, you can't know. You never know. 
CA: Of your national revenue. 
So 144,000 are called Lester, which means about .05 percent is named Lester. 
The question is: Is any of this true for cities and companies? 
That's where their consumers come from. 
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. 
In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you. 
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator. 
I just did a seven-country solo tour. 
(Laughter) And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task. 
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. 
We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say, "Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?" 
I started with improvisation, in a particular form of improvisation called theater games, which had one rule, which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society. 
(Applause) It's a quite amazing development which has happened. 
So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone, except for this metal piece. 
I said, "Great. What do you do?" 
It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. 
So, this was the contents page originally. 
It's beautiful and it's functional. 
And this sometimes went on for hours. 
So have a nice Christmas, and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye. 
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?" 
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy, and at every moment, different partisans saying, "Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse," and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy. 
The confronting, not so much. 
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness, do you feel dreadful. 
I spent about eight months working on these profiles. 
I've met some dough eaters, but -- it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life. 
And it's expanding. 
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks. 
And I want to share with you my latest art project. 
You get this really huge power out of it. 
I played with it in the evening. 
Children want to make things. Children want to do things. 
They start as little eggs, and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. 
To the contrary, we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests, which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups, the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. 
The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. 
So you can eat the same amount of food, but you’ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. 
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here," and we say, "That's not part of my plan," then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. 
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. 
I was at a wall." 
(Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues, there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV. 
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. 
So, you know, that's my last message to you. 
While laying there dying, all he could say was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away." 
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity. 
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them. 
But they have qualities we'd all recognize. 
There's some large companies that have seen this vision, that are doing large-scale digitization, but they're locking up the public domain. 
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways, it was possible to pick one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful and try it out. 
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air. 
Nothing good can come of this. 
It's a moment when people think about who they are, their place in society, and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology. 
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods. 
And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. 
CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross? 
(Laughter) In reality, the kids who were told what to do, whether by Miss Smith or their mothers, were actually given the very same activity, which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen. 
A lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford, and actually slightly bigger than that. 
Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's and large numbers of A.P. credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors. 
And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really. 
If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language, the present and the future, you speak about them identically. 
And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education. 
Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne. 
Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here. 
Anything different about the two patterns? 
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens. 
(Laughter) So we have these very multinational, global, mobile crews on ships. 
Part of me is just waiting to let go. 
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in. 
I couldn't understand the starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people. 
It's the relationship -- it's the dynamics between the systems -- which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist. 
And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us. 
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. 
Armor goes this way. 
So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. 
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children, your coworkers, your friends and family. 
So what happens to all these toxins when we die? 
Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted, never to appear again. 
As a teenager, he faced the invasion of his country, and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country. 
All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. 
I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books, but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it, and wonder what was happening, wonder why, and think about the material of the book. 
And I thought, "Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body?" 
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life: questions like, "What is worth living for?" 
Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on. 
They have different electrical and magnetic properties. 
'This is the real me,' I announced, waving my arms above my head. 
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000 due to improvements. 
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture. 
What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very, very enterprising. 
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo. 
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas, but do not make a flower arrangement without a license, because that will land you in jail. 
They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking. 
Me and you, the investments we are going to be making, the investments the world is going to be making -- that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa. 
(Laughter) And if there is a struggle for life, such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on. 
In our area, in furnishings, they're sort of way at the top. 
(Applause) They do lots of inconsistent things. 
And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear], and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. 
Now the same insights can also be exploited -- with respect to networks -- can also be exploited in other ways, for example, in the use of targeting specific people for interventions. 
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever, so it's just not true. 
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code, and this was Bamana sand divination. 
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders. 
And to make the project affordable, we focused our energy. 
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model. 
As a result, in the Russian far east today, which is twice the size of India, you have exactly six million Russians. 
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients, but now this will change. 
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. 
The first is this: We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives, if you give people more choice, if you put them in the driving seat, then actually, you can create a stronger and better society. 
This is just one example. 
That looks like this. 
And it works almost every time. 
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine. 
We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. 
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world, and just dumping product and selling into the markets. 
But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success into mastery? 
I'm not sure I really even want it to. 
(Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. 
So this is possible. We can do it. 
So these 20-somethings created an alternative health care system, where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's injured, a car would show up, it would pick them up, take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get medical treatment, as opposed to being executed. 
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on. 
So all around the world people are doing the same thing. 
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi. 
It's an extraordinarily close correlation. 
But what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in direction, going in a different way. 
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. 
They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. 
The first, to my mind, is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived." 
It doesn't do any damage, but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees. 
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you. 
We thought she was going to die. 
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage. 
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all, and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains, and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo, and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim, like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky. 
And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. 
If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me. 
So, what are the solutions? 
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. 
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken. 
So I launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon. 
They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma, and we developed concepts of collective action, basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table, explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing, and to make a long story short, we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. 
There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. 
They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman, who said to them, "You fought not only the enemy but prejudice, and you won." 
Matters of principle aside, practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground. 
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. 
Not because it's a job, not because it's a career, but because it's a calling. 
So here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc. 
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen, for having respect for dignity, and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world. 
So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it. 
The company itself, Oxitec, we've been working for the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company. 
They'll want the new release. 
Did I mention they're gorgeous? 
It was an evening dive. 
You think, "Ha, ha, ha. 
And what was remarkable about this day is, by sheer coincidence, one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. 
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better. 
We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self, a truer self, is born. 
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb. 
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. 
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that. 
Why? To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into. 
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered, unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. 
(Laughter) So to address this problem, I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K. 
Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people, but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion. 
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating, and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and out of this process innovation comes product innovations, which are then marketed around the world. 
Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? 
And it's specifically algorithms, which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. 
If the universe is not a fluctuation, why did the early universe have a low entropy? 
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. 
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle." 
There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. 
When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them. 
I don't doubt that that plays some role, but what I want to convince you of today is that there's something else going on. 
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids. 
Saying, not what are the situations, but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them, how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. 
"For sale: White trash compactor." 
Why has the idea spread? 
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers. 
Nobody? One? How about 10 years? 
There are not that many things on earth that are "almost everything." 
Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design. 
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment, and we set up a field site at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms. 
Millions of women live like this today. 
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there. 
And people are not stupid; they don't cooperate. 
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. 
It turns out that, whenever you have that system, weird stuff happens, and you in Los Angeles probably know this better than anyone. 
They're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible. 
I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. 
We think we have a problem of people saving too much. 
It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it. 
But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology, an interface to do two-way communication, and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. 
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters. 
Its liver expands by eight times. 
It's basically why you need the qubit, because it only has two ideas. 
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. 
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you. 
Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination. 
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates. 
Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously, the child got up and said, "Eat." 
Shut it down at once." 
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way, but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us. 
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. 
Did you learn to wash your hands in school? 
So I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data. 
(Applause) I'd like to start with a short story. 
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it, and so that's what I had to go for. 
In fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... 
Communication technologies: 50 different ways to measure this, the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet. 
What can you do? 
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes, but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing. 
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland, and it's all related to the oil. 
So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler. 
As a body architect, I've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want. 
There's a saying in the world of information science: ultimately everybody will know everything. 
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically, there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. 
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. 
Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power, and by the way, this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis, and that's probably going to get steeper. 
And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it. 
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes. 
It's cool for me. 
It's about 30 degrees outside. 
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say, dealing with electricity production, which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions. 
But here's the thing: The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. 
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India? 
Who's going to get enough out of the world? 
(Laughter) And this is on the Fourth of July. 
So you can see the surface of every single swatch -- like in this picture of Chuck Close. 
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. 
Thank you. 
(Kiss) Charles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning, there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf, has in this world in terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities. 
(Laughter) All I wanted to do was to get better, and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. 
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. 
The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water, but rather salt that's melted. 
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? 
Where do they get their reproductive resources? 
In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. 
They were too young to survive without their mother. 
And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. 
It's almost more important than their eyesight. 
So every time you see a concrete jungle like that, what you've got to do is find open spaces. 
(Piano notes) You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek. 
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things. 
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No." 
And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall, size it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height. 
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers, it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses. 
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation. 
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay. 
Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. 
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view. 
These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. 
(Music) So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music. 
And the electrons can only be in particular places. 
We actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn: Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence. 
Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface. 
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent. 
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. 
So I decided to make these very simple renderings, that at first they are taken as a line drawing -- you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire. 
Sorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet. 
We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. 
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky. 
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced that another world is possible -- a world where no one would ever need a forger. 
My body was often in the way. 
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital. 
And we actually know where Brain came from. 
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right? 
Now JPL, NASA and Boeing, before they will hire a research and development problem solver -- even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech -- if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life, played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well. 
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center. 
It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. 
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. 
Because if I want evolution, I need containers to compete. 
(Applause) Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces. 
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. 
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch. 
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. 
So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point, now four times smaller, and so forth. 
That costs about 100 dollars. 
That is my invention. 
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price. 
Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed. 
Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage, chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. 
History suggests not. 
But as I mentioned at the start, in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging, showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics. 
And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock." 
But I think we can do both at the same time here. 
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know, you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs. 
That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. 
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one. 
Somebody once said, Al Qaeda does not have a return address, so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon, what's the response, and to whom is the response? 
It penetrates the mucosa. 
It's about a tenth of a millimeter. 
It's very difficult to start a private university. 
So we have an in-built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity. 
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers, who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. 
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary. 
And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills, somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school, which is putting information and dogma into them, get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book, think broadly or creative. They can be. 
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle. 
So let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value. 
And one of those I'd like to share with you today. 
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular, but also Chile, which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life, there's a very bright future indeed. 
You see the timeline on the top. 
Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians. 
And I would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere. 
AB: Indeed. 
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard, in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard. 
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing, I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast, and I blinded myself in one eye. 
Can you imagine? It's very symbolic. 
And so it is with Archimedes, the great Greek mathematician. 
And I'm talking about the very end. 
And their actions are fantastic. 
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two. 
It is our light, and not our darkness, that frightens us." 
You ask a question, you write down some numbers, and you get yourself an answer. 
This is all happening automatically in the simulation. 
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave, the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing? 
And we've reached the point where we've realized, as doctors, we can't know it all. 
I mean, take the question of East Asia. 
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types. 
When thinking about choices, I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally. 
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. 
It was important not to look at those guns. 
And the way the drug gets tested is through a series of, basically, experiments, through these large, they're called trials, that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things. 
This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. 
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet. 
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities, and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics, and I see part of my job today, the reason for being here, not just to campaign for my party, but for politics, and the role it can play for the better in our lives. 
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing with cultural issues, and this is, I love this Klimt painting, because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here, which is clearly the separation of death from the living, and the fear — Like, if you actually look, there's one woman there who has her eyes open. 
He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots, so as not to harm them. 
So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling, which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing, because it means it's a sealed system. 
I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms, life uses computation to do that. 
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices, and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves, which means the skeleton's flexible. 
And in fact, the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we're digitizing per day is really, really large. 
If you take programmers, you know, the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation. 
Thank you. 
And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist, can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken. 
CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ? 
But in truth, what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot, like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij, where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur of recycled refrigerator parts, as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it. 
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that. 
People will forget their wisdom. 
the air force's 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb, which didn't need a bombsight at all. 
If I push these together, the light turns off. 
Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. 
A metaphor will serve here: Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science, the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout the frontiers, they cut the pathways, they raise the buildings along the way. 
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money, too much need -- and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work. 
"What I Will" I will not dance to your war drum. 
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally -- spell it for me. 
So what we do with this is, for example, we can look at two patients, one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug, and ask, "What's going on differently inside of them?" 
We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen. 
There's such a disconnect. 
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex, are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight." 
We kicked his bed so that he could see out. 
Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. 
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things. 
Now this is a free app on the App Store, so if any of you guys had this app on your phones, we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. 
And I think most of us will agree, well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. 
But partly, we want to make the world a better place, and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation, and we're in the process of setting that up. 
At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash. 
They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up, both my mother and father would always say to me, it's really important that you always remember two things. 
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. 
The first is -- death is a big problem. 
(Applause) A year ago, I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing, that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. 
There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information, and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. 
In the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. 
And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. 
So I'm going to show you a factoid. 
(Laughter) And then we went to a fish restaurant, and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us, and he came up and my mother said, "Do you have any specials, young man?" 
It can happen that these two protons can hop over. 
I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. 
But will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man? 
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system, and we have global decisions to make in this system, decisions about climate, about finance systems, about resources. And think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house, we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you, but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it. 
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. 
And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain. 
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is, and then, if there's so much video motion, it will then tell the balloon to pop. 
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. 
This is the actual catacombs in Paris. 
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever. 
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes, aromatic plants and so on. 
So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something, and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it, they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory and they're holding onto memory? Yeah? 
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT, I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter) So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. 
Nothing else. 
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families, if you will, of the H5N1 viral tree with branches in them, and with different attributes that are worrying. 
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?) Yeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?) We didn't fly it into the Pacific. 
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. 
That was fascinating. 
They were able to disable the brakes. 
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional. 
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary. 
In the first phase of this testing, which is called testing for toxicity, it's called Phase I. 
You know, what happens if you give somebody a toy planet, and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it, what could they discover? What might they learn on this? 
I'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side. 
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers. 
Do you mind if we do something completely different? 
I call this process "patternicity" -- that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise. 
Little did I know, lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that I'd been born at the right place and the right time, that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution. 
Let's start with leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, the most common cancer of children. 
If you think this isn't as good... 
These are all handmade. 
(Laughter) So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness? 
(Applause) Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city, three days after the earthquake. 
The other favorite, if you like, solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. 
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints. 
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children." 
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds. 
So, Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray. 
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life, but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything; I'm just not going to die." 
They are in the birthing rooms. 
Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?" 
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. 
Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives. 
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. 
(Bugle sound) There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it. 
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh. 
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth. 
She was, of course, done up for the occasion, but this was a woman in great physical distress. 
They used it to build an information superhighway, gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution, and to create jobs in their economy. 
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. 
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements. 
They are more expensive in places like North America. 
It's funded by foundations. 
And I went away. 
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda, and we never did. 
We begin separating everything into good versus evil. 
In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it. 
So what we have now -- or a world without reserves -- is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit. 
And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting. 
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds. 
You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes, they're burnt limestone -- to empower the coca leaf, to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. 
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't. 
That started our 15-year quest to get here. 
If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it. 
Then we were victims of the French. 
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. 
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind. 
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. 
Sounds great, right? 
And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there. 
The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong. 
Why did I take the risk? 
For you, it's your call. 
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down. 
So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death, they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them, and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever. 
Jobs. 
We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools. 
I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. 
It seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived, a small school has opened. 
The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible. 
So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little mental dance, a little, in this little one minute, so what I'd love you to do is imagine, you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you. 
This is a bleached coral, coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino. 
But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. 
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know. 
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close, odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles, elephants. 
Allow a new city to be built up there. 
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. 
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago. 
(Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes. 
We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children. 
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe, if the officer is dishonest, you get a huge payoff of going free. 
But that's not the hard part." 
That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining, games like hide-and-seek, and poker. 
We can do it without harming any tissue. 
It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But that day, when I asked that question, I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right, when in fact it's a privilege. 
In one month, we completed nine classrooms, over 500 square meters. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty? 
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee. 
For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake, went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle. 
(Laughter) All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars." 
That's it, thank you. 
We often hear about cyber activism, how people are getting more active because of the Internet. 
What if, Plato thought, ethics was like math? 
And the results have great data. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. 
So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin. 
I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research -- we just wondered how they climbed up something -- can lead to things that you could never imagine. 
This is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. 
I had to hook it up to a computer, so I couldn't just train it anywhere. 
That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. 
And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering, I just felt like a movie star. 
But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. 
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart, China was the world's high-technology leader. 
And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. 
Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling. 
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. 
(Laughter) Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor? 
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things, that you'll see a lot more of. 
It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence. 
And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. 
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate? 
The movie began. 
The other thing is, batteries suck too. 
So the tenor of education has changed. 
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent of people who don't want to do that. 
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust, to build an environment where raw data could be stored, and where it could be accessed and manipulated, where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient. 
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before? 
It's the stigma inside of others, it's the shame, it's the embarrassment, it's the disapproving look on a friend's face, it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak, it's the comments that you're crazy. 
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this, and after he looked at this reenactment, he turned to me and he says, "Is there anything else you want me to look at?" 
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. 
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound. 
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career. 
I think that's what all this is pointing at. 
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years. 
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter. 
And if you're an educator in any way, again, look at how religions are spreading ideas. 
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town, but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site of the destruction. 
It's the National Ignition Facility. 
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine." 
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium? 
This is Samuel. He's a farmer. 
At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. 
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. 
God no, it was therapy. 
Oh, we did. 
And the architect, Jim Polshek, essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on. 
So let's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side. 
I was 17. 
And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective, we're going to be able to manage this process. 
That was the message. That was the experiment. 
Golly, I'm just totally losing it. 
(Laughter) Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. 
And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem. 
(Applause) (Piano) [The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] [We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.] [We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] 
First of all, if you can, don't fight the patent, fight the infringement. 
The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania -- it's not up to me to say also like Greece -- can be fought only by modernization. 
(Applause) Salaam alaikum. 
And then she would simply put her hand out and say, "Can you give me some?" 
And this is about good taste, good traditions. 
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador. 
(Frequency) Thank you. (Applause) It's okay to applaud the laws of physics, but essentially what's happening here -- (Laughter) -- is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane, creating a visible waveform, and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency, and the height is showing us amplitude. 
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. 
But something is definitely lost: tradition, a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity. 
So here's the video. 
These are complex issues. 
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person. 
You bring in science, and it ruins the magic." 
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. 
No to barrier walls. On February 5th, concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters. 
It leaks horribly. 
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow. 
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not." 
I had to put on sunscreen. 
You can look at it online. 
We saw all kinds of donated equipment. 
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. 
And this thing -- species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever. 
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence, the lack of partnership between NGOs, campaign groups, civil society organizations and multinational companies. 
We have this ability to make things, to grasp things with our hands. 
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said, "We're really serious about this," but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought, okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product, maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious. 
(Laughter) I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine, but to share this among your peers is something different. 
When Connecticut adopted this system, in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only. 
But he said, "We will partner with you, but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work." 
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. 
And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together, the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater. 
Today, their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent. 
They're in the crowd, and the crowd is switching on lights, and we can see them for the first time, not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers, but as individuals we can learn from. 
But I had a lot of fun. 
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty. 
So I just want to conclude with the following words. 
OK, here we go. 
Needless to say, I did not get a call from her. 
How does Dorothy win her movie? 
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location. 
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world, going to have to lose everything that we love. 
Well, to quote: "The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception. 
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. 
This next chart looks at more recent data. 
In 2008, one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow. 
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. 
Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of iPods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals, dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society. 
Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS. 
And what that means is, you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here. 
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go. 
If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up, you have a puddle. 
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis, but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. 
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have. 
So when the fish control the urchin population, the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium. 
And if you let time go by, it kind of softens and smooths the edges. 
I was there to report on that story in cartoons. 
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous, we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat, which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does. 
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that. 
One is the recession -- that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value -- so starting to align the value with the true cost. 
After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed. 
It appears that it may not always be that way. 
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class. 
And in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense. 
We're really good at talking about material things, but we're really bad at talking about emotions. 
And most importantly, if the staircase is real, it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life. 
This is in 1960. 
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films, "Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana" and "Good Night and Good Luck." 
So I wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces, and the simplest way to do it, at the time, was to model myself. 
We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR, no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive. 
Do you love being read to? 
And in the end, you got so quick, that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee" were no problem, were they? 
They belonged to boys. 
(Laughter) And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap." 
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes. 
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. 
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets, but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know. 
Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people. 
As these carcasses sink, they provide a feast to some 400-odd species, including the eel-shaped, slime-producing hagfish. 
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed, the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground. 
Here's what he had to say. 
RP: So now, Samantha can say this. 
Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story. 
The idea is actually relatively simple. 
And so the backstory of The 99 takes place in 1258, which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. 
This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. 
There are over 40,000 described species of spiders. 
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course, all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point, will die in intensive care. 
Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company, but Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. 
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. 
Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge. 
And that's changed, because we've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience. 
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. 
It's about stimulation. 
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read. 
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. 
We know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies. 
Anybody? Anybody? Yeah! 
In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent. 
So I showed him. 
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days. 
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation, so we can tackle this problem together. 
I don't have a pointer here, but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid? 
If either of them be unwilling, the act is an offense, totally different in its nature of effects. 
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means. 
So, taxi journeys might be one example. 
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search this data? How do I process this data?" 
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades. 
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners. 
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go, and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out. 
Openness is about collaboration. 
(Laughter) And there is another example: aphids. 
They would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car. 
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point. 
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form, because of all this gravitational attraction. 
So it's very promising, actually. 
Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone. 
When something natural, something that's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste, or even a piece of paper, when something natural ends up in the natural environment, it degrades normally. 
You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities, I'll start losing cities here. 
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing -- or try not get stuck behind the computer all day. 
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal, the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it. 
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones. 
Well, to conclude, I can say that we made a material using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. 
But there's one big question left: do they have a language, and if so, what are they talking about? 
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption. 
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it. 
The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. 
Well, it has its pluses and minuses. 
So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. 
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings, I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system; every window has an air conditioner in it. 
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea. 
And looking globally as well, deaths are also starting to fall. 
That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear]. 
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. 
Reserves are like savings accounts. 
He's number 76 in the picture. 
So, for example, when you touch a pencil, microbial exchange happens. 
Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy -- great, big philosophy kind of an organization -- I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know. 
But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self-doubt, and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are, how inspiring and delightful and really, truly the most completely ..." 
Pain is 120. 
So let's start with the obvious: Many of us don't like the needle and syringe. 
Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about gallons per mile. 
Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? 
I said, "No." 
The pity is that our cities, like New Delhi and Bombay, do not have a 24-hour water supply. 
It leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up, just like that, at the slightest underachievement. 
I don't know where it comes from. 
So let me begin by first of all giving a very, very brief history of time, if I may indulge. 
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to. 
They handcuffed him to a chair, and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail, then left him there to bleed to death. 
There's something in New York City. 
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman. 
So what if you've targeted cells? 
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. 
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right? 
But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between, because it's a mechanical force. 
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration. 
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. 
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year. 
But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization, infects between 50 and 100 million people every year, so that's equivalent to the whole of the population of the U.K. being infected every year. 
And not long after I got my cochlear implant, I started learning how to play piano. 
So what are my take-home messages from my talk today? 
The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base. 
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen, then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners. 
This is now a little tiny patch. 
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine. 
That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home, does most of your work. 
If we called valedictorian a "white knight paladin level 20," I think people would probably work a lot harder. 
These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. 
And combined, this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year, last year, than in the year 2000. 
For the first time, this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees. 
But I'm not kidding about some of this, and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. 
There are many health issues as well. 
I did that twice, and I went broke. 
These are the descendants of Hans Frank who was Hitler's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied Poland. 
(Laughter) I just want to give you a quick overview. 
And I was stuck, because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. 
BF: Thank you, that's it. 
It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors. 
And collectively, we really didn't know if we could pull this off. 
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. 
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right? 
Which is right? 
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology. 
In a way, it's a toy, no? 
And over the next 18 years have almost tripled. 
And one of the the cutting-edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. 
And then a jumpmaster comes, and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. 
It's simply not sustainable. 
9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day, and it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing. 
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting." 
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. 
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly, does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop and ends up on the wire behind me. 
(Music) Text: You can say a jury is corrupt. 
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right? 
And, thank God, you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth. 
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. 
Years after he's had these drugs, I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva, including some positive side effects that came from other drugs, were making his constipation worse. 
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus. 
And what happens is that we mix these strands together. 
It's that shape because the helium has to expand. 
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan? 
But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you? 
The salesmen were students from my lab. 
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved. 
I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery. 
So you go to the literature. (Laughter) Maybe you're familiar with this literature. 
And then our mothers tell us, "Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over. 
He arrives on the small hill, dripping with water. 
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. 
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular, academic, scientist types. 
In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. 
Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. 
Why do we have them? Well, as I said, we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. 
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news. 
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity. 
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. 
The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. 
This is the other side of the things that we like. 
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology -- and I'll talk about those more in a moment. 
It's incredibly important, those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance, hadn't spent that money in Darfur, but it's not a way to live. 
If we changed so much, something must have happened. 
But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship. 
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats. 
Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris, or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally, much like a penis, and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. 
I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision. 
They tracked these on a separate website. 
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem, a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets. 
And so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse, you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. 
(Laughter) Behold, patent infringement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not stationary. 
Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody, you know, you have a producing partner. Or, you know, again, validation. 
In the first panel, we see the moment of creation. 
And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale. 
Effectively you would have something like this. 
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it, but from my senses' point of view, that is combined together into one source of information. 
But this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity, growing qualitatively, not quantitatively. 
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead. 
Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us? 
They were a highly intelligent species. 
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases. 
If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed, if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge, it would be half that size still. 
And so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies. 
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. 
Being human is an art form. 
Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world. 
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. 
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. 
This software allows interactive use, so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. 
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. 
Well, of course, there is globalization, technology, communications, all that stuff, which we'll talk about a little bit later. 
But the full math version takes a little while, so there is another one. 
So that's why I've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours. 
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here. 
Well, I really care about 1980 because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. 
We are learning about how dense proximity can be. 
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues, whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be. 
Oh, for the love of God. 
(Laughter) He gets up there and then he ... comes back up. 
A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. 
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims. 
This is the first message I ever got from Nico. 
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. 
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you, and they invited us to the Hamptons. 
That was like, we considered that super cool. 
It's brand new. 
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. 
And it's very important to have political reforms, to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. 
But nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. 
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis, it will create a disc of light that we can control. 
And he said, "As God as my witness, I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it. 
Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah? 
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence. 
Where do they get their food? 
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves. 
It's called varroa destructor. 
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet. 
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation, and I find this remarkable. 
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning, asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me. 
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. 
There must be a reason why." 
And I then went and did a huge amount of training, swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards. 
It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said, "Like handing out water that wasn't wet." 
If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds, surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room. 
I want to show you my watch." 
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. 
What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go? 
It turns out your hospitals are killing people, and they should be at home. 
Being numerous does not make you a slave. 
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos. 
Who sees it all? 
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us, to see how fast that guy's going or stopping. 
Now, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing. 
Basically, it always depends. 
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems. 
I just -- thank you. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) I'm delighted to be here. 
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen. 
He designed a state in "The Republic," a design never implemented. 
So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse. 
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue, and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu? 
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. 
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question. 
This is called a figure-ground illusion. 
seven years ago. 
(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. 
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations, instead of having a thumb, you would either get another opposable thumb, or you would get four fingers. 
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony, and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. 
The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred, or deeply interconnected. 
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?" 
The car is so big, the camera is so small, yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual. 
You can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times, or have different parts of the hardware doing different things. 
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in 2010. 
People put buckets out ... 
Some journeyed to the moons and planets. 
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and, over the next five days, assemble them into biocomposites. 
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. 
(Laughter) And some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells -- and this is in animals and increasingly we're showing this in humans -- that female stem cells, when put even into a male body, do better than male stem cells going into a male body. 
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job. 
I wonder why. 
And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. 
(Music) Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai. 
Other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information. 
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution, I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern. 
It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. 
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug." 
And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. 
So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. 
(Laughter) We have the ability to change our future. 
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home, driving into RISD everyday, driving back. 
Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations, rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time? 
The reason we're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system, but that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter) So at the actual trial, all six of the teenagers testified, and indicated the identifications they had made in the photo array. 
So here's a small visual animation, as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension. 
And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. 
And as you see it come out, in order to actually be able to do anything useful, it can't all stay clustered up like this. 
And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. 
So we have this sound. (Music) And with a bank of live electronics, I can change the sounds radically. (Music) (Music) Like that, and like this. (Music) And so forth. 
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target. 
But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and it's been impacting everyone. 
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen. 
He's got pneumonia, and he looks like he needs intensive care. 
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. 
Just everything is lined, it incorporates -- every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin. 
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. 
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. 
We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. 
So when I go back without the prime, your brain already has the model so you can see it again. 
It was always fun to be with him. 
We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. 
It's a past tense. 
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. 
I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. 
And [the] U.N. says it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. 
This is why you have checks and balances. 
Here you see a patent for an arm in 1912. 
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints, arms tied, arms and legs tied down, arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest. 
Not that there's a lot of competition, right? 
(Laughter) So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races, all religions, all income and education levels. 
As I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group. 
And she said, "Well, he's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house, some rich American with your cameras around your neck, accusing me of enslaving my niece? 
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make, and it was political dynamite, frankly. 
I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. 
Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. 
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing. 
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. 
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions. 
And one of the things you saw at TED about a year and a half ago was this guy. 
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter) That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is. 
And we really, we really loved this machine. 
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita. 
(Laughter) "I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese." 
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent? 
E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public, she loves to take in the arts. 
And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations. 
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?" 
Some of you may recognize this image. 
One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live. 
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes, and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. 
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it. 
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, "I'm an idiot. God wants bread? 
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality. 
So just imagine that for a moment. 
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement. 
They said, we don't want this data retention. 
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real. 
You might be a networking god, building alliances, which you can also do in the game, or just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can. 
He's a scary monster. 
He was an early talker. 
One of the referees who refereed the paper said, "It's too good to be true," which was not very nice. 
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. 
You see a dolphin here, and there's a dolphin, and there's a dolphin. 
I testified to that to the court, and while the judge was very attentive, it had been a very, very long hearing for this petition for a retrial, and as a result, I noticed out of the corner of my eye that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers. 
And for a long time, even after it was documented, it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion. 
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia, or Mongolia, or North Korea, though that's not very popular. 
So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these. 
And then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean? 
So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time. 
(Laughter) They acted silly. 
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product. 
There's also a wireless network in the car, which can be reached from many different ways. 
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, which is what you see Romo doing on the left. 
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. 
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. 
And we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable, the types of questions that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us. 
And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area. 
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs. 
That's between, say at an average use, that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that. 
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story. 
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though, there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. 
Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house. 
(Applause) Audience: Shake. 
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow. 
What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy -- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population, and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience -- the other major experience, the other major input -- which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long -- 
"Should we be there? 
And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory. 
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC, to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. 
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. 
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. 
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities. 
(Laughter) And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here on earth to help others. 
(Applause) "Don't talk to strangers." 
We're healthier, physically and emotionally. 
It has an extraordinary lightness and yet, it is also amazing balanced. 
And all these colored lines here are results; each color is one survey. 
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines? 
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. 
In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. 
An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum, dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture. 
One thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes -- when the car crashes, the front hits into something -- indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. 
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. 
Actually, she had never been to school, not to a lick, one day. 
You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world, some models that you use to understand the world. 
And so that gives me an opportunity, because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great, because it seems like every time I change jobs. 
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him. 
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now." 
At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine, and make him a boy soldier. 
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something, or come up with something, that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference? 
That comes down to under five dollars an hour. 
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting. 
In the next decade? 
She's being filmed with a hidden camera. 
And although that was great for the music business at the time, it wasn't much good for anything else. 
And one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard, I was going up north of Kabul, and all of a sudden, again, I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men. 
This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. 
That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this. 
Man: How do you know? 
Surgeons are not made either. 
Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards, even if another person shuffles. 
Now a couple of companies -- like Google -- they have innovation time off, 20 percent time, where, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization. 
That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago. 
If you really ask yourself this question, you can't help but feel uncomfortable. 
He said, "No, a TED Talk." I said, "But who's Ted? 
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves. 
The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic, quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed. 
Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings, who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. 
So the coordination response asks not, how are these people as employees, but rather, what is their contribution like? Right? 
Actually, it's not, it's actually an important social cue. 
And when you touch it with your finger, you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen, and that actually has a certain amount of value. 
This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena. 
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs. 
As soon as the car left, I went back. 
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th" or whatever. 
That's not true at all. 
Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even. 
And I think that's a mistake. 
Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh, thank you. 
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. 
Well in the face of all these bad headlines, researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. 
There was photographic recall inside the children, I suspect because they're discussing with each other. 
That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen, only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks, if you will, that make up the virtual world. 
Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely. 
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there? 
Not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task. 
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world, throughout the ocean. 
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture, which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed. 
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car. 
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested. 
We don't have disposable resources. 
(Applause) I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. 
The greater the contribution, the more we express and form our individuality, which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with. 
Glamour is a magic spell. 
Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists -- it's a very interdisciplinary field. 
They give you 48 hours to finish this race. 
You know, a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. 
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie. 
We have to get to this. 
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. 
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community." 
And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake, because they must be hiding. 
You may have read that we put watermarks in. 
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars. 
We looked at skyscraper construction, we looked at the aviation world, and we found that they have technology, they have training, and then they have one other thing: They have checklists. 
You re-grow a set of teeth. 
Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. 
It's pretty bleak. 
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. 
Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ... 
But at this time, giving voice to the catadores. 
And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives: that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction. 
The war on talent, the need to attract people at all skill ranges, to push us around in our wheelchairs, but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital. 
I spent three months at the Heart Institute. 
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop. 
After three years of waiting for my sister's return, I decided to go to China to look for her myself. 
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. 
We've got lots of little tidbits in the book. 
So he and mom went to dinner, and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow. 
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed. 
So when the average American consumes 43 times as much as the average African, we've got to think that consumption is an issue. 
They can engage in language -- or to stay out of the language wars, they're involved in intentional and referential communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking. 
They are domestics. 
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop. 
I want to make this world good. 
When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. 
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. 
Now that's compassion. 
(Laughter) Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it, at this point. 
So I like this about interactive video sculpture, that you can actually interact with it, that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves, and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Dogs have interests. 
And he was frowning. 
In fact, Chris was worried and said, "Look, don't show them that slide, because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much. 
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey. 
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation. 
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. 
I call these eight characters radicals. 
Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago, and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex. 
This is an illusion. 
I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years. 
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. 
It's really dirty in production. 
(Laughter) So... 
There are many more examples, but these are just two that you construct what you see. 
It was essentially India being itself. 
You want to generate beliefs about the world. 
Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. 
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art: The first idea is that art should be for art's sake -- a ridiculous idea -- an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world. 
They don't always even know why they're doing it. 
10 years later I gained my sight back. 
As I said, this agent is in us, and, in fact, here's a curious thing, it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds, and where you burn it, and that you do this burning to live. 
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. 
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle. 
But there are other things that people believe that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy, or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution, all that sort of thing, or global warming. 
And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. 
We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe, who, after hearing about HeForShe, created a "husband school." 
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. 
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you. 
(Laughter) We made it into a sailing craft. 
I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed. 
(Laughter) It turns out that what this stuff is -- and Richard Dawkins has written about this -- is, this is really a river out of Eden. 
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements. 
This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school. 
But how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked, or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted? 
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. 
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education. 
It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible; and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time. 
If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment. 
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed. 
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example? 
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. 
"What is worth dying for?" 
You put energy into the right kind of system and out comes wasted heat, entropy and extropy, which is order. 
And to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff. 
So, in place after place we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs, where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of. 
AK: Well, it was a little difficult, because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep. 
For example, they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction. 
So, I changed it so that every season was different, and I continued to do these posters, but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing. 
But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning. 
We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease. 
Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family, thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy. 
The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states, the low-lying island states. 
And we luckily have an opportunity for you. 
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. 
We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. 
It's easier to handle. It's something that we understand really well. 
We then have gone on since to present for [the] international community, for governments, for local governments and for business and for people, for you and me, a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year, which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. 
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. 
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up. 
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs. 
Then the fairness objection goes away. 
Back to this spectrum. 
So, total reversal of trade policy. 
And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. 
They haven't got them. 
We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. 
(Laughter) Within the working drawings! 
Talk about what you heard here. 
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician?" (Laughter) Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you, or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world, when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession, they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake, a monkey and an iguana, and through all of this, I feel, strongly, that something is going wrong. 
And finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think, a really big asteroid heads for Earth. 
The network has two components in them. 
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here, and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like. 
And each time I make public art, I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed. 
If we start one of those community plates spinning, that's really great, that really starts to empower people, but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate, we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater. 
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms. 
And so I'll just go get them. 
In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. 
Now, you say, that's not much use, but it's actually pretty close, considering we can get about 10,000 times more than we started. 
"Yes, yes.""Oh ... " I hand him the money. 
And two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour, which are against poisonous and rotten material. 
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED, but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin, organs and a whole series of other body parts. 
And really do give them a hug. 
We did a design competition, selected a design team. 
If Joe jumped in a coral reef, there are many things the alien could see. 
It became enormous in just a few months. 
I will do exactly as I'm told. 
And the hospital and GE were happy too. 
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from, the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria. 
Most of these deaths are preventable, and that doesn't just make me sad, it makes me angry, and it makes me determined. 
Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct. 
Thank you very much. 
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. 
(Applause) So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. 
How attractive are you? 
We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice. 
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials. We have a general election, but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election. 
But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources. 
(Music) ♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫ ♫ if they come near me, ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫ ♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic, ♫ ♫ that no one withstands, ♫ ♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫ ♫ But if the red light is on ♫ ♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see. ♫ ♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫ 
So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. 
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where. 
If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York -- there are 10 billion of them -- it would take you 317 years. 
And so this one was military technology a few years ago, and now it's open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online. 
The core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. 
And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government, through NIH and National Science -- NSF -- and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. 
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks. 
Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way, and the rains come and the lightning flashes, and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble, and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized, and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks, and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across. 
So thank you very much. 
And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about, the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. 
Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. 
So back to economics. 
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: "We got it all." 
And the answer is no. 
"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel. 
But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. 
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education. 
You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want, or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. 
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times. 
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one? 
Just a photograph. 
What if God is in things? 
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously from my military experience. 
Think about that. 
(Laughter) So school is a game, and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly. 
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia, and gave me a prognosis of "grave." 
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. 
(Laughter) Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few. 
This is one my partner and I worked on. 
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫ ♫ Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫ ♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫ ♫ Nothing more to say ♫ ♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫ ♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫ ♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫ ♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫ ♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫ ♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫ ♫ You don't have to be a big celebrity ♫ ♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫ 
And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift, and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground. 
And that's what I came up with. 
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991. 
The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state. 
Now, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward -- 65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact. 
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test. 
So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for, such as pushing us out of the car, and telling us to find our own way to Granny's, about five miles before we actually got there. 
They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. 
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing. 
Okay? 
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant. 
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply. 
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers. 
They were gone in an instant. 
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. 
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be, but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head, and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head, and they would fish out, swim for crabs. 
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s. 
So me and my friends, we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra-compact and small and highly capable. 
And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly. 
And this is a distributed network. 
I learned something about courage. 
You just look at the political history of the 20th century, and you see things have changed a lot. 
And this is the tower from below. 
So I create these two poles. 
So on the one hand, there was a mocking of authority, but on the other hand, there was a deference towards authority, and these Caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority, which is very striking, very strange in a way, because migrants are very courageous people. 
Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture or something under your desk. 
But from 1991 through the present time, emphasized by the attacks of 2001, the idea of an all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event, act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. 
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate. 
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. 
And something else happened instead. 
And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick, you'll get a T joint. 
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people, who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list, but I was determined to bring them to India, so -- a lot of them were in India. 
And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you, and you see how they could be familiar to you. 
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later, after the first video that I showed to you, is under the control of Aurora's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target. 
I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives. 
It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis, and he's alive, but importantly, he's healthy and he's at work. 
You have formulas that long. 
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer. 
Ah, sorry about that. 
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. 
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference. 
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. 
But that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture. 
There were hypertext comics. 
You suddenly realize that consciousness -- which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature, human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world. 
They broke her bangles. 
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region. 
Yet still, many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. 
So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? 
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed. 
And then in the winter things cool down. 
The city was there. 
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. 
And it was set in a wider watery ooze. 
We've taken this information and we've made a mathematical model out of it. 
There are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest, or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies. 
You'd measure how many -- EL: How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them. 
When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt, which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. 
But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. 
Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. 
Accidents are expensive and costly. 
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area, and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person, but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area, you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars. 
We only have two days of water reserve. 
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. 
And then when they came to a stop, the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air, and then disappear. 
So I could do a lot of projects, and here I am going to share with you only three of them. 
It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang, in this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars, into life, into us. 
But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. 
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience. 
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais. 
It's in that context that I rescue children. 
And this is mainframe healthcare. 
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex." 
We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars. 
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago -- Carlton Coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era -- for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus. 
It's actually a little bit more precise than that. 
So it was very exciting. 
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple, and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine, you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. 
That is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping. 
But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of? 
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it. 
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters. 
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. 
This is the sort of 3D data that a machine will read. 
(Laughter) Thank you very much. 
Continuing with the writings: "The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment, and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before, and he eventually brought me to the emergency room. 
I said, "You're the gift." 
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. 
And even that supposedly honest moment, I would argue, is in service of the lie, but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction. 
My father watched, benevolently, of course, the demonstrations of the month of May, but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve. 
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region. 
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun. 
They were running out of food; I was running out of water. 
So what happens when you put these things together? 
The question is, who will make them? 
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope. 
This map shows the presence of agriculture on planet Earth. 
And that's really what I find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the anointment of video games in the MoMA collection. 
To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle. 
This is not a metaphor. 
But then I realized that, as much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey, they have influenced my journey but they have not been the beginning of it, but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house in upper Sindh of Pakistan, where my father held the hand of my 14-year-old mother and they decided to walk out of the village to go to a town where they could send their kids to school. 
Thank you. 
And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems. 
It had a speech synthesizer. 
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again." 
I cried for a very long time. 
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects. 
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. 
Through cultural changes, our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives. 
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse. 
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago. 
You're also running a civil society. 
that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics. 
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. 
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that," as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd." 
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame? 
And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. 
This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I'll take you through [what] a typical procedure like that looks like, [what] noninvasive surgery looks like. 
And I'm telling you, this is very robust across English texts. 
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide, the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. 
You know that, right? 
I mean, did he? 
It was very time-consuming. 
So it had to be self-righting, and stay up without crashing. 
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. 
I have become myself known. 
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. 
The computer found several texts -- two of them are shown here -- that have very unusual patterns. 
Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. 
We love innovation. 
And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us, and we started. We started to plant, and this first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less, and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again. 
When you're beginning to rot a little bit, all of the videos crammed into your head, all of the extensions that extend your various powers, are going to being to seem a little secondary. 
By looking at these two pictures, I say no, it won't overtake China for a while. 
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner. 
It's a really good combination of those two factors. 
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. 
So what does this mean? 
This is our VP of Engineering. 
So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. 
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month. 
Being up at the top means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement. 
It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where, when we got to a post-conflict situation, there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties. 
And yet, what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better. 
Thank you very much. 
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. 
And in order to understand this, I'm going to take you back a couple of generations. 
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it, we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide. 
Now, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS, this is a graph of the perturbations that were created by the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing, but the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer, and so the same measurement produced this graph. 
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. 
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. 
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida, the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes. 
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. 
When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle. 
But I told him no, I'm sorry, compromise in colors is gray, and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime. 
And in fact, he used the cassowary as an example. 
And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan. 
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area. 
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone, I call up the local village operator. 
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty" -- which was considered bourgeois or tacky. 
But it turns out the men do, because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it, and the men also believe it improves their sex life. 
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21. 
She says, "It was good." 
It's called reconstructed memories. 
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. 
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin, the business school professor at the University of Toronto, calls integrative thinking. 
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right. 
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it. 
That is why I was particularly excited when we launched our "Africa Investigates" series where we investigated a lot of African countries. 
Harvest palms, smoke. 
As you leave here today, I would like to leave you with a very personal message, which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals, and this is really about being open-minded, open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world, creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people, has to be based in being open-minded, because these systems have good things and they have bad things. 
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores, because he knew how much she cared. 
It was dangerous, hard to cross the street. 
So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. 
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. 
It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves, and with threatening noise like this going on, your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body is telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous." 
I'd never done this kind of work before. 
(Applause) My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue. 
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels. 
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. 
Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look. 
Will it do it? 
I will spread the cards and you'll say stop, when I point to them, right. Point, say stop. 
This is a form of resistance. 
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life, trying to see if, in this artificial universe -- he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time. 
(Applause) So now, instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke, you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products, in your office, or back at work in your home. 
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common: transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment, and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science! 
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. 
Here are a few quotes indicating that: "Man has no nature," from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset; "Man has no instincts," from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu; "The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. 
But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut, because I was painting it from my gut. 
They're not even enjoying the show. 
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round. 
He came up to me afterwards, he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story. 
So the era of big infrastructure is over. 
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign. 
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most? 
How do you solve this problem? 
Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health, a fantastic thing. 
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. 
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN, the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments, and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff. 
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his, that we try to resolve the contradiction. 
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them, and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. 
They just want the sharing to go away. 
Now how about exponentially cheaper? 
Physicians and scientists, we accept intellectually that our species, Homo sapiens, is merely one species, no more unique or special than any other. 
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible. 
I'm telling you you didn't shave." 
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. 
Just see the contrast. 
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -- the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on. 
I began documenting the close connection between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. 
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it. 
We can reach back and grab that dust, and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices are part of our health, what we eat is a really important aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food, and if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health. 
Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus. 
If we want different values we have to tell a different story, a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity, that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity, and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group. 
Pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward and you're called a philanthropist. 
They do lots of inconsistent things. 
And actually you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. 
Then we asked them, "How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: I was actually also curious why -- I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates. 
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. 
And actually I become a character in the book. 
This is what it looks like close up -- here's the ant foot, and there's the glue. 
In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness, which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you, so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape, and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement. 
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last. 
We were peer-learning, we were engineering, we were making things, prototyping, but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible, to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from. 
I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. 
That what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse. 
We're talking to something. 
"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies, so I am a movie producer and I really do think, thanks to that video camera I was given in ninth grade. 
First I set up a shop in my own garden, and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest. 
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired. 
How did we get here? 
He can go inside, push inside of the heart, and really feel how the valves are moving. 
This is an extremely new field. 
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. 
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war, that it was against humanity. 
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. 
We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. 
You don't have enough gaming experience. 
Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people, I'm a maths genius. 
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. 
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation. 
But basically, the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world, that I would choose to make, it's that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking. 
In fact, she need not have hurried. 
And they decided to do it. 
I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey American political attitudes: Pew Research, the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, and the most important but the least known is the American National Election Studies group that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes. 
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right? 
I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up. 
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are. 
It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality. 
It reminded me, in an odd kind of way, of my niece's fifth birthday party. 
So far, I've been pretty negative. 
So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. 
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it. 
And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today. 
And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening, a little more respectful of the species. 
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness. 
Help me! Somebody help me!" 
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb, the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago. 
After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference, and after three minutes -- well, if you really studied it, you'd see a difference. 
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. 
So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem, we wanted to build a healthcare network, because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994, and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. 
The big questions facing physics. 
And that's when I told myself, claim your experience. 
Our parents think we're cuckoo. 
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. 
So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money, and this is not sustainable. 
That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value. 
And he finished his talk with the phrase, that, "The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile." 
And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important. 
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know, it's a real project we've heard about. 
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world, and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change. 
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built. 
That sucks. Why not level-up? 
RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us, will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning, wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors? 
And what about capital costs? 
People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. 
And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid. 
Perhaps instead, it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on. 
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. 
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day. 
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile. 
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like the woman in that joke about -- have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother? 
A couple things that are kind of cool. 
I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered. 
All three were diagnosed with lung cancer, the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today. 
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. 
Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?" 
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. 
And they're going to break ground in May. 
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. 
And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web. 
It's a big place. That's all ice. 
But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy, America's electricity use could actually shrink, even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. 
This is where I'm coming from. 
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. 
Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because the d.school, the design school at Stanford, thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment, has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called "From Play to Innovation." 
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983. 
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. 
And because you can't bind the oxygen, maybe you wouldn't consume it, and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. 
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. 
David. 
Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human. 
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right? 
But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college. 
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. 
And what I say to people, it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall, and just we're showing the shadow. 
And they took it to Washington; they showed them; and they're going to be involved now, watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities, like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact, help re-energize their downtown. 
So let's make this a little bit more interesting. 
Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. 
It's a story of nations, of ideologies, of territories, and of conflicts among them. 
Right? 
And I like to show how it looks and how it works. 
(Laughter) "I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer. 
Public and private corruption is a reality. 
Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food. 
He said, "And it's not me, because I like you people." 
And I'd like to finish with one thought, which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean. 
But here, there -- one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor, Judith Butler. 
The world is, in fact, getting more global. 
We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy. 
And the dream was crushed. 
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth. 
Is this something that other people can do? 
Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. 
That is a wonderful thing. 
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control. 
From the moment that our ancestors, perhaps two and a half million years ago or so, began imitating, there was a new copying process. 
For example, the happy wife. 
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome. 
If you want to sell more products, if you want to get more investment, if you want to become more competitive, then you need to start behaving, because that's why people will respect you and do business with you, and therefore, the more you collaborate, the more competitive you become. 
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this. 
(Applause) So in 2011, power shifted, from the few to the many, from oval offices to central squares, from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks. 
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened. 
Thank you. 
But we'll certainly learn a lot. 
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. 
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day, the 21st of September? 
Why? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel. 
Another group got an environmental message. 
So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads, and people don't like to eat, quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily, but when we think of something as a health food, we think of it as something we eat out of obligation, not out of passion and love for the flavor. 
What they want are implements to increase their production: something to fertilize the soil, something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market. 
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better," which, wow. 
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years, 24 months. 
This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics, biology, computer science, the social sciences, but what about economics? 
And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed. 
It gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up, and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection, about zero degrees, and then you end up getting colder and colder, and that's the top of the stratosphere. 
(Laughter) CA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense, because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal, correct? 
We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. 
I don't know the stories. 
Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making. 
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals. 
I didn't see Abed coming. 
So how do we solve? 
Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog, or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect, or four legs as one of a trotting crab. 
It's a book on culture, and, as you can see, culture is rapidly drifting around. 
We are sharing with them whatever we have. 
Now, science indicates that, yes, we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space, if we move simultaneously, collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale, in transformative options, which build resilience on a finite planet. 
Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products. 
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold. 
In those times documents had hard covers, they were filled in by hand, and they stated your job. 
Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week. 
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. 
You can today download a product with software like this, view the product in 3D. 
What I have here are two empty water bottles. 
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small. 
So what the governor got was an empty shell. 
That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information. 
(Laughter and cheers) So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out. 
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. 
And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral, memetic infection. 
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind. 
Durga, the fearless one. 
I'm not home, can't make family dinner? 
There's a camera. 
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done. 
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too. 
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this; we're very excited about the future possibilities for that. 
(Laughter) I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again and I started walking. 
And two weeks after this drawing was done, we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment, on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me. 
I am a photo-based artist from Russia. 
This fish actually has high beams. 
This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. 
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins, is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. 
Now we, as humans, we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. 
And so this is a pretty weird model, right? 
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. 
I went out and I worked at a non-profit, I went to grad school, I phone-banked, I protested, I volunteered, and none of it seemed to matter. 
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three. 
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that." 
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie. 
This is a "before and after." So that was before. 
Came in. Got this concentrated attention. 
But as a result, they are themselves confronted with this same freedom that others have to value or disvalue them. 
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air. Either way, these are tremendous explosions, 20 megatons. 
JA: So this is the Kroll Report. 
Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy. 
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions. 
It really is just a new idea. 
The reality, with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad. 
Can we measure it better than we do? 
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them. 
And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. 
This man was in an NGO feeding center, being helped as much as he could be helped. 
The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh, we don't think you can do that." 
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right, and a chimpanzee on your left. 
If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. 
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. 
(Applause) When my father and I started a company to 3D print human tissues and organs, some people initially thought we were a little crazy. 
But just if you take malaria out, deaths from everything else go down. 
Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety. 
And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?" 
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product? 
But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better, to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. 
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor except this woman. 
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious. 
And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books." 
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar. 
That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s. 
It means taking down the fences, it means blocking the drainage ditches, it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea, but otherwise stepping back. 
And if it were not for these places that show hope, I don't think I could continue doing this job. 
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks." 
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela. 
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available, but, going back to what Michael Specter said, the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. 
The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. 
Unable to make their own toxins, these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals. 
Which is to create conditions conducive to life. 
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black-tie affair. 
When he finished the story, I said to him, "Dick, I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich." 
In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby, and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child. 
(Laughter) I found him on the Internet when I was looking up a reference. 
So I'm going to play you a couple of those. 
Come over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. 
If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. 
We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. 
It basically means to be human and to do the right thing. 
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow." 
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one. 
Sketching an interface. 
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species. 
We've all heard these things. 
And I just look at this, and I think, yes, we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets, by using elements of uncertainty, by using these multiple targets, by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system, by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets to collaborate and compete, to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. 
Of course, earthquakes and all the natural phenomena -- floods, tornadoes, etc. -- take their toll. 
From everything from a weird hotel lobby, to Saran wrap placed over your window, to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black, and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun. 
But love isn't always a happy experience. 
Isn't she fabulous? 
And so I try to do this in my books. 
What is one of these organizations to pick? 
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. 
So, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you. 
Or we could use it as research plots, where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils, or we could use it to generate energy. 
So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem, thinking about exhibitions there, thinking about what it means to discover art's possibility. 
Those perceptions of reality go extinct. 
What we rely on is not an incomplete system. 
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?" 
And so with all these crises, we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation. 
There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today. 
So what to do next? 
Way more interesting than Monterey even today. 
Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful. 
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover." 
When you get to the very bottom of the slide -- (Laughter) -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube. 
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. 
INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology. 
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet. 
(Applause) So in order for all this to work, obviously I have got to be in a position of trust. 
He needed to be a very sympathetic character. 
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities. 
And so your brain is fooled. 
You know, no power required. 
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of Hollywood and science. 
You could do the whole thing with addition. 
You're going to make the music and the rhythm. 
I could access newspapers at any time and every day. 
We are anxious that we are not good enough. 
and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars, what can I do to benefit other people?" 
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists, but by how rarely we needed them. 
If your name was Harry Baker, then our names would be the same. 
So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go, and that's a very, very important thing, because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile, you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else, and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line. 
What you would have is that, when we would go to parties, you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper. 
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece. 
So with that, let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. 
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto, Ajax makes a lunge for it. 
(Laughter) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women, know how much these potential men has, and how much these women can do the same job they are doing. 
E: I'm special. 
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin, and you smooth it out, so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is. 
And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. 
And if these algorithms, like the algorithms on Wall Street, just crashed one day and went awry, how would we know? 
What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction? 
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. 
I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say, "Well, the right way to start would be, let's make a great seat belt for adults. 
They don't employ those workers. 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. 
How many people gave of their time and their expertise, and their patience, to deal with me? 
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are. 
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. 
People really like to have sex. 
And that's what the lawn was. 
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like, and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity, and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself. 
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey. 
People would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment. 
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night, and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us. 
In another study, we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign, and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign, many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection, not a stop sign. 
So I looked in the book for the most difficult move, and it was this. 
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave. 
And then when they failed, they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. 
Second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons, and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention, it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare, the problem with that is that it's seen that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used, not as an alternative to lethal force, but as a lethal force multiplier -- that you use non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective. 
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. 
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. 
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. 
Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta, reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24-hour competition. 
And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. 
(Music) Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986. 
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. 
And the answer is no. 
The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else, they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them. 
What's happening in the area of health? 
This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. 
There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among. 
Unfortunately, when this was implemented, the developer was slightly inebriated and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned. 
We live in a time where there are all kinds of really, really smart people running around, saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. 
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. 
And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. 
These are actually cells that we obtained. 
Thank you. 
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. 
(Applause) Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home. 
But it turned out that I was misled. In fact, seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them was positive and that was published, but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished. 
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution." 
Well, biologists who couldn't take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say, "Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground. 
I'm not a fan." 
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals. 
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. 
And life starts to expand and expand and expand, until it goes kaput. 
It is endless. 
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy? 
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships. 
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises, and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs, and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them. 
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll, on H Street in Washington. 
And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination, you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism. 
They first dropped some dummies. 
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999. 
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. 
They work together in climate change, for example. 
This is the gay lifestyle. 
Either they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one, or this one's bigger than that one. 
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less. 
I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy, and, like at least 20 other people in a room of this size, I was a stutterer. 
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue, today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting. 
So you can imagine the scale of the effort. 
How many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical TED event next week? 
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity. 
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller, who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer. 
I joined Ford after college, after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. 
Stay here. I've got a question. 
We were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this: the Historic Scotland, and the Glasgow School of Art. 
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. 
At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession. 
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. 
Boy comes home from school, and he says, "I hate writing." 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, can we see that? 
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy. 
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. 
You can make the baby poop. 
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. 
It's about two-thirds built out right now. 
And what I'm just going to do is -- I'm going to hide that. 
It's four words; we call that a four-gram. 
And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity -- well, it was a singularity back then. 
And this was a big deal. 
And you can see here there are three columns. 
And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine. 
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics. 
And remember, the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth, so if an election official wants to find out how you voted, they will not be able to. 
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further, and actually produce placebo education. 
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them. 
And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said, "Neil, there's only one question that really matters. 
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. 
Those of you who have been to India have seen that. 
And then there was another influence. 
Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope? 
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English. 
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down, lifted me high into the air, and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars. 
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't. 
So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people. 
Now, Frank didn't hear anything. 
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top? 
The consumer is demanding it. 
And here they are: these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise. 
So here's what we do. Basically, we developed numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining a particular concept in math. 
And a lot of it is because women are not able, are not free, to show their face to their self. 
The police -- and knowing because I've actually helped to train police -- police, in particular Western jurisdictions at least, are trained to de-escalate force, to try and avoid using force wherever possible, and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort. 
And very, very difficult times. 
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap. 
And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation, hearing it, has been very, very energizing to me. 
This is a typical result that many people have presented, and there are many variations on it. 
We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. 
So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech. 
It allows us to make sense of the world around us. 
And it would clean your clothes. 
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. 
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes? 
I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing. 
Here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs, or urban agriculture. 
Iran is doing that right now. 
We have no suspects." 
It's always about my taste. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds, if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half. 
So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers. 
One of the features, though, of disgust, is not just its universality and its strength, but the way that it works through association. 
So by this way, the kid, to take care of himself, is to take care of this living object. 
(Applause) So, what excites me about cymatics? 
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. 
And so the state can come in. 
The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be. 
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece, and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery. 
It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. 
In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas. 
So then it became quite easy. 
When you have trees, the root system holds the water. 
On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold. 
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying. 
In the old days, if you were rich, you literally had people working for you. 
But we wanted to make the economic case, because if we could make the economic case, then the value of doing this would be completely compelling. 
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. 
If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures -- which is the current system -- they would do more. 
What we should expect then is the opposite effect. 
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. 
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits. 
NM: It worked. DL: It worked. 
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1. 
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal, but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't: this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. 
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton, and I could never do it." 
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging. 
No pavement. 
(Applause) So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? 
Most of the planet is ocean water. 
Durga, the epitome of creative feminine energy, or shakti. 
You picked a particular breed, you learned some new information about the breed. 
There's no need to play the market. 
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same. 
(Laughter) So, this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK? 
And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved. 
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices, we can put on a simple patch. 
They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes. 
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice. 
So the implications of that are vast, because it means that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world, because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did. 
Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though. 
And I was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness. 
Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me. 
I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself, and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. 
We make our kids feel like they matter to us. 
The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. 
So I'm going to bake bread for you. 
Save More Tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year -- sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas, volunteering more in the community, exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet. 
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side. 
So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat, in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. 
It actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. 
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building. 
The hind legs have got the same action. 
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion, to come up with new things, because you're coming from a different perspective. 
Let's have the next slide. 
Language seems to be really important here. 
And the answer, by all accounts, was no. 
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down. 
And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative -- and this is all played anonymously. 
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"? 
The gunner was throwing candy. 
The American will say, "I am because I am, and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime." 
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered. 
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them, one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us. 
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru, and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas. 
Now the average age of our fellows is 28, so I am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them. 
(Audio: Laughing) (Laughter) I'm the best. 
Audience: Soap. 
They were always best in class. 
So, I thought, could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier, and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan? 
We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs, we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion -- sometimes a battle royale -- to figure out what are the key impacts of these products, what is a global benchmark, what's an acceptable impact, and design standards around that. 
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. 
And that amazes me. 
And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem, in the development of remedies, in the implementation of reforms, and then later, in the monitoring of reforms. 
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. 
Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi? 
Most important thing is: Only you can change yourself, and only you can change the world and make it better, for people as well as penguins. 
The serif is not really in place. 
You may not agree with the ideas, but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. 
And he said to me, "Oh no. 
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. 
And it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me. 
Becoming the basis of the economy. 
So, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, "This is going to be a whole new world," this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. 
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts. 
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. 
And, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased, clean search result is, and is likely to remain, a myth. 
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy, or McMafia, for short. 
Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. 
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general -- all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to. 
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. 
There is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues, and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues. 
The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young. 
It looks like a beautiful photograph. 
And while there's no substitute for speed, maneuverability is a very close second. 
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra. 
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind. 
(Applause) The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden. 
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s and holding my own, back when that was a fad. 
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings, and what the program is for those cells to differentiate, one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer, and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas. 
(Laughter) So what we see -- (Laughter) what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands, and here in South Kensington, that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else, you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function, and one in which they are more human with each other. 
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others. 
And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. 
This is the Hejaz Railway. 
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that. 
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman. 
And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter) For some reason, the car drivers are -- they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do. 
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable. 
They are self-aware, they are predictive, reactive and social. 
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months and it basically killed 60 percent of the coral. 
And if you look at a guy called Dennis, when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher? -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist. 
But inevitably, these tumors progress towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here. 
It was the beginning of a change. 
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs, and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation, it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor. 
And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it. 
These are all the first cloned animals of their type. 
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine." 
And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today, but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent, Celtic magic. 
They wanted us to make use of the space. 
So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet -- you, me, everybody -- would be really good at making these trade-offs. 
Is it teenage years? Is it middle age? 
It's not true. 
My great-grandparents died, all of them, by the time they were 60. 
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. 
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic. 
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter. 
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much. 
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. 
That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence. 
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me. 
Well, I'll tell you -- a lot. 
And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. 
So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at. 
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown. 
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine? 
No infrastructure, no problem. 
Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight. 
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale. 
China exports business people, nannies, students, teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. 
If it cannot take us there, it is not good literature. 
I had art. 
And see what his response is. 
Certain subjects came up over and over: how much money they made, what kind of husband they hoped to marry, whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were. 
So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you, I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women. 
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. 
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us, to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. 
Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this. 
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. 
I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it? 
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010. 
This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah, that is literally 80,000 years old. 
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. 
(Laughter) That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots. 
Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done, we've done it with paint and temporary materials. 
We go from this view out to the stars. 
And Nanny's great insight, really, was to think, here's a child who can't see. 
So a lot of your vision -- the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in. 
That is in less than 60 years. 
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. 
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know, mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass. 
We weren't even here. 
They created a global computer made up of people. 
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. 
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai, there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people. 
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing. 
And you see the lamp here, I know. 
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction. 
This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin. 
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us. 
Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab, you'll see a white, floury pulp, which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein, more protein than in human milk. 
Credit card, investment account? 
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. 
Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. 
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. 
And my brother and I started to pick it, and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!" 
Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm, you do need a psychology of justice. 
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers, and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony. 
Find out what they are. 
And at the end of each ride, we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference, and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. 
This is a picture of it. 
The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. 
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original. 
And I'm like, "I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it." 
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty. 
So in the second version of it, there are 100 billion or 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies, or whatever they have in the future. 
Remember, it's a question about JavaScript. 
They reproduce. That's population biology 101. 
When you have a little museum, you have little dinosaurs. 
Okay. Anyway. 
They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes, made a little switch, you see here, wired it up, tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. 
HP: (In Chinese) YR: I was born and raised near Manchester, in England, but I'm not going to say it in English to you, because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent. 
Now the good news here is that if you take surveys from around the world, we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy. 
For example, in polite requests, if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome," we know exactly what he means, even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed. 
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. 
For a while I was an interface designer. 
Firstly I'm going to show you the transparency. 
We're doing two different things here. 
The amount of resources we put in are disparate. 
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel. 
You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises, this thing, "Click, clack click click click," steam engine, "Ding," right? (Laughter) You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer. 
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on, might serve even better. 
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God, but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. 
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover, in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down. 
Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is. 
That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted for lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on, the greater good. 
(Applause) Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. 
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon, northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe. 
But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe -- the building blocks of reality. 
Although they make no claim to architectural beauty, they are, in their perfect temporariness, a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place. 
(Laughter) It's an arduous, difficult sport, and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport. 
But I think, as integration of exponential technologies, this is the example. 
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth, transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts, and we're still in contact with it. 
The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work, two researchers who were at Harvard, and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology, which are remarkably beautiful studies, but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. 
(Spanish) (Laughter) So what happened in Colombia? 
So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. 
We're all effectively part of an extended African family. 
Penguins are real athletes: They can swim 173 kilometers in a day. 
That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is, the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again, and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved." 
It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do, like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions. 
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. 
Now, what good are springy legs then? What can they do? 
Ah, avaricious heaven! 
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there, that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career. 
He was wrong. Some people were paying attention, but for the wrong reasons. 
I've been interested in food for a long time. 
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. 
Three. You need three lessons, and they need to be terribly profound. 
As you age, you're much more likely to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, all sorts of diseases. 
The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent, because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time. 
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is. 
And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. 
(Applause) We call this satellite "Dove," and we call it "Dove" because satellites are typically named after birds, but normally birds of prey: like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, Kill, I don't know, Kestrel, these sort of things. 
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R&amp;D. 
And I forgot to bring one up with me. 
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause) I'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures. 
So there's more new venues. 
We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today, with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes. 
(Laughter) I kid you not. That's exactly what it said. 
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962. 
We adore babies because they’re so cute. 
Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair. 
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. 
Now, I think, in fact, we're at a turning point in human history, where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles. 
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. 
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes, and they're all wondering at some point or another, "Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?" 
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue. 
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, "I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me." 
(Applause) So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. 
And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. 
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection with somebody else -- and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous, contradictory, phosphorescent signals. 
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world. 
And one was punishment. 
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer. 
The new chromosome went into the cell. 
You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid. 
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells, and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing. 
So automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that. 
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization. 
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed. 
You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars. 
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun." 
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection. 
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and '70s, and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. 
What has changed our society has been wireless devices. 
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. 
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment: burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel, being pulled apart by horses and so on. 
A secret language, a seven-second handshake, a way of knowing that you're in or out. 
We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do. 
But I have some good news for you, because I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way. 
And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. 
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you. 
We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up, and what they really lacked was social trust. 
After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children, where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. 
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. 
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour, he finally said, "So, Miss Yang, do you have any questions to ask me?" 
(Music) Thank you. Thank you. 
It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear. 
(Applause) I love trees, and I'm very lucky, because we live near a wonderful arboretum, and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife and now, with my four-year-old, and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek. 
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap in the Village, that my neighbor was her. 
Astrolabes have an incredible history. 
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves, out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit? 
So I turned him over. 
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior. 
We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments. 
That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why. 
Imagine I want to intercept this ball. 
Open your eyes. Look at that. 
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intense this brain system is. 
Audience: The cart's not part of the game. 
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long. 
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things, or are we talking a more endemic situation, that many people are actually capable of behaving this way? 
So Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.

What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. 
It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. 
And of course, I was only interested in the math, so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going, "You know, I didn't learn it this way." 
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.

That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. 
And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did. 
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent, and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing. 
This is the first time I went after two and a half hours. 
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing, passion in life, and focusing all your energy on it, and I've never been able to do that. 
We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. 
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real? 
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. 
Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool, which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars, you can type a question in, and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that, and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. 
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. 
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking, I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract. 
But I'd like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam, when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient, we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage, but we're losing much more than that. 
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. 
That's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 American households. 
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money. 
But the materiality matters too, because in every society that anthropologists have looked at, material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods, a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories, for example, about how important we are. 
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script, and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. 
But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess. 
Trying to replace pancreas, trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. 
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce. 
X equals Y. 
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO, she started her career as university professor, teaching English literature. 
But it's everybody's idea now. 
We all have synesthetic abilities. 
And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men, priests, traditions and rulers. 
Each time I click it, car turn. 
And for that reason, we ought to be saving it. 
Now, I'm an aging hippie. 
The plant also gets smaller. 
It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. 
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one. 
This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York. 
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!) Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new. 
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids. 
He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her, And it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked, So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits. 
I will tell you by the end of my speech. 
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives. 
She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen. 
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. 
And as you're thinking about this, we're continuing to mutate.

You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around -- everything is being run by computers. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
But to five-year-old me, I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way for me to pee. 
Called me by a name I did not recognize, said "lesbian," but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie. 
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides. 
This will take two years. 
Sure enough after two months of moping around, 61 days later, 61 was who he found, He had lost his keys and his parents were out. 
And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. 
And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour, working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. 
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths. 
It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search for four in the morning. 
And like Hitler, Goering fancied himself a collector of art. 
BJ: About 40 people. 
Thank you for making your site. 
Here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure, with a cloud and with very bright light. 
Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets? 
Think about how we select our judges in this country. 
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment, and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. 
You think, well it's been up, it's been down, its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down. 
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable. 
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters. 
And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored the BBC, al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations. 
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand. 
What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. 
So, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper. 
So it's an interesting paradox at play there. 
The latest date I put was, I said, I am going to expire my fear of my leftist, feminist mother-in-law, and this today is the date! (Laughs) She's watching. (Laughter) Anyway, you know, I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself, and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. 
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke -- now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ... 
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. 
This, I think, is a huge change. 
And ultimately, the challenge of the baker, the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef, is to deliver flavor. 
One more. Get those brains working. Come on. 
Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem, that was what I did, form a nonprofit. 
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc. 
They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array, and the day after the shooting, they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said, "That's the picture. 
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. 
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth. 
Portray them sympathetically, and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses. 
And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering, and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing -- replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ. 
And so they helped the just one. 
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, "Save the endangered hillbillies." 
Panbanisha watched. 
But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die. 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking.

And I noticed that she was clowning around. 
It's going to take longer for some things. 
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn. 
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm. 
And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. 
Now, let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food. 
Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here. 
Or perhaps, Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man. 
(Laughter) So, Dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius, rocket scientist, inventor. 
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there, I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me, "You've got to get everybody involved here. 
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film. 
I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. 
Chris. 
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered. 
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. 
It's jumped 20 years into 20-over game. 
Now this has been a huge problem for many years, basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses, bacteria and fungal diseases with it. 
And coming home, my cofounder and I, we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems. 
Well in 25 years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature. 
None of us ever get through this life without heartache, without turmoil, and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality, you find your way, and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders, and she said, "Let's find our way to Florida." 
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me, and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist." 
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet, and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. 
This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996, a very emotional year for me. 
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it. 
Now, a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion. 
She lays eggs, she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva. 
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing. 
They were using it on their body. 
When you're no longer locked in yourself, and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out, and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing, and realizing that you are the other being, somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can, you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine, like the Beatles used to sing. 
(Laughter) And if you did that angiogram, which is the red, you can see the man's disease. 
So this -- we're going to zoom in. 
Two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene. 
We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer. 
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk. 
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. 
(Laughter) And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines. 
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself. 
I thought, "I could be Khaled." 
The World Wide Web? Not so sure. 
So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens. 
I was free, I was happy. 
We encouraged him to improvise. 
Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum. 
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her, and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. 
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond. 
It's going to be simple to accomplish this. 
This one is "English Country Garden." 
We'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved, and that was the hills, because I loved the hills. 
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads, and then they send these people home once the roads are built. 
We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. 
And we just count on down to the bottom. 
Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun, Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration: the radio astronomy age. 
And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial -- and it's a great speech: "Best of all," he says, "is to win. 
(Laughter) Because we had different models based on our different experiences. 
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. 
OK, we got him. Now we get a meal. 
But this is very shaky. 
PM: So how large is the collection? 
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same. 
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020. 
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass that grows in the field. 
Isn't it extraordinary? 
It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. 
In a pre-Internet world, sovereignty over our physical freedoms, or lack thereof, was controlled almost entirely by nation-states. 
And beyond the walls of our lab, we're even beginning to see signs of change in society. 
Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving. 
When did that last happen? 
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound. 
We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. 
And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead, to inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team. 
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City." 
So, for instance, in all of Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. 
But she will be successful. 
And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. 
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around; we are part of a big ecosystem. 
Thank you so much, my fellow citizens. 
And what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things. 
When they're involved in foreplay, they're thinking about something very, very important -- and that's having their genetic material remain, 10,000 generations from now. 
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA, and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body, I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. 
There's no public park in Mogadishu. 
But I'd remind you what I'm talking about, I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons. 
I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. 
And by the time a diagnosis was made, she was in a deep spiral. 
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. 
I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide. 
So Hannah's approach, on the other hand, is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves. 
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. 
But I would argue that flies do more. 
All that from this little formula, which has whatever, five symbols in it. 
(Laughter) I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. 
Eventually, the new model will replace the old model. 
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents. 
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding. 
We have six species yet in Madagascar, and we don't know what is the potential of this plant, but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be threatened with extinction. 
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies. 
I was gasping for air. 
Now the question then is: how gloomy is this? 
I did not clip her wings, and that's all. 
Does anyone know what this is? 
If anything goes wrong, I want to be ready. 
But nevertheless, there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart, in terms of the love that I feel for these people. 
And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city, they suck up all the water. 
But the way the symmetries interact enable us -- we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. 
So as a naive New Zealander I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon. 
Relatively sparse number of producers. 
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. 
If my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you, I would rather you forget me. 
That's what we're watching TV for. 
In fact, here's some footage from about 1984. 
The math serves the conversation, the conversation doesn't serve the math. 
And I don't think -- (Laughter) -- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. 
So in the following week, I was back in the streets, but that time, I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore. 
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market. 
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt. 
We go to the dam that we talked about, we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river, crossing off the bridges that don't match. 
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success. 
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy. 
The diver here has a rope toy, and I'm on the keyboard on the left, and I've just played the rope key, and that's the request for the toy from the human. 
The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. 
And so they still weren't getting it. 
You need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization, because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust, and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world. 
(Laughter) Fibonacci! Of course. 
At that moment, we talk about momentum. 
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight? 
This has been known for half a century. 
At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. 
And just to give you a sense of how this works, imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. 
No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history. 
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks. 
And with this tool, we can predict three things. 
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information? 
Looked for something different for the second one. 
This lasts six months with no power; absolutely zero power, because it loses less than a half a watt. 
He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. 
This Arduino project, which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime any of these over-exposed personalities is mentioned. (Laughter) I'll show you how I made it. (Applause) MB: Check this out. 
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons. 
So the problem is, those two nuclei, they are both positively charged, so they don't want to fuse. 
Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster? 
And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. 
That's important and it's an important shift. 
Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good? 
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars. 
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well. 
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow, I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own. 
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. 
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design. 
And if you’re starting a design firm, let’s say, then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security. 
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, "takes me out of my everyday realm" and "makes me feel better." 
And here's the worst news of all. 
He never used my nickname again. 
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. 
So I have branded myself as a war child. 
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures. 
And this is why I use the analogy to coral. 
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts. 
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better. 
They thought it was real. 
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over. 
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. 
In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. 
(Laughter) Justice. Truth. Communism. 
In India it was just impossible to paste. 
The bride. 
They don't know that she's dead. 
Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals. 
If they did, how would we tell them what to do? 
Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25. 
That whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system. 
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread. 
Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea was his wife's cellphone beeping. 
And imagine what might happen, because every region has something to offer. 
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. 
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there. 
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter. 
So could art change the world? 
Before the crisis, this would have been utterly unthinkable, yet it was accepted remarkably quickly. 
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. 
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings, unpack the meaning of the clue. 
And you can see, he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. 
And the journalist was asking him, "Why is this so important?" 
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues. 
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family. 
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say, extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast. 
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah? 
What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems? 
Sometimes I used to walk more at night. 
In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious -- although I must say, our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday, April 15th. 
In a short story called "Oh Yes," she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl, and she looks at her child with a sense of pride, but she also wonders, what price will she pay? 
But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure. 
The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket. 
Now there are many ways you can get infected. 
This can be done with the future spectrographs. 
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for? 
But also back then, remember we stopped eating French fries in this country. 
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage. 
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this, but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow. 
We can't really be both of those. 
Foremost, I have come to think that romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive. 
So, all of these things -- greater metabolic demands, reduced reproductive success, changes in respiration and metabolism. 
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar." 
The parachutes are there -- hopefully, more for psychological than real reasons, but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that. 
But even so, as you go out into those future years, various pension costs, health costs go up enough, and the revenue does not go up enough. 
The product was that airplane. 
(Clapping) (Clapping) Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three? 
(Applause) Imagine, if you will -- a gift. 
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55. 
A lot of you said, "Ten." 
And they were holding it in their laps. 
We might not even know what this protein is, but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. 
But here it is. It's fluorescent. 
The who and the why are what's important to me. 
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. 
It starts with the global hubs. 
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. 
They do talk to their kids. 
The signature weapon of the war is the IED, and the signature wound is severe leg damage. 
Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. 
They, in fact, berate it. 
(Laughter) But nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950. 
(Laughter) So we shift gears for a minute, and say, "I know: television; advertising. Push push. 
Etc. etc. 
(Applause) (Music) I'd like to thank everybody, all the scientists, the philosophers, the architects, the inventors, the biologists, the botanists, the artists ... 
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind. 
I knew those two were related. 
If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease, we can take it enormously the other direction, and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward. 
And before that Leonardo, I understood that this object could become part of a journey for me every day, sitting in my office. 
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code. 
He was worried about right and wrong. 
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason, usually. 
The forth pressure is surprise, the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm, that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably, controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems, and that in fact, surprise is universal, as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly and often irreversibly. 
I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. 
Scientists and engineers change the world. 
Well, I think there are about three reasons: technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what I call "everyday living" -- to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago: figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things -- and thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking. 
First was Autonomy. 
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. 
A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief. 
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know, next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization's story so far.

I wanted to test the limits of the system. 
The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me. 
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry. 
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge, is not new to my neck of the desert. 
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. 
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes. 
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for. 
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment where my father, who never takes off from work, he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person, going to school to see his son, how he's doing, and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know, John is good at math and art." 
What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. 
And it's transformed from being an ugly, unsafe, undesirable address, to becoming a beautiful, attractive, dignified sort of good address. 
It's hard work every single day. 
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing. 
The history of foie gras. 
Thank you. 
PM: If you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk, what would you say that is a result of this experience, for you personally, and what you've learned about women, and men, as you've made this journey? 
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training, give people more specialization or bring in more technology. 
Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent. 
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times, and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. 
GG: I want to make the world a better place. 
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil. 
And what that means is there's hope. 
The same is true of the train. 
What do you do for a living?" 
There are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently. 
OK. This is a bit of a problem. 
Sometimes you have to. 
What is the evidence upon which this is based? 
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
It is a success story. It has been a success story. 
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal. 
TD: So, every one of you who has come here is so talented, and you have so much to offer to the world, I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference, the momentum, the positivity, and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world. 
And I was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together. 
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful. 
I'm pleased to announce that, along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF, we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life. 
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this. 
And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin, in her high heels and her miniskirt. 
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. 
Boy: Spiny. 
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years have been charting death. It's strange -- extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon. 
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. 
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. 
JH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here. 
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out, "The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!" 
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. 
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story, I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome, and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. 
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life. 
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life, there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there, altogether 10^22 stars. 
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. 
Now see if you can put it back together. 
INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency, it would be a truly international one, in which, in particular, the emerging economies would have an equal interest, voice and representation. 
EG: Thank you, everybody! 
There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. 
The older face is miserable. 
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast. 
We recognize this is a finite resource, and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. 
Now, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015. 
I had never lived alone for any period of time, and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night. 
Birds then came, bringing in seeds, and our pile became an oasis of life. 
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. 
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw, and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins. 
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. 
Two months later, six years old, I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products. 
So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. 
Since I was a boy, in my early childhood, I always wanted to be a musician, and, thank God, I made it. 
How can we explain this universality? 
But you know the object is just a pivot. 
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn. 
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC with eight million trucks. 
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. 
If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? 
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction. 
Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. 
You have Twitter, we have Weibo. 
Emily Dickinson once wrote, "Parting is all we need to know of hell." 
Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots. 
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves. 
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking. 
You become utterly incapacitated. 
OK, my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. 
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch. 
If we did, it would be a complete mess, because there's a lot of stuff out there. 
So what do you think happens to these gals? 
And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. 
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m." 
They have plenty of males to choose from, and these females turn out to be very picky. 
The closer I got to my finish line, that rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island, the more I started to realize that the biggest lesson that this very long, very hard walk might be teaching me is that happiness is not a finish line, that for us humans, the perfection that so many of us seem to dream of might not ever be truly attainable, and that if we can't feel content here, today, now, on our journeys amidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit, the open loops, the half-finished to-do lists, the could-do-better-next-times, then we might never feel it. 
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia, and put it into a blob of linked data on the web, which he called dbpedia. 
Because our dental anatomy is actually made, not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. 
Put your tongue away, Barry. 
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense. 
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago, as you can see. June 25th, monster calving events happened. 
So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading, and share with you a glimpse from my current project, which is different from the previous one, but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-learning, learning by doing, self-exploration and community-building, and this project deals with K-12 math education, beginning with early age math, and we do it on tablets because we believe that math, like anything else, should be taught hands on. 
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. 
You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open. 
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever. 
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government. 
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Thank you so much. 
(Laughter) I think Paul Simon is in the audience, and he has -- he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex, "Slip-Slidin' Away." 
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s. 
I'd also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries. 
Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity, you see countries all the way. 
(Music) The gay agenda, people! 
Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared. 
I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. 
And I was mentioning Abed and myself, noting deliberately that I was here in peace, to the people in this town, when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon. 
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. 
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then. 
There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood, and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. 
It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators. 
And from literate populations, new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge, religion and politics. 
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state. 
He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years. 
Why do we call it that? 
Everything had been taken from us, and the hostility was intense. 
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures? 
Again, fairly more complex organs, but by far, the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized, a lot of blood vessel supply, organs such as the heart, the liver, the kidneys. 
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough. 
We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. 
That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws come out, so for example, on the environment, there's the Aarhus Convention, which is a European directive that gives people a very strong right to know, so if your water company is dumping water into your river, sewage water into your river, you have a right to know about it. 
What kind of innovation would get done? 
And I say to Tony, "Let's do this." 
African narratives in the West, they proliferate. 
You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying -- you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it. 
And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us. 
Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly, without breaking election secrecy, which is so very important. 
I didn't know that; that's pretty cool. 
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this, making a list of the different things that we had to do, and so we developed a new technology, It's software and hardware, that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves. 
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. 
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi, 75 years ago, when he spoke about bread. 
And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you’re going to live longer, you’re going to feel better, you’re going to lose weight, and so on. 
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world, somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. 
So there's something super interesting about natural systems. 
Remember where we are, 1.25 watts per square meter, wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five. 
The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast. 
With cooperation, we can do more with less. 
It's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible. 
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. 
That's the thing. 
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen, and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. 
In my team, the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. 
Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results, in all cases. 
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black. 
Another is that there are bold, new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. 
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. 
How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah? 
(Laughter) And Rick is as a pagan god, which I thought was kind of appropriate, in a certain way. 
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks. 
Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it. 
People who have access to these drugs stop dying. 
There's a model of ARES here. 
Intuitive is just another word for familiar. 
The good stars, Pale helms and spiky spurs, Run away. 
Unlike fins and blues, which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans, the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds, so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency, broader-band and more complicated. 
But there's also a wonderful case for optimism. 
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. 
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. 
What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie "Her," Samantha? 
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could be a great communicator. 
First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. 
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful? 
And then from 11 to 1, they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China. 
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface, and then it is attacked, because they don't want the evidence, in my opinion. 
And, I love this story so much. 
And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that? 
They're very well taken care of. 
E: Meow. 
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. 
They said, "The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist. 
And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep, or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain, but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. 
Actually, for the first 20 years, the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow. 
They don't count in law. 
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months. 
These guys are New World primates, which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago. 
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation. 
Now then. 
And what I've discovered since is this: Bullies use violence in three ways. 
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family, and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law, her intestine suddenly strangled one day, and we took her to the emergency room, and she was, she was in really bad shape. 
But here you can look at the list. 
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. 
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization. 
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait. 
It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights. 
They have resources, and if we can add the will, the commitment, they know how to deliver that product. 
How have I insulted my host?" 
SW: And the rooster? 
(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen. 
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. 
And so when those tools started to fail, and public opinion started to turn against those tools, they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do. 
Let's think about Mexican streets: they're unsafe because of violence, so people stay at home. 
We basically have a chat room going on here, because once it gets started, everybody's talking. 
And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think. 
But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard. 
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida, and you can introduce that queen. 
The high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives. 
So the idea is we can make advertising useful, not just annoying, right? 
It's not very challenging any more. 
Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open. 
Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process, but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. 
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn't even understand. 
People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?" 
(Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together. 
That's what he does. 
The oil will never run out. 
Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again, "It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch, and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever." 
I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery, starting out with a thousand TEDTalks. 
Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him. 
Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid? 
And I say, "Computer, would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job. 
(Laughter) Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib. 
So, this is a map of 714 students and their friendship ties. 
People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train. 
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. 
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. 
These are animals that died in the process, but have no commercial value. 
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture, the paje is the most important person in the community. 
And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created, so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old, willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk, basically, and you're in. 
Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10? 
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile. 
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending. 
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. 
I'm just showing the New York Times website here. 
Because we don't prioritize our psychological health. 
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it. 
Having great components is not enough, and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components. 
You see it already. Immediately you go in, the reflective symmetry in the water. 
And that's just regret about tattoos. 
(Applause). 
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. 
In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. 
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world. 
We added a new central park, 70 acres in size, to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. 
And you're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself. 
It must be a machine." 
What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed? 
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs, but the main point here is that -- (Laughter) there's a lot of them here, I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong, positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water, and how harmful they are, how much death they cause per untreated infection. 
How many other people? 
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. 
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean, this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably. 
Like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself. 
We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair, and we're going to hire you guys to do this." 
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. 
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act. 
And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this. 
Of course, computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry, while typewriter makers have vanished. 
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world. 
Here is an innovation, a design innovation. 
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened" but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted, I suppose, manifestation of racially-based voting. 
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men." 
Even with preschoolers -- Richard Davidson did that in Madison. 
Thank you. 
There is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying. 
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today. 
And already today -- this is 25,000 images. 
And that's what I look at with my photographic work. 
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?" 
There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals, but the evidence for people could not be clearer. 
He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot, garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. 
All of these technologies we can use. 
And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all. 
A lot of people are getting together, and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign. 
CA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk. 
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world, and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. 
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters. 
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage. 
And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation. 
And the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that. 
I work for the Red Cross and I'm a physical therapist. 
We were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law. 
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate. 
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries, what creates the starchiness inside of a grain, why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide. 
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds, we need to construct neural maps. 
"The Snail." 
So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me. 
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. 
Thank you. (Applause) Thanks very much. (Applause) Two years ago, I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe. 
I know algebra can be complicated. 
And then many more steps later, baby steps, they'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on, and they'd eventually touch the snake. 
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image. 
You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. 
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases. 
I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption, one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. 
Or if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride," it could create a six-fingered man. 
If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money, they become less interested in pursuing the case. 
And perfumery shows you that can’t be true, because if it were like that it wouldn’t be an art, OK? 
So, in four generations, one, two, three, four and then back. 
It's important that, if our feelings match reality, we make better security trade-offs. 
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen, who did his famous experiments with gulls, where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak -- if he made a bigger, oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder. 
And this is what he got painted. 
Think about everything it has brought us. 
And it's part of what TEDWomen does. 
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers. 
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes, in the last decade, in fact. 
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?" 
The word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons. 
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever, but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen. 
But there are, of course, pitfalls, and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them. 
And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter. 
They even got the first -- well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone. 
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age. 
I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood, whether they were buildings I liked or not. 
Africans have already got a lot of aid. 
It's something much bigger. 
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, made out of completely inexpensive materials. 
But unfortunately, we need this system in part. 
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture? 
And so my work, really, is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution. 
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. 
Not only the mother suffers, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffers too. 
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. 
This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. 
PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction, the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer, but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy, and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence.

We could probably hear it, if we tune in." 
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being. 
(Laughter) There's always a catch. 
And you shoot in seven days. 
So, what is cancer, first of all? 
This is an image of the planet Earth. 
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you. 
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness, so that even though people might be getting infected, they'd be infected with mild strains. 
The first move is going to be what? 
You're going to sort of breathe life into it. 
It inhales oxygen, just like we do. 
Who could ever wish it on their own? 
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. 
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen, this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important.

Similarly, let's look at a granola bar. 
Sharmeen is actually here. 
You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons.

That's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition, which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. 
So, we went back. 
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment. 
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule.

And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by. 
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. 
In finance, we know what to do with assets that are risky.

How do you say whether this guy understands or not? 
So I've been looking at this in more detail. 
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. 
Well, we're approaching 2015, so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?

There's the continent Africa. 
With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain. 
They're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people. 
And we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities. 
We don't have that. So that's one problem. 
I'm very passionately interested in the human future, on the Moon and Mars particularly, and elsewhere in the solar system.

So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, and when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours, and all of a sudden, had this money to make these kits. 
You need a guide. 
They just don't want to know that they're doing that. 
So this is something that we've been working on. 
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting, lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up -- basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. 
If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years, then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.

We have to let that old story go so that a new story, a truer story, can be told. 
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees, the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops, for the people, but also helps the trees.

So please join me for a minute of silence. 
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems?

But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions, get out of our ideological boxes. 
This is art." 
Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. 
And then you heard the original. 
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer. 
TR: Thanks. 
(Laughter) Unfortunately, I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes, on Fox News, saying exactly the same thing, but seriously. 
(Applause) Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last 28 years. 
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon. 
So go to it! 
As long as kids are playing computer games, graphics is getting better and better and better. 
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow. 
I work direct with the right brain. 
Underneath this, like the story of the swan, is a million things very difficult to do. 
While you're waiting around for your nuclear, you have to run the regular electric power grid, which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. 
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level, and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment. 
You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. 
It's hard for me to talk about, and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about, so much so that no one's talking about it. 
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids. 
I summoned my courage and poise and said, "Yes, but could you let me know, what actually do you sell?" 
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day. 
By the way, all these weird names -- I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures, okay, just the popular names. 
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession. 
I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works, well, that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much. 
Less and less phosphorus will be available. 
"You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. 
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. 
And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy. 
On average, in Mayank's family, they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best, and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap. 
Now, interesting that no single person does that, or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it. 
You should have always a structure of living and working together. 
Who is accountable for this process? 
I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA. 
It's already with us. 
But as early as 1968, this visionary man, Robert Kennedy, at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign, gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. 
And he said, "I'll prove it. 
There is a practice called female circumcision. 
So, don’t look backwards. That’s my only recommendation here. 
So will evil prevail? Is that the question? 
This is Dimitri. 
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage. 
The first one is happening right here in Chicago. 
Now this time on TV you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke," you have "Andy Griffith," you have domestic shows all about comfort. 
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around. 
It was very green, it was very peppery. 
Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown, her turning away, hiding her ravaged face in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi." 
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral. 
It can save over 600,000 children every year. 
Again, we could supply the content for it. 
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos. 
We need to help to lift them out of poverty. 
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something, what they really do is do a series of experiments. 
But that can't be what made the difference. 
Everybody was grabbing something. 
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. 
(Laughter) Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it, I ordered a cup of coffee, which the waiter brought over promptly. 
What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part -- only in part -- by their genes, in part by their culture -- the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture, namely their peer group -- as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today, that's what kids care about -- and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge, by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero; chance events as you live your life. 
So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way, besides some entertaining insights about human desire. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. 
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean. 
If you believe that I am my connectome, I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome. 
And they come and give the Molas -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says, "I'm not threatening, but I need a massage." 
(Laughter) So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. 
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. 
And you think about it, you know, grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason, so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty. 
Your plant can blow up. 
But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas, because you have plenty of natural gas. 
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say is, fear is a bad advisor. 
I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen, the huge giant bathtubs. 
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room. 
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations, sororities, locutions like "the family of man," you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin. 
It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator. 
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. 
Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely. 
CA: Thank you so much. (Applause) (Applause) In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany, if you owned a typewriter, you had to register it with the government. 
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars. 
So I've really overshot my budget here. 
It's very cold outside. 
Back to you, Henry. 
Because if you only have the Iranian passport, you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms, you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea. 
You become pathetic. 
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. 
It's between buildings. 
(Bird singing) Now, let's hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them. 
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization. 
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. 
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally, appropriately, interestingly. 
So, you’ll see there’s a problem here, something that is illogical. 
Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin, turn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great. 
Technology has been our friend. 
And another story of the cylinder begins. 
I think the economics are pretty clear on this. 
(Music) (Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation of what it's like. 
Why are you going to do X, Y or Z. 
And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource, you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?" 
So I decided that, instead of creating a product, what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers. 
So those are all natural causes of climate change. 
The next day, the land looked like this. 
And the year I went to school, my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. 
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral, we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. 
Do we want a society where everything is up for sale, or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy? 
Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing into what they can't do, helps them focus on finding their own voice. 
And this movie here shows this competition between molecules. 
We didn't let the stores know we were coming. 
That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country. 
The most familiar charge is electric charge. 
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week. 
No. Nah. No. 
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree. 
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle. 
And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. 
So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you, 200 people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven, and everybody's saying, "Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?" 
And then we have intentions. 
And it gets even more extreme. 
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times, and all too often very bloody times. 
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California. 
I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. 
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan, then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere. 
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico -- Michoacan is a very colorful state. 
There was sort of a movie made about it recently. 
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. 
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957. 
And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is. 
We all were at that age. 
Which one would you like the most? 
(Laughter) (Applause) I had a plan, and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo. 
This is no different. 
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters. 
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides. 
Photography's extraordinarily powerful. 
This is European space agency Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water, we have ice. 
I took a translator with me, and went to this village, found the grandmother, sat down with her. 
We imagine there are only two choices: either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation. 
We would like it to become a large, collectively generated database of do-it-yourself information on smart materials. 
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels." 
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains. 
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. 
There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model. 
I was spending all of my time with these young men. 
And those are not 20 percent by 2020. 
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies; 27 will die during my talk. 
There's two things you can do to help stop this -- a simple thing and a complicated thing, an easy thing and a hard thing. 
I could use it as a kid to do my homework. 
So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today, but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts? 
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt. 
We married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program. 
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment. 
As you may have noticed, our elections in Canada are a complete joke. 
And I'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area, looking at the impact of shipping on whales. 
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s. 
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking, persistent, creative, empowered. 
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson. 
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation, was going berserk, and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became, and frantic. My God. 
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100. 
And after about six weeks, I finished, painted, mounted my own dodo skeleton. 
Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher." 
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets. 
You should all have one in your kitchen, beside your Turbochef. 
In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. 
And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this, only one to finish it. 
And multiply that by 10,000, then you end up at 14 billion. 
In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant. 
But it's really hard, once you ski down, to get back up. 
(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all. 
(Laughter) So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly, so I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important." 
It's on the input side. It's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news. 
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines, and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing. 
But that's not what I want to talk to you about, because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease, our ability to understand why we get sick, and even develop drugs. 
Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture. 
People have talked about it a lot, and they've said good and bad and indifferent things about it. 
So that's a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch. 
And one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity. 
About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, "My life sucks." 
So, thank you very much. 
It will know us, and that's good. 
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood. 
And at the same time, there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries. 
A seat works in a two-dimensional world, where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK? 
Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles. 
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. 
Actually, below that yellow sign -- I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was "Coca-Cola" there. 
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water. 
One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot. 
What you want to do is to aggregate it all together. 
And next year, toilet paper. 
There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. 
We mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live, countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer. 
They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can. 
One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. 
This is a drug called reboxetine. 
And you might remember, some of you, how the cars were back then, and it was a common problem of overheating. 
Thank you. 
He went back to the streets of Kinshasa; I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ... 
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. 
Why don't you let your family stay home, because you do know that you get a 30-day leave. 
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?" 
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels. 
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know -- I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes. 
If you want to have total personalization, you have to be totally transparent. 
After leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. 
You don't need to worry about knowing anything. 
If I drop the card face up, like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK. 
RT: My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence? 
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons. 
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. 
You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience. 
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. 
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty useful public health intervention. 
And people in white hats sailing boats. 
(Applause) It's a great honor to be here. 
Clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until 2008, when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light -- that is, light with energies a million times higher than your standard x-ray scan. 
Well I'm afraid not. 
What do you call the leader of a republican country? 
I would feel the abdomen. 
Microphones enabled singers, in particular, and musicians and composers, to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. 
When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. 
Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denominator decreases impact. 
(Laughter) NP: Now you can put y'all hands down. 
(Laughter) Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. 
So stay tuned for further information. 
And that's why we think the animals live longer. 
And we all think our kids will be especially talented. 
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces. 
A few years later, I was invited to be the director of the museum, and after I got over that -- "Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" -- I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that curated museum experience. 
I felt that if I could manage without medication, I could prove that, after all, I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake. 
I was an unlikely person to be doing this. 
And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. 
My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. 
And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too. 
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout. 
It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in, which is more women, more voice, more equality. 
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. 
Oops! ... 
What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story. 
Here's a typical street view. 
Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth -- that's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. 
The other is power diffusion, the way power is moving from all states West or East to non-state actors. 
RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever. 
I am 17 years old and I am a nuclear physicist, which may be a little hard to believe, but I am. 
And I looked at her, I remember that day, and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline. 
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial, and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape, the rape victim got on the stand and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man." 
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. 
And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi. 
Can you break your culture of silence? 
Then once you're on the ground, you fold up the wings, drive it home, park it in your garage. 
And why can they serve that much? 
In other words, early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument, that's a fact. 
What we ultimately took away from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention. 
What we saw was a natural experiment. 
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. 
How come no one's really heard of you?" 
Daisy Bell: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ... ♫ Aaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces, and we fed them into another Turk request. 
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. 
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -- which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal. 
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders, even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. 
And this was the point at which my graduate adviser said, "Whoa! Hold on. Slow down." 
And sometimes these are fun, right? 
The other thing is, we love batteries. 
(Applause) Back in 1992, I started working for a company called Interval Research, which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley. 
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network. 
It was like Dante's "Inferno." 
So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. 
If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf -- it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. 
We develop better decision-making ability if we play more. 
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries. 
So that if you sit down on my chair, whether you're five feet tall or six foot six, it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. 
So many books actually have been written over the years. 
Time to go beyond the goods and the services, and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service? 
So Europe is not just an example now to emulate; it's an enemy to fight and to resist. 
We often think linearly. 
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century. 
In fact, there have been three independent evaluations of this now. 
So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity, means that there's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor. 
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities. 
I thought, well that's not good enough. 
Hardly anyone in South America did. 
But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet, and the router card was down. 
And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars. 
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it. 
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. 
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance, in our vocabulary, you know, 30-odd years later: wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells. 
So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead. 
If you're right where the bomb went off, you will be vaporized. And that's -- I'm just telling you, this is not good. 
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961. 
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet. 
I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. 
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing. 
Here, for instance, is trust. 
For that, bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers, to lions, to certain African elephants and to pandas. 
'Thank you for coming, Steve. 
Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED. 
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. 
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history. 
So those seem like two bifurcated problems, but I kind of started to think about, you know, what is obesity and hunger? What are both those things about? 
In contrast, the up-and-down quarks have very large masses, and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms. 
I went out and did a lit review, 3,000 articles on the key word "slavery." 
Thank you. 
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me. 
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things. 
In all hunter-gatherer societies today, there's a foraging division of labor between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females. 
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right." 
I spent six years thinking about that, but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons." 
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap. 
I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy, to take back our democracy. 
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine. 
This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves. 
I was born in 1971. 
(Laughter) "We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. 
There's a lot of activity in India. 
My dad's the guy with the cigarette. 
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red, overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything. (Laughter) And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" 
I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. 
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug, then if we give them a chemical to block this protein, then we can treat them again with the same drug. 
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic. 
When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine, a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing. 
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago, stem cells from the amniotic fluid, and the placenta, which have those properties. 
What did it do? 
Here are some examples. 
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed." 
I used to deal with intelligence agencies, and I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence, and with a straight face, they'd look at me and they'd say, "What aren't you getting?" (Laughter) I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem." 
(Laughter) So, he wouldn't say much. 
I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done. 
And as the contractions run together, you can get these spasms, and that's when you start getting these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening. 
"No ... not at all." 
A little break. 
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. 
This year they have received only six centimeters. 
That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. 
Which is why you react the way you do, because it looks impossible. 
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. 
It looks like this. 
Now this is an interesting chart, and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes -- accelerate. 
They can indict your ass. 
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. 
It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live. 
We can't afford to pull back from the world. 
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. 
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said, "You know what you should do with this, Madhav? 
And we can do that. There is a huge network all over the world fighting to stop this project. 
(Laughter) So think about this, right? 
Technology is not destiny. 
He believed that he could, in fact, catalog the human face. 
And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. 
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding. 
The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors. 
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. 
Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.

And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K., which incidentally showed that when you do this, you do not just make a room that's suitable for hearing-impaired children, you make a room where behavior improves, and results improve significantly, this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room, if you don't have one, costs 90,000 pounds a year. 
But this is not enough to make a difference, right? 
When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world, after China and the United States. 
This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer, some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs, and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market. 
But now, with the functionality that we get in these chips, we can begin to look for potential new treatments. 
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart, the whole nature, of this terrible tragedy that is taking place, that people are tending to avoid, because they are fatigued, and they really don't quite know what the solutions are. 
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. 
Where are real price increments? 
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. 
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components. 
It's going to sashay away to live to fly another day. 
And two weeks later I received a text message: "You're going to America." 
Elders came to me and said, "Are you running from the police?" 
I think we all know what it is that we want to hear about. 
In six years now, we have four schools, one junior college, 1,100 children coming from 28 slums and four orphanages. 
And they don't perceive even those as what they really are, namely electrical crackles. 
My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet, green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. 
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders, most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working, intelligent people who really want to solve problems, but once they get there, they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking. 
The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan, Nenet Katcha, is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell. 
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008.

When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide. 
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science. 
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.' "But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. 
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive. 
We're able to gather information about our environment. 
Most importantly, what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox. 
He stood over six feet tall. 
I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body, so I learned how to do this. 
Just to put that in some perspective, that's the weight of two normal human brains. 
Because while people are talking about data, making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade, or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers, or some dude to build a better baseball team, I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school, to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her. 
The cost has come down by half every year. 
And I thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time. 
We did include some things that are hopefully useful. 
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem. 
But, no, look what I found in the textbooks. 
The sketches are in black and white here, but in my mind they have colors. 
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. 
BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. 
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. 
And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance, like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements, and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. 
It's so clear, yet they're in denial." 
All of these things were made during the last 75 years. 
You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. 
I wanted to get back where the romance was. 
(Laughter) Perspective is a very powerful thing. 
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet, but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something, to actually become dynamic, as we'll see here. 
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. 
We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern. 
You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art, or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to, would like to be called, artists. 
You can only do them one at a time. 
And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. 
Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009. 
(Laughter) Thought the guy was going to come back and be like, "We've been looking for you for 200 years." 
We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. 
A whole new symmetry. 
Nothing like this existed in China, where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity, and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination, which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing. 
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. 
Let's consider the big three: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis. 
Was it the planes or the volcano, the grounded planes or the volcano? 
The particulars in poems are like the particularities, the personalities, that distinguish people from one another. 
On top of this, when you get so many animals so close together, it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse. 
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level. 
He certainly doesn't look like me. 
And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. 
Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them. 
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people, the stuff that they can't do themselves. 
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head." 
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. 
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi]. 
Global warming hoopla became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science -- partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony. 
But in five to ten years we're going to start see some very profound changes. 
But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight, just for the fun of it, and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles, and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle, and immediately, figure out its speed, and the turning radius, and so on, which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip -- (Laughter) -- with my three sons, young sons, helping me, but ridiculing the whole thing very much. 
Life is short, you know. 
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. 
And that's your view of a tomato. 
And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again, and so, as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. 
That's one angle; here's another angle. 
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends, which leads to more profit. 
What we have here is a list of old viruses. 
So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super, hyper — (Laughter) (Applause) to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function. 
I'm not an economist, very much not, but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation -- (Laughter) -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars. 
I was coming at it from a different perspective, where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. 
That's what you might think. 
You say, "How is that possible?" 
And we're seeing people transform their lives. 
It's mind not matter, brain not brawn, ideas not things. 
Take the travel service Nextpedition. 
So it wasn't about symmetry. 
And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. 
(Applause) Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular. 
And he took me to a campaign headquarters — the governor of Illinois was running for the presidency — and introduced me to American electoral politics. 
And we finally have the studies, one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth" that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity, and found a much higher, stronger correlation between the latter two. 
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature, that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases. 
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. 
They are a kind of social capital. 
And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED. 
Now, I can think of some possible experiments. 
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency. 
It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us, it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures, where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature. 
You know, we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live, and I find that's not true. 
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance? 
Patient: A square and a circle. 
You've made the money you need. 
I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks. 
I said, I also have a pottery. 
At that age, I also learned about what an animator was. 
And India wants to be a knowledge society. 
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. 
And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- "Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with? 
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. 
The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players, about what everybody does -- far more detail than you'd ever get from any website. 
I mean, how long did it take them to build that? 
It started to become hard to raise operational costs, operational budgets. 
I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later, I was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack.

So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. 
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors. 
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter, but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network, and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?" 
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach, and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. 
(Music) So I have a gift I want to share with you today, a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed, and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. 
So, there's a fairly simple solution to this. 
EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much. 
That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. 
Are we safer today? 
They did a CT scan. 
(Laughter) Then I said, all this is good, but I want to paint like a real painter. 
You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. 
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results. 
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan. 
Which would you like, if you could have just one? 
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees. 
And there's referential and non-referential compassion. 
Because, yes, if you see something like this, then all right, fine, I'm going to call it life -- no doubt about it. 
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. 
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence, which is not much different from what a kid does. 
They're not affronted by differences, they're fascinated by them, and that is a huge shift in mindset, and once you feel it, you want it to happen a lot more. 
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. 
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence; it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform. 
They're showing us what can be done with mobile, digital technologies. 
Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate? 
They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer, the engine, the dash, the radio, etc., and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network. 
That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire. 
What's going on in the U.S. government? 
And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends. 
Now, my concern is, we Dems, too often, not so much. 
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature. 
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff. 
Probably starting with sports games, which are going to become much more interactive. 
Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. 
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today. 
They learn English, they learn how to be teachers, they learn computers, and they are my guides. 
But the same goes for renewables as well.

This is people designing their own experiences. 
So where does that feeling come from? 
I believe a story there has to be told. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. 
(Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. 
And again, it's another one of these white masses. 
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them. 
Honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage, and they're killed by their family for it. 
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?" 
I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals. 
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability. 
But lots of people now live to 90 or 100, unless they shake hands too much or something like that. 
I just happened to get my education in a little different way. 
So we did this. 
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood-boosting bottled water? 
And so we've started doing that, and we have to restructure the industry. 
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars. 
If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor, all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee, yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together, I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something. 
So let your haters hate, you know what, and make your change, because I know you can. 
So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist. 
Even so, up until very recently, nobody worried about GPS spoofers. 
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening. 
What a fish. 
And then I asked the usual question: "Is it a priority? 
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach, you don't always end up in a place like this. 
That is to say, it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day. 
I was a noticeable nobody. 
NM: Well, um... 
They are examples and schools of social life, because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence, following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voices and instruments. 
It will go perfectly on the day of the walk. 
Your kids are easy to train. 
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. 
And then we have others working in these other related programs. 
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold. 
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se. 
In some it is hot. 
(Applause) It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky. 
So why? 
The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this: a gas station on orbit. 
I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island -- and this is true of practically every part of the world -- which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever. 
And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. 
Now after I play back these humpback calls, I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up because they're so low in frequency that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise. 
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure. 
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively. 
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now -- these high-powered tools -- that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome. 
BF: Good. 
Others battle oppressive societies. 
When you're talking about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

Let's see somebody else, a great conductor. 
There was an interest in what was going on. 
Rather, they're taken as primitive, and you build up the world from there. 
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease. 
We did all kinds of research. 
Simple. 
Now it seems simple, but actually I think in our society and culture in general, we have a huge problem with intent. 
If there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones, but even if there's no rose there, you'll have the memory of a molecule. 
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face. 
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision. 
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected. 
And I swam through that night and into the next day. 
In the words of the poet Longfellow, "the human voice is the organ of the soul." 
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity, but we actually haven't really changed the design of them that much since the 1950s.

Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. 
You know, incubators for infants, for example. 
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally, globally, through our English channel. 
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea. 
The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. 
This is a very famous picture taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve, December 24th, 1968, when I was about eight months old. 
We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off. 
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top. 
"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power." 
He had to restore his dignity, and he did so, and initially, although I was disappointed, I grew to admire that stance.

In Rwanda, they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners' bowels. 
We really like the human being story a lot. 
And when we enter into this century, you'll find more than half of mankind down here. 
And if that's true, it means that we're hard-wired for music, that we can find it anywhere, that there is no such thing as a musical desert, that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis, and that is marvelous. 
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on. 
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. 
These are two women. 
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock. 
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being.

There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. 
How do we go faster? 
Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. 
Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find. 
And indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate. 
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt. 
It's like a managed competition of sleep. 
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge. 
He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us, these strong ties in our lives, actually have a homogenizing effect on us. 
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy. 
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer. 
It's a crippling time. 
Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. 
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing. 
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case, how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation. 
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules, like, for example, the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body. 
So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad. 
Could we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for?

It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. 
So if I asked you, for example, what was the Obama Administration policy that caused massive changes across the country, what would you say? 
Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago, and a beautiful dream 40 years ago, but now with the huge advances in information technology, with the massive changes in behavioral economics, with all that we know about how you advance well-being, that if we combine those insights of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible, and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature, while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do, it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago. 
He's, I hope, a little bit dignified, but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter) And energetic, I hope, too.

So when we started this a couple of years ago now, we've had a lot of people come up to us who said, "This is a very interesting but crazy idea, and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon." 
Note the textbook, the sage on the stage, and the sleeping guy in the back. (Laughter) Just like today. 
We know from the Framingham studies, that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight. 
Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot. 
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba. 
This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping. 
The one new thing is this essay. 
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. 
He was 35 years old. 
And so with the standard method, the cells do fire, they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code. 
So there's an opportunity to change that. 
They're packed with information. 
Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device" which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm. 
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex. 
It will replace or be able to be used for that.

And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina, which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. 
We are inveterate storytellers. 
But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor, do you trust your mayor?" 
You didn't trust information very much. 
We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics, we still need really interesting topography, and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells. 
Of course we also, particularly in the last decade, managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets, in a chain of global trade. 
For example, this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon. 
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No, I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale, so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space. 
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it, which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly. 
So, he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours, and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here. 
The technology was there. 
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway, the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. 
And what could it do if it could look back at us? 
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. 
They're all cameras pointed down, and they slowly scan across as the Earth rotates underneath. 
And it was this interaction between that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting. 
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus. 
The phrase "first-born son" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. 
So thank you very much. 
If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief. 
So what are we to do about this space-age material, at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics? 
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. 
The more the angle between here and here opens up -- and nowadays, with a screen in front of you, you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline, so we keep it at more or less the same level -- but you transfer weight off your tailbones. 
Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight, and as such, they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize. 
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. 
There are so many things to be happy about. 
If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete, they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete. 
"How can the news possibly be worse?" 
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term. 
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife. 
And in the last six months, we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. 
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other, and where they contact each other, those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. 
The Q&amp;A session after a post-op presents data is often a blood bath. 
Court: Sleep. 
But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. 
We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth, visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. 
I like to play jazz, a little funk, and hip hop, a little pop, a little R&amp;B, a little Latin, African. 
Some rough research suggests this could unlock around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K. 
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫ ♫ this stage fright is real. ♫ ♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫ ♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫ ♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫ ♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫ ♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫ ♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫ ♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫ (Laughter) ♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine you all without clothes. ♫ ♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows. ♫ 
Oh look, a child porn proxy server. 
They're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon. 
So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist, but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side. 
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it, and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it. 
I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school. 
It's not just the fish, though, that are disappearing. 
We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off. 
Do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run? 
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard. 
Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work, but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. 
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. 
You check your email while you're sitting here. 
Spend it on one of your teammates this week. 
And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. 
That was the reason that I valued my daughter. 
But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here. 
Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. 
Can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize? 
This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West, at least. 
And I can only try to speculate on how he did it. 
And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids. 
The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments, which have fallen for two consecutive years. 
This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred. 
There's -- no reactor's been even built to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States for 25 years. 
Yes, you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different. 
In the long term, people who got the free bed nets, one year later, were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars. 
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. 
It's buying it. 
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space. 
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. 
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. 
But they are. 
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day. 
If you take China, and you just take Beijing, you can see on that traffic system, and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. 
And I just wanted to play it for you. 
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it, because I didn't know what I was putting myself into. 
The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children. 
has been with me ever since I was a child. 
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.

Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth. 
I should say, it is more practical than people think. 
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.

We're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram appeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803, all the way up to 2008. 
It's good news if you care about democracy. 
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. 
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. 
We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. 
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. 
After I say -- let me refresh you -- "have you no shame?" 
JA: Even on the coldest winter days. 
Because our home is the universe, and we are the universe, essentially. 
So these are kind of sunlamps. 
We know more about mobile operating systems, but what we really need is a moral operating system. 
It elevates MOOTW -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy, because that's how you're going to shrink that gap. 
(Laughter) FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story, when the woman called and said, "Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head." 
So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums. 
But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe. 
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green. 
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. 
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher. 
Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this -- often military psychiatrists -- and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. 
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates. 
Now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops, and elaborates their skills and abilities, but also try to understand the origins of impairment, and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult. 
And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister." 
And he said, "I'm her uncle, she's fine, you can leave now." 
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break. 
You can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons, or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr, or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. 
So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise. 
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. 
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. 
Patients are experts on their own experience, and they can share that experience with others. 
And this still goes on as I think I told you last year. 
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already, and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have. 
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again. 
The Internet has no business plan, never did. 
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. 
I feel like I've got something to say and something to share. 
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? 
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is. 
What we see with, say, chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. 
I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country? 
This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias. 
Do another three hours' work. 
The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art, at least the art of fiction, was, was working with kids. 
Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right. 
And that worked pretty well. 
The car pays for itself. 
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born -- we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby, ensuring that they live healthy, successful lives.

I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force, I'm attracted to her. 
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. 
And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had, which is that they're moving these positions -- whether it's Proctor &amp; Gamble or Accenture, whatever -- they're moving a million shares of something through the market. 
One more mind will be unlocked. 
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism. 
And on your side -- I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis. 
And that's not what the debate should be about. 
It's a dream. And it became a dream also. 
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so, save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves. 
5:10. 
It's used to change the scene. 
And seeing this reinforces, for me, that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them. 
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive, and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on. 
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go. 
If you have biological problems we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale. 
Thanks. 
I have talked about it a million times, but it's unbelievable. 
UNICEF reports that in 2011, 6.9 million children under five died from preventable, poverty-related diseases. 
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren, who's actually in the space. 
And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform. 
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. 
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. 
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well, so thanks very much for your time. 
About 16,000 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists; there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown. 
And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within. 
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old, looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?" 
And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device. 
In fact, I am a data nerd. 
Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set, and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. 
Don't you want to look? 
(Applause) What don't you like about this? 
You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou. 
And in the center of Kunene region is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born. 
The thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some. 
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up, and they use their teenage years to practice social skills, and at about the age of nine, the females become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant, and the males mature quite a bit later, at around 15 years of age. 
We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. 
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." 
We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be. 
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did, more regulations, less resources. 
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain. 
I mean, this could be huge. 
But that's what the math says. 
We always come up with these fantastic large-scale scupltures that actually we can also inhabit. 
We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems. 
You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique -- in other words, just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy, where we think the black hole is. 
These are some of the best skaters in the world. 
And that's simply what I did. 
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. 
This is actually a very stunning statistic. 
How many people here are over the age of 48? 
And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns, visual, such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me, or auditory images, as you are having now in relation to my words. 
And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!, which some of you have probably heard of. 
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently, and it's become the foundation of my work because, I feel like, if in a day, I can see the ocean differently, then I can evoke that same kind of change in others, especially kids. 
Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners. 
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked. 
I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn't. 
And it's been an incredible experience. 
But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live. 
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear, the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can. 
Well, I think what part of the problem is that, in Haiti, although the problem is huge, somehow we understand it, it's localized. 
But to get to that stage, where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric, but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship -- i.e. you're voting in a democracy, in an existing democracy, and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box. 
There are no contracts, no written contracts. 
And the numbers are used to make decisions. 
I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong. 
The continents move apart. They come back together. 
That's the kind of material in the deep sea. 
So what's the data? 
They even can bring with them some financing. 
I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. 
Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years, your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. 
But this is really just the beginning. 
Go to bed. 
That's all we could do. 
This cop comes after me with a rifle. 
Most people fled abroad. 
And counting off by four? 
So I'll show you really quickly, Romo actually -- he's streaming video, so you can see me and the entire TED audience. 
It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries. 
We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain. 
The queen does it all. 
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. 
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. 
But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener. 
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. 
And for the next three years, her fate will be having sex with him every day, as a favor for getting her in school. 
Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks. 
We didn't calculate that precisely, but we understand that's very expensive. 
Okay, throw that theory away. 
The first was, how did we get so fast? 
That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys." 
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year, everyone said I had changed. They asked me, what did you do that you have changed so much? 
So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers. 
In general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders, or mites, let us call them. 
Want to feed the world? 
We can download new diagnostics. 
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure. 
And that's a simple question. 
Average height, about that much above sea level. 
And at about four months old, I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss. 
When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. 
Thank you. 
I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds. 
Of course, Britain doesn't have any deserts. 
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. 
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is. 
And then they also exhibit curiosity. 
Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day. 
The information you need to do this is not secret. 
I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. 
All right. Very significant mark. 
But what we're going to focus on is this red region -- I've labeled it red here -- and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. 
A culture which is top-down, owned, where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost. 
I think that was his greatest quality. 
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on. 
And if you truly believe -- and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen. 
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998, waiting until 2011, and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice. 
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper, one for FHM magazine. 
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks, it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive. 
In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. 
They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second, and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this? 
And they do not want it fundamentally touched, although the American people are remarkably comfortable, and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans, with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable. 
(Applause) This is India, and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world, more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white, male or Christian. 
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. 
So let's start again. Let's design a product, right from the word go, and decide what we want. 
Now any physiological variable you can think of, any life history event you can think of, if you plot it this way, looks like this. 
We have confusion about what we should think about a new technology. 
(Laughter) So basically I'd completed the house. 
(Music) (Applause) CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today, so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. 
And you put it all together and what do you get? 
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people to talk about this. 
I don't mean to say that I want no choice, but many of these choices are quite artificial." 
All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted. 
It's more ideological than practical, but it turns out it's an easy question. 
Right? That would explain it, right? 
You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. 
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Video: Woof! 
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century, and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions. 
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone. 
I did that. Me! 
I would also like to tell the world that animals love. 
Not only that, transforming hunger is an opportunity, but I think we have to change our mindsets. 
And again, that's a question we can answer. 
Never was there one so fair! 
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later. 
So that's it for now. 
At night when I go to bed, 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning, I lie down, close my eyes, and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. 
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement, of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility, of making sure everything is safe. 
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression, that doesn't understand mental health. 
And it felt kind of like being president, actually. 
Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain, changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work, the things that make your software work in your brain, are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow. 
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. 
For example, if INCRA would rate South Africa right now, of course we would take a very, very close look at the youth unemployment of the country, the highest in the world. 
The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas, I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic. 
But, of course, we've seen what that does. 
And the reason was because of overfishing, and the fact that a last common grazer, a sea urchin, died. 
And by the way, mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation. 
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed over the 20th century have paid off in unexpected areas. 
Do we have any idea how we could have defeated Neanderthals if they also had language? 
(Music) OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85. 
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them. 
These, of course, are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization. 
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. 
He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked. 
I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on -- and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics. 
And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. 
I would love to, but why? 
I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people, in all the potential glory that they could be presented. 
He was just immediately caught with the situation. 
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days, and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover back on top, and they push the sand over that, and we all forget about it. 
So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural. 
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED. 
and then backtrack innovations within that. 
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. 
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip. 
So we find some investors, and they pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes, and with those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money, and with those savings, they can pay outcomes.

But we're taking something very complicated, turning it into sound, sequences of sounds, and producing something very complicated in your brain. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, Chris. 
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles. 
If you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards with a crappy house like this, you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in London. 
And they are helping each other solve these issues. 
Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. 
You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. 
And secondly, she had better be, although she did dance for a while, a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. 
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. 
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. 
Okay, so how would you solve this one? 
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do? 
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. 
And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear, and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state. 
You are not on trial. 
Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life. 
Brought in younger men. 
Our job as educators, there's some stuff we know that we can do. 
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won. 
This caused major riots in my city. 
And of course, that is not New Yorker humor. 
And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad, but I kept remaining a fan of yours. 
I can share that with my friends, with my physician. 
I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us. 
CA: And in the last year, tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening. 
And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art. 
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great," told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common: they preserve the core, they stimulate progress. 
Because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds. 
The world is fucked up. 
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right. 
And so of course I want to make it across. 
In times of change we need new alternatives, new ideas. 
Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor, 75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for. 
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. 
So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s. 
Obviously trial and error is very important. 
So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something, and the way I did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter) This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art. 
Thank you all very much. 
There's also practical use for this particular procedure. 
And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero, just doing the things that we know work. 
If you've got two of something, you add two more, you get four. 
I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score. 
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. 
Now, these are arm wrestle questions, but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really, very often, are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. 
And the answer is this thing. 
Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry -- and after the rides also. 
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps. 
That's the closest you'll probably ever get. 
And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. 
Engineers, by moving around a small number of genetic changes, were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch, so that not thousands of people would die, but tens of millions. 
But it was a terrific job. 
People are a little risk-averse. So what? 
Now, here is -- here is a representative quote from a besieged mother: "I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. 
I think I can make a guess now -- education is self-organizing system, where learning is an emergent phenomenon. 
But I really needed a support network, a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance, that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do. 
He used to pick people up here every day. 
Now we dry-coat vaccines to the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin. 
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. 
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson. 
Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate. 
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product. 
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. 
And these sub-movements are just kind of floating around, and as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent, and that's when the cognitive mind, you think, "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that." 
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. 
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it. 
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public. 
All right, so for some of you, this may be really, really out there. 
Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. 
And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better, but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing. 
Below the surface there is hard saline water. 
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible." 
So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers. 
And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important. 
And then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time. 
The adult literacy rate in China is 77 percent as compared with 48 percent in India. 
But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. 
This is another African girl's wish. 
But this is what I heard from a lot of outraged people. 
CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.) There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see. 
He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel. 
And this is what runs our infrastructure. 
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair. 
It's a pretty panel of glass. 
We had close family, good friends, a quiet street. 
The strange one looks likes this: that we live in a three-dimensional world. 
Well, they were happy as could be, because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. 
Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. 
to receive a prize from the university, and three days later, a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. 
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example. 
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. 
So roughly, we have 50 million data points for a given human brain. 
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say, "Hey, these are tools, these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette." 
(Laughter) That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen. 
You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together. 
We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. 
So I said, "Well, how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing?" 
In two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the Pimp My Carroça movement, whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school. 
It's really a hands-on experience. 
What happens is every protein in your body is charged, so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around, and then there's a detector at the end. 
CA: Franco, thank you so much. 
Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago. 
It's real. 
And we sent it off to the National Theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. 
It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin. 
Thank you. 
But the remaining question was, how? 
We're not asking important questions. 
In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community, there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing. 
One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't, tough luck. Just tough luck. 
I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice. 
I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. 
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun. 
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. 
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. 
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise. 
And that question is this. 
It also works five times better underwater. 
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. 
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. 
These are refrigerators that require no electricity; they're pot within a pot design. 
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does, but of course you need to program this thing, and of course, Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s, which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here, and this is a program in the Science Museum, just not far from here, created by Charles Babbage, that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built. 
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody. 
And so welcome to super biologics. 
But that's really big in the U.K. 
And the peace accord was signed. 
And we studied many models. 
So, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, you're just alternately heating and cooling the air. 
If we could roll that first video clip. 
We've talked about it being needle-free -- these are projections that you can't even see -- and, of course, we get around the needle phobia issue as well. 
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. 
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions. 
We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be, so they don't need to go somewhere else. 
We spark off each other. 
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs. 
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle. 
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak, looking like the Michelin Man. 
I thought I knew what fear was. 
We need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets I was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world. 
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me. 
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves. 
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents. 
And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China. 
It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations. 
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it. 
Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders, a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders, maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières, of economics and technology without borders, of education without borders, of terrorism and war without borders. 
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. 
In that sense, if we define our interests, for example, for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century, keeping an open trading system, keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas -- those were good for Britain, they were good for others as well. 
To describe this idea, we need to take a journey through the skin, starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin. 
These women would get together over video conference from all around Afghanistan from their various bases, and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing. 
This is a very interesting journey. 
In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from, say, our lungs, and then underneath, they had capillary cells, the cells in our blood vessels. 
All because of a word I said, not even said really, only repeated. 
It's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have, while about two-thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life, including health care, education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues. 
So white ball and -- finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink. 
There is the affective component, which is, "I feel for you." 
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be. 
When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. 
It's something you live with. It's something you live in. 
A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me. 
I'd been told that in an Arab town, one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized. 
We have no water whatsoever. 
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies, those lyrical claims that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings. 
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth, breastfeeding. 
What of the upstart Sport? 
I even knew at a seven-year-old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent, and people would pay that because it multiplied up. 
But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl. 
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law, then if you can use violence, if you can use violence with impunity, you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. 
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime, he isn't speaking about corruption. 
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far. 
We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference. 
Thank you for joining us today. 
And up to now, me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him. 
And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. 
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society, not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged, but by how they treat the poor, the condemned, the incarcerated. 
There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets, even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. 
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language, and then I'll draw that connection. 
We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression, Parkinson's disease, HIV. 
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory. 
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months. 
They wanted to do something about what we all know, namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. 
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. 
We'd laid 10 depots of food, literally burying food and fuel, for our return journey — the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water — and I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight, a ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap. 
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work. 
(Laughter) Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. 
Now you can also do this with soldiers. 
Now, if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind, to the point where you can get to solar, to the point where you can get to nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought. 
It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. 
I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way, but I have the potential. 
Why I said this, is the background. 
So this is what went right. 
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky. 
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question, traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars, experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets. 
There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate. 
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution. 
We talk of people as human capital. 
If you actually look at a great business, you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play. 
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. 
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what? 
At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth. 
We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience: the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread; the labeling. 
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. 
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account, but what about your core values? 
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen. 
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall. 
What happened? 
You want to be loved, but you hate everyone. 
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting -- and ex-probation officers. 
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. 
And this is, in my opinion, an example of soft power, because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. 
Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money. 
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. 
You see, late in 2009, eight years after that shooting, Raisuddin had gone on his own journey, a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
Now, what are we doing with all this information? 
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this? 
Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like. 
There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way. 
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively. 
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet, and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change. 
Those first two are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win. 
It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. 
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan. 
Child: Yeah. 
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization, as we heard earlier, it's in the brain. 
A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy. 
"Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers." 
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements. 
So there you go. That's the truth. 
So eight of us went in: four men and four women. 
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics." 
And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country, and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams, and a Jewish Nazi hunter. 
TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world, still, I feel a sense of impediment, when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level. 
It was a worldwide branding campaign. 
(Laughter) There the alternative just boggles the imagination. 
And that's something that's easy to forget. 
She never missed a day of school, K-12. 
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. 
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. 
Therefore it is important that it be real. 
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid, or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward. 
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. 
And when you try to execute these commitment devices, you realize the devil is really in the details. 
These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom, who have great clout in the religious community, have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder, because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction, a direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind. 
And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes, because you think, you know, other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact: what I do, where I do it, when I do it. 
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. 
During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. 
There was a reason for that; it was me. 
And therefore democracy has become embedded. 
We had the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War and the rise of the communist nations. 
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find? 
It's nation-based, while the threat is international. 
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before, there is a struggle. 
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier. 
So, there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself. 
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that. 
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it? 
Openness isn't the end. 
If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren't enough translators in the world. 
(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep. 
A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy. 
In this diagram, every node is a neuron, and every line is a connection. 
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. 
And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. 
Efficiency: This is data through illumination -- it's first of all an illumination device. 
Take a look at Gabby. 
And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is, and how many different life forms there are, and how there can be different life forms living in very different places, maybe even outside of this planet. 
Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫ (Laughter) Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later. 
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again. 
They come from the network structure of interconnected ideas. Keep going. 
(Laughter) Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about. 
And the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops, is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year, we're going to make 20 percent of the world production. 
Superstring theory -- what is it? 
It's hard to communicate this, and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish, because people like to go out and catch fish. 
What was the difference between Chile and Haiti? 
In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields, and since we invited him here, he felt that he has got a responsibility. 
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. 
TBL: Can you say "now"? 
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to. 
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. 
Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say, I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan. 
We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter, and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize, is very different than in the summer. 
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail. 
There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. 
If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents. 
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. 
(Laughter) When I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism of a different kind, and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind. 
Very sad, dark. 
Yet, what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house? 
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter. 
And he was what you'd call a teratologist: he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms. 
Well, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you. 
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it. 
Well, interestingly, and based on my work and others in Africa, for example, we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems, with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts, sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields, and innovations in tillage systems, we can triple, quadruple, yield levels on current land. 
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. 
So they got very interested in producing convulsions, measured types of convulsions. 
And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, "We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it." 
Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. 
The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. 
And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re-offending, then we can do something we think rather interesting. 
One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ. 
What you see over here, this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. 
And when you look at what happens to that pipeline, you start out maybe with thousands, tens of thousands of compounds. 
Later, Babbage's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense. 
Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch." 
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it. 
But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height. 
And importantly, it's a rich source of vitamin B12. 
We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines. 
But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter, as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions, because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products, they're participating in these major problems. 
Now Italian police, when this trade started, had just two boats which could go at the same speed. 
It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps: we bought the land, we dealt with the fire, and then only, we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry. 
I work with children all over the world, and that's an entirely different talk, but I want to leave you with one story that really, really inspired me. 
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. 
The accent is on the "I." 
We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right? 
Who are we? 
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of which was printer inks. 
A newly minted American citizen, he had come to believe that Stroman was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away. 
you're not really confident standing up there saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you? 
At that speed, the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace. 
You know, from physics to medicine, in particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling. 
Our circumstances are different, but you're the same as us. 
And so by reading the genome, we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. 
That seems trivial, but it's less time spent caring for patients. 
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry. 
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it. 
Death: Adam? 
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily. 
And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. 
But now we have a new situation, really what people call an asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation-state. 
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out. 
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. 
So people really, really want to learn a new language. 
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem, but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem. 
But let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen. 
And I looked at it underneath the microscope. 
And the level of construction that occurs is massive. 
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves. 
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end. 
And you're not coming back here." 
And if you think about the carbon in that, that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea and then locked away in a building product. 
Now, the simplest form of application is using our finger, but our finger has some limitations, so we've devised an applicator. 
(Laughter) And, "How swollen is your vulva?" 
Everything is everything. 
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin. 
Thank you. 
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister. 
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life. 
And the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied. 
For us lifers, as we call ourselves, our only chance for release is through commutation, which has only been granted to two women since 1989, close to 30 years ago. 
I'm going to show you what our satellite looks like: This is our satellite. 
That was not a controlled descent. 
You know what? They're just going to be sick. 
In addition to these complexities, I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. 
It was a really extraordinary moment. 
This is an example of bio-mimicry, which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. 
On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development. 
Get your friends to give one, get one. 
I mean, look: if you can show instead of just describing, that problem goes away. 
And finally, point number three: Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland, against the background of its history, its traditions, in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption, a corruption. 
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice." 
We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements, and if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground. 
Audience: Yeah. 
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive, and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously, because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. 
When I wrote a first draft of the book, I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments, and here are some of the reactions that I got: "Better get a security camera for your house." 
I think nature gave them a helping hand here. 
(Whistle) That's the rope whistle. 
And already, commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. 
And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. 
And then I work between my heartbeat, I have one-and-a-half seconds to actually move. 
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story. 
But, there is something more substantive to that. 
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. 
He said that his vote was in his heart. 
Compromise, if it's artistic, if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it's not that far away. 
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. 
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral. 
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore, and so they turn off the television and don't watch. 
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey. 
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan. 
As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face. 
We have reached peak child. 
And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North, actually near Afghanistan, and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past, Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. 
Because this is what tomorrow could look like: bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced. 
(Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. 
We think it's very important. 
It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. 
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person -- except in some of these special cases. 
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world. 
And that was just a small percentage of the dead. 
Now, the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. 
Very soon, the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network. 
She was with me on my lifeboat. 
(Laughter) The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen. 
I'm just a clock watcher. 
That's what we need to do. 
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet. 
The red is modern conflict, conflicts within states. 
Up there is the skeleton, which is actually what it's trying to do. 
This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. 
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks, when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. 
Could I have the second little video clip? 
59 wakes up on the wrong side of the bed. 
The consequence? 
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. 
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies, this time from people who had a disease, ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease. 
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one, is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online, so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. 
Cities don't worry about number one. 
All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. 
And it's not that he's not eating, it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. 
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it. 
We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. 
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said, by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. 
And what do I mean by that? 
Ooh, that was very quick. 
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran, things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about. 
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. 
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia. 
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor. 
So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign. 
It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. 
It's as though you made something resonate within them. 
They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy, and that was a really radical thing to do. 
Egyptians on social media were wondering, "If Tunisia did it, why can't we?" 
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life, all sorts of backgrounds. 
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones. 
That, and I will say this to the scientists, that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas. 
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know, and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor. 
However, some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it, because, they said, simply, it's become more difficult to control them. 
They're there in thousands in every office. 
It's solvable, not by being a Democrat, not by being a Republican. 
(Applause) In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which you see here the campus. 
Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help, think about this. 
And many people found this amazing. 
All across the boreal, it's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples, and a rich and varied culture. 
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. 
The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block. 
I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so: we are right in the middle, and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. 
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship. 
This has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive -- the patent issued, we're happy to say. 
But maybe there is another problem as well. 
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should, because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather, or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause) BL: So the next step was to design an experiment, which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so, Amy, can you tell us what the game was, and the puzzle that you set the bees? 
(Laughter) (Applause) Bye-bye. 
Women are 51 percent of humankind. 
And also because that's where, in terms of our own self-interest, we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond, our responsibility to the rest of the world. 
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation? 
"What, ma?" 
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy: there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power, and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power. 
It becomes very portable. 
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time. 
On the right, you see it looks very ugly, the cells continue to grow, the normal ones stop. 
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. 
And I, you know." (Laughter) "So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you." 
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires. 
No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly, was the discovery of the Higgs boson. 
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. 
And it is important. 
It can't possibly be that bad. 
The sky is blue without clouds. 
It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. 
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent. 
The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean, and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean. 
With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. 
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video. 
And over there I experienced other people's suffering, up close and personal, immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories, and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. 
(Applause) I'm going to speak about a tiny, little idea. 
It's not quite finished yet. 
There was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital, as it changed over time. 
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine, and let me show you how it works. 
Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones: environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics. 
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation, and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty, and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed. 
All right, I can see a rhinovirus -- and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode -- but what about different rhinoviruses? 
This is where it's really central to our lives. 
Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle. 
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust. 
And an especially important challenge that I've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals, such as psychiatrists and psychologists, particularly in the developing world. 
And that is a wonderful thing there. 
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of. 
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. 
I've talked for three minutes. 
So this, swine flu -- pink. 
That means it doesn't mix with the water. 
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic, take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove. 
They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel, and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily, because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas, 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. 
In my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound, it's ultimately grounded in cynicism. 
And I understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next, between people like me and my father's generation, but there's no tradition in Caribbean life of memoirs or biographies. 
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process, and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. 
You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton. 
In one, I used NASA supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft, and in the other I was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies. 
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells, if one of them acquires new mutations, which allow them to grow more quickly, acquire nutrients more successfully, invade the body, they'll be selected for by evolution. 
It's called AskNature.org. 
We can't really afford to lose that many more. 
I mean, I find information just too interesting. 
I've got data to back up all these assertions, by the way. 
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility. 
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question: what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us? 
And this is a person who is alive. 
They're designed to recover from an injury. 
Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg, without even wanting to do it. 
There is a single candle flickering in the center; by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions. 
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well, in beautiful, fragile, protected areas like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found. 
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby. 
Now, whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers, or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells, nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to. 
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster. 
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. 
Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?" 
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. 
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. 
I can start plugging in lots of lights. 
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this. 
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years, built urbanism on top of its parking lots. 
Why do I blame the Queen? 
And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. 
And that's what I'm going to talk about, how a small change leads to a very big revolution. 
A few energy geeks spread out across the room. 
It's OK. We are in the light. 
So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children, and they found that, across space and time, all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow. 
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless. 
So we started talking about climate change. 
Now, James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon, killed James Elroy's mother. 
What are you in America doing about it? 
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know, just like our own species. 
And finally, some people say, well, you know, I don't feel like a bunch of cells, you know. I'm conscious. 
There's Francis up on the upper right, and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me. 
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. 
It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. 
Kevin, can you help? 
Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be 350. 
Who could sleep that night? 
How many people have ever hitchhiked? 
And by answering that question, I think we can take something extremely powerful away. 
So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue. 
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain, we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans, and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones. 
In our homes, we've lost touch with food. 
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people. 
And I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. 
Stories cut across all boundaries, like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja," which were very popular throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the Balkans and Asia. 
That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid. 
I have a characterization. 
It was black or white. 
And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject. 
He's whispering into your ears. 
And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. 
You can take a runner like Ann Trason, or Nikki Kimball, or Jenn Shelton, you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. 
The water level of the lake has started drying up. 
Which made me go, "Yippee!" 
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type, and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward. 
But the amazing thing was -- Feynman had to leave a little early. 
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda. 
Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems, community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown, crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle. 
So, yeah. 
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it. 
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the United States than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined -- about 100,000. 
This is Nepal and Tibet. 
And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too. 
It should be more like private accounting. 
For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people. 
And in that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs, and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy. 
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them, but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping, and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet. 
We don't want to have what there is in the West. 
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer. 
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000, and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in. 
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together, you get one of these, and I make them out of glass. 
(Laughter) And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism, which reflects another value of Newtonian physics, which is objectivity. 
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. 
And finally, I get a call last year, and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams. 
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra, and we're going to do serious experiments. 
(Laughter) So I take a bow. I salute with my hand. 
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get, the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining, I know what they deserve: everything humanly possible. 
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991. 
59 wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower. 
You understand flyovers? Yeah? 
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. 
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again -- instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins, wins the New York City Marathon, goes home with a big fat check. 
There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door. 
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. 
I mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe. 
But the kids do ask me -- and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? 
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not. 
And each one is making their own individual effort. 
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings. 
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way. 
(Laughter) You can have culture without exchange. 
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling." 
As it turns out, he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher Immanuel Kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation, that every answer begets more questions. 
So here come some renewables. 
Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it? 
Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. 
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure. 
So a hundred surgeries later, he looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me. I'm in so much pain." 
And I shut that part down. 
The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. 
And it turns out that the less-frequent "arghs" are, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating -- except, oddly, in the early 80s. 
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world. 
This is from Lahaina, and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history. 
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website. 
I am very concerned about this because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run. 
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. 
And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to. 
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate. 
And that's already happening. 
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful. 
They seem to come from the outside, and to mimic perception. 
Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. 
So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive. 
One of those dark spots is Madagascar, a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. 
(Laughter) The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. 
By the way, the aphid tries to escape. 
The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits. 
We banned those chemicals, and we replaced them, unknowingly, with other substances that, molecule per molecule, are a hundred times more potent as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. 
The artisanal movement is huge. 
RB: Philippe is quite erratic, so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no. 
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition, and lying on my mum's sofa, day in day out, watching daytime TV. 
We were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution. 
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. 
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this," and you can go out and fold it. 
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do. 
Now grid cells are found, again, on the inputs to the hippocampus, and they're a bit like place cells. 
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day, and I was sent to jail. 
But it's also law. And of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us. 
A 10-year-old. 
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating, and that's mind-wandering. 
And we found some remarkable differences. 
That is great, that means we're going to have 10 billion minds working together, 10 billion talents together. 
This is the only equation in the talk by the way. 
You get to see the beam the way it's projected and bent. 
And I say to you, I might not stick to this, but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo. 
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?" 
Hundreds of people were paralyzed. 
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies? 
Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. 
The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent. 
We rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe. 
We do not use any electrons that come from coal. 
And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. 
As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion. 
♫ A dream within a dream, ♫ ♫ a world within a world, ♫ ♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫ ♫ travels out across the land. ♫ ♫ Images flickering, ♫ ♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫ ♫ a procession of limousines ♫ ♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫ ♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫ ♫ Reaching out from within ♫ ♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Annihilation moves. ♫ ♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫ ♫ The sound of the final boom ♫ ♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫ 
Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it. 
And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. 
If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. 
But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive, they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds. 
And this records every single step I've taken for, ooh, five or six years now.

I salute you. 
Ten years from now we will have the same story, and we will be repeating the same things. 
There were pigeons roosting in the dish. 
Here at TED there are great opportunities. 
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy, and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings. 
And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing. 
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.

Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before. 
Wow. Wow. (Applause) Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that. 
So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster. 
And it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art, which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all, or for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme of "Inspired by Nature" -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him, but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die, but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says, "Because it's my nature" -- 
External actors can only present to you an opportunity. 
And what is happening with this is some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI, as being an expert, Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do, and that's what they're trying to do. 
Chef: No, but that's all it is. 
But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done, and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.

There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina; all those states that were clear, it's legal. 
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test. 
They know they can control their world. 
And in this folder, "Creative Projects," there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on, projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day, and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. 
If you think that, you've forgotten high school. 
Some may have considered me foolhardy, but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists. 
And there's the sheep. 
That's why we look different. 
And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all, many people around the world have been wondering, how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football, run around in this desert climate? How would it be possible that spectators sit, enjoy themselves in open-air stadia in this hot environment? 
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is, that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power, then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. 
They seem very, very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. 
It's the refrigerators. 
Now if we go to the area, lots is worse than nuclear or wind. 
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps. 
Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. 
He looks pretty good at this stage. 
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page. 
And third, they're all attracted to each other, but they try to keep a small distance apart. 
So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees. 
It's unbelievable. 
I want to do so because, in my view, the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question. 
So this is the inevitability about it. 
So this is what they were going to do in their trial. 
In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment. 
We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. 
And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.

They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store. 
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. 
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. 
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. 
(Clapping) (Applause) So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends. 
We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play. 
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland. 
Stay tuned for that.

This is information copied with variation and selection. 
Maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized, and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us, the next generation, so much so that when I was growing up, if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime — a mugging, a murder, a burglary — we winced along with our parents, because they were letting the side down. 
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that. 
The second thing is, what about the know-how? 
It is simple and complex. 
Now, you know, if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money.

And the proof is not in a computer model. 
These human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed? 
You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily. 
That is a wonderful idea. 
It's that simple. 
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said, can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer?

What that means, of course, is that, in the past, things were closer together. 
Unfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one, because it made him bankrupt, and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money. 
And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.

But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. 
You are going to take the photos. 
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.

Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know, but I would say that the most surprising slide here I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one. 
And it prevents them from forming those chains, those mitotic spindles, that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells. 
So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. 
Here's my brain. 
The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible. 
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Disney. 
What's the idea behind it? 
How about the visual system? 
We only had money for women to train them, to send them to school, and nothing else. 
Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy. 
So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. 
Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may. 
♫ The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one ♫ ♫ How I prayed for this day to come ♫ ♫ And I pray that the world find wisdom ♫ ♫ To give the poor in need some assistance ♫ ♫ Instead of putting up resistance, yeah ♫ ♫ Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this ♫ ♫ It ain't gonna happen ♫ ♫ They're all sitting on they asses ♫ ♫ Popping champagne and sponging off the masses ♫ ♫ Coming from a refugee boy-soldier ♫ ♫ But I still got my dignity ♫

"One does not put sugar in green tea." 
I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. 
These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. 
And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion, how much stronger the illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness, and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects, see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things. 
If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. 
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago.

It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC. 
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.

And that idea stuck in my head. 
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. 
All I'm asking is for forgiveness. 
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there. 
And I said, well, in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. 
you might be able to look at brain activity and say, "This person's going to be a good poker player," or, "This person's socially naive," and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. 
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming. 
What is raw? The raw, I would say is the naked experience, untouched by luxury, untouched by expensive materials, untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. 
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. 
And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds -- protons, that act as the glue between the two strands. 
(Laughter) The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua, it's about 3,000 miles, and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done. 
We were driving along this dark, dark road, and the guy in the green stepped out, and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."

And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her. 
And given the life of many of these chemicals, generations, years, dozens of years, that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today. 
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering. 
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system, then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history. 
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities. 
And it's hard for a couple of reasons. 
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place, but that's really not the case anymore. 
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell. 
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover, which is, again, mostly the plastics. 
I heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.

And what I'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true: that for children two years old and up, there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats, in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why -- what is it that makes that true? 
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. 
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities I've developed a device that, on a very small scale, can produce these isotopes. 
There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles. 
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next? 
Thank you. 
So for example the first text: there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign. 
With the service economy, it is about improving quality. 
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. 
So you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players, and in the center there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. 
So, we create silence as much as we create sound. 
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne. 
(Laughter) The original building, because it was frog-like, fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. 
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free. 
This one is more than 400 years old. 
Everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.

Now it's just five times, and soon it will be 2.5 times. 
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity. 
So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes, I show people what those outcomes will get you, in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500, 2,000 dollars per month and so on. 
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults. 
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A. 
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history, and you're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders. 
Right? You have to have economic structure.

It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease. 
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. 
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie. 
For animals that don't surface, we have something called pop-up tags, which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. 
So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task, like a surgical subtask, at 10 times the speed of a human. 
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest in their 52 choices, and they never heard about what is a money market fund. 
They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.

A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as -- you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake, right, because you can see behind the facade, right? 
(Laughter) But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. 
I was very influenced by that anecdote. 
Look for it. Have you noticed it? 
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. 
Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us, and she's clearly projecting, you know, love and admiration at him. 
that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. 
In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation in energy efficiency solutions. 
However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer. 
There are guys competing with each other. 
So can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems -- say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say, "That has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons, and this is how we might simplify it"? 
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software -- I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.

In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. 
And in one of our labs, Jack Szostak's labs, it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments -- which are very common on planets, on certain types of planets like the Earth, where you have some liquid water and some clays -- you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. 
Nor may time be bought or sold. 
The people who produce these phones, and some of which I'm sure are in the room right now, could potentially look at doing what we call closed-loop systems, or product system services, so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand's not going to go anywhere, so you design the product to solve the problem. 
Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom -- "Oh, I'm dead" -- peripetia. 
(Laughter) Somewhat like the curving of the universe. 
Because that is what Knopf is. 
The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin when they asked him, "What do you think increases with knowledge?" 
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height? 
Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. 
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin, and you can borrow it." 
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference, and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. 
And as you're thinking about this, you might also ask the question: So why a single human species? 
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments. 
When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain -- how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians, how music, and listening to music, could just light up the entire brain, from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum, how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism, to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression, how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music, 
Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. 
And one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic enhancement modules that they got 25 years earlier from their parents? 
And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony, you never see them deep down. 
So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again. 
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration -- and some other therapies, and put us in a corner. 
or any date for that fact, it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you." 
I think what's so brilliant about the festivals, the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today. 
Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails. 
The first is that by definition, this money printed would be spent overseas. 
But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. 
LD: There was just one problem. 
But these three questions, I can answer them. 
That's an enormous amount of cars. 
Well, this is what deep time does to a building. 
And you're telling him what we're talking about, about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music. 
Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. 
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area? 
What is real is separateness, and at some point in early babyhood, the idea of self starts to form. 
But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones, so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be. 
And I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this. 
In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences, and there was a very healthy sense of caution, reflected in the Tree of Knowledge, in Pandora's Box, and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology. 
It's important that we build this platform, that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying, "Look, we must do something different." 
And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. 
They have a tremendous passion to learn. 
So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so. 
"Here is love, all of it." 
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water. 
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. 
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. 
At 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not. 
And this is perhaps the most important facet: we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business. 
He knows one world, and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world, both of which he has deep connections to. 
"Those who left are worse off now. 
Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me, and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. 
MIT just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips. 
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. 
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic. 
So this is not using any suction, any glue, and it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot -- it's as biologically inspired as the animal -- hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface. 
This is the Great Reconvergence, and it's the biggest story of your lifetime. 
So, let me ask you this -- I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question -- who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B? 
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot -- God help her. 
But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. 
But it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing. 
She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. 
(Laughter) Or Florida: "Police Taser six year-old boy at elementary school." 
And yet, there is this disconnect. 
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals: shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab, clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold. 
And as we get farther away, the sound gets fainter and fainter. 
These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. 
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be. 
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. 
She's just laid it down nice and tidy. 
That's what happens. 
And the answer to that question is, it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question. 
And the market research, consumer research, asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like, what they would like to live in, tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we're already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. 
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 
DH: I do, I do. 
Grasslands created opportunities. 
In the United States alone, 100,000 men, women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs, and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. 
I have to tell you a little bit about my family. 
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night, and there were definitely some heads turning, you know, people smoking and, "Huh!" 
I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done. 
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog. 
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism, but then after independence, all of a sudden, markets, capitalism became a western institution, and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism. 
The winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is. 
Compassion is not defined in one form. 
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness. 
It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. 
There was a UN official who visited last year, and he said, "They ate all the grass so there was no grass left." 
I still valued self-worth above all other worth, and what was there to suggest otherwise? 
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic, we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience? 
When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said, "I think therefore I am," -- we mean the head. 
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing. 
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses, actually the very game I showed you at the beginning, those action-packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. 
The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫ ♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫ That's compassion. (Applause) Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision 
What is its price? 20,000 dollars. 
It baffles the mind. And so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians. (Laughter) So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer, and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred, and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it, but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth 
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images. 
(Laughter) Beneath it is a wonderful knife. 
So, what we did for the first two and a half years was four things: We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields, like cognitive psychology, spatial cognition, gender studies, play theory, sociology, primatology. 
And this is what every student has to begin with. 
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house to film her painting. 
This -- you can put details, toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. 
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town, Bangalore. 
I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations? 
I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine. 
But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. 
Somebody get the front legs. 
(Laughter) HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this. 
But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. 
If you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates, we think we're going to eat bananas next week. 
And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. 
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial, which from top to bottom shows a Serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an Orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them. 
And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives, but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence? 
It's a compound curve interior. 
Little wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide, and that something, of course, need not be illegal. 
(Laughter) CA: What's on your mind? 
And with the labor pain, I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me. 
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?" 
So, you start with something in the computer. 
The elders are the libraries. 
So, when you saw my footage, you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs, and shot in smoke. 
Because you have one and you don't have one, I'll give you a tenth of a second head start. 
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. 
We're reading the book of life. 
But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society. 
What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons? 
Let me give you another example. 
(Applause) Because this is the most distressing TED ever, I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag. 
It's old-school demographics. 
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. 
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. 
We can choose to change our environment to have more bees. 
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real, but how do you get over that? 
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit. 
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing -- the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise. 
Now, it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. 
(Applause) On a more personal note, this betrayal of our principles, our decency, our hope, made it impossible for me to avoid the question, "What will I say, years from now, when people ask, 'Where were you?'" As president of a leading liberal arts college, famous for its innovative history, there were no excuses. 
Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women. 
So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. 
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration. 
So, what do we need to know in order to predict? 
This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years, and I have one here tonight. 
Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry, now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous. 
And how would one deepen such a faith? 
So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that in fact, much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. 
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. 
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. 
(Laughter) And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself." 
And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. 
His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything. 
And I think I was 14. 
This is a serious business. 
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there and the intervention? 
Think about this for a second. 
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. 
So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. 
Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation? 
We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid, if you look at it. 
Because it's so hard to admit our own fallibility. 
The cloud lifted, the wind was still, and even the bear showed up. 
What does that mean? 
And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. 
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations, they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible. 
This one, I would say, was a serious challenge. 
Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home. 
I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly. 
This innovation is from the slums of Rio. 
You think, "Bend elbow," a different section contracts. 
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here." 
So why would I worry? 
Now, this is the very interesting part. 
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping, and then moving on, I'm fine. 
Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet. 
And they would say, "Well, what about you? 
How are they doing this? They're doing it in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work, by IMing from their office to their friends, by texting under the desk. 
And so on. So I suddenly figured that, how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children? 
(Applause) Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues. 
So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. 
So it's not just something you do in your spare time. 
Hold that compliment very, very tightly. Hold it for later. 
Well, some really nice little tricks. 
I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here -- this axis here is child mortality -- and here I have the family size. 
So the reading would be over very quickly. 
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on. 
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you. 
How? 
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. 
There's a group of scientists in Cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree, because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree." 
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord. 
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. 
But you know. 
So where does it take us? 
What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds, and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms; and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy, and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together. 
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance. 
So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes, dengue will follow. 
And I walked down the middle, up to the train station, and everything below 14th Street was closed. 
They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist, because I had expertise in eyewitness memory identification, which obviously makes sense for this case, right? 
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society, especially an open democratic society, it's only when ideas take root that things change. 
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras. 
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience, are now used to this change. 
I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan, in the presence of continuous noise. 
Well with our technology, the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer. 
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then, even as I delivered it, and which I understand better now is this: I will always, always, always be there. 
And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating. 
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. 
Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective -- we talked a lot about innovation today -- the science of innovation, how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative. 
There's just silence and a cool temperature. 
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. 
(Laughter) KA: What does it mean? 
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. 
But this is going to be an introduction, and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. 
It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of, and a story that is certainly ongoing. 
But technology alone isn't enough. 
Didn't make sense to me. 
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED. 
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be. 
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky. 
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil, and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities. 
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. 
The more stuff that's mine, the better. 
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string. 
Let's move to health. 
Abed and I sat with our coffee. 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. 
But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world, I hope you take some of this stuff away with you, and when you have an opportunity to be influential, that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas. 
My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition. 
And technology has even changed our relationship to God. 
And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself, I was so inspired by that story. 
Sure. It's the computer. 
I'm Robbie Mizzone. I'm 13, and I play the fiddle. 
The stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing. 
And the government, they heard her story and the other people, and they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law. 
And you'll see, there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red. 
Somebody who comes from the United States. 
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. 
This actually became my creative obsession. 
"Pick-up" is to pick someone up, but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks. 
Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!" 
We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam? 
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built. 
Uh huh. 
And as these technologies go forward, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things -- 2000, human genome sequence -- and it seems like nothing's happening, until it does. 
They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy. 
(Applause) We'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security. 
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great. 
That's really bad. Why is it so bad? 
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China, of course, though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth. 
That's actually my son, right here. 
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. 
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. 
What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here -- the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy, not for a democracy. 
(Laughter) But guys, if history has taught us anything, it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually. 
It was performed last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn, which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world, built in 1844. 
But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. 
I’d studied environment at this formal level, but there was this informal level. 
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem. 
You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater, not a good thing to happen underwater. 
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration, and you're going to notice a pulsing. 
Thank you for that. 
These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. 
And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now. 
This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. 
And if it meant that we would now return to 30 years of silence, my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so." 
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. 
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally." 
they would say, "I've got six friends. 
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things, and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. 
But that's a ton of power. 
But I couldn't do anything else. 
Again, we start by designing the human into the process. 
It's actually about using dynamics, using forces, to influence the behavior of where you are, what you do there, how you do it. 
That's it. Please save this. 
And we came together and formed a project called MANTRA. 
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening." 
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build. 
And I suggest that they have two options. 
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs, and all of the things that interact among those, the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it, so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is. 
They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. 
By 2007, the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. 
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client, and turned and he said to me, 'I know it's going to cost less, I know it's going to sell more, but we're not pioneers, because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'" I think we've got a roomful of pioneers, and I hope there are far more pioneers out there, because we need to solve these problems. 
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer. 
And it looks delicious. 
We go to the laboratory. 
It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. 
I do take certain liberties and intervene. 
It might just save their lives. 
So there is a huge gap to bridge. 
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?" 
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it. 
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother. 
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there. 
"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it." 
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew, etc. 
This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen. 
We can start harvesting condensation, and start greening the desert from within. 
The material is actually being coated with the cells. 
It's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong. 
When we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh, what we produced was, we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide. 
When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, "You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese." 
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs, and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. 
And this student, probably the first time using it, but she can articulate it many different ways. 
And when they're missing, it's a barrier. 
Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer, and the problem is, as we age, our organs tend to fail more, and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. 
Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. 
And if we do this often enough, and we do it respectfully, people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. 
This is called Botanicalls, because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module in the plant, and it's measuring the well-being of the plant, and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter) So, you know, this plant will start to say, "This is really hot," or there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter) So it just gives a personality to your plant. 
In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure. 
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen. 
And that one big disadvantage is that, until you actually do all that learning, you're going to be helpless. 
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals." 
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter, and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this. 
We finally gave up, took it out of the code. 
I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives. 
As a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems. 
So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree? 
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot. 
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work. 
And here's the future. 
So, this is a frequent theme: societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. 
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one of a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual. 
And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses. 
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running." 
And so naturally, I started to distance myself. 
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts. 
And that was torture, real torture. 
I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change, and I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in, and you can trade it across all these social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. 
You can derive many ideas from that. 
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. 
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. 
In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. 
(Applause) MK: That to say, when you look at the picture behind us, to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. 
Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. 
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar." 
And therefore Time took notice of this 28-dollar foot, basically. 
Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend? Sure. 
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. 
It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do. 
And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right. 
One, don't say you're authentic unless you really are authentic. 
Initially, it does some random motion, and then it tries to figure out what it might look like. 
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. 
And it doesn't mean don't study music. 
And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity, my mother told me of the miracle I was, said I could grow up to be anything I want. 
Check out this one I found. 
They wanted us to be analytical. 
Wow. Wow. 
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. 
It was like watching a graduation ceremony. 
And in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious, controversial and ultimately, for me, life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other. 
And my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?" 
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy. 
Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa, came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East. 
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun. 
It has two redundant oxygen tanks. 
This is one of my first book works. 
On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer. 
So I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973, to the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat. 
This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding, so males choose the lucky rabbit. 
They flip the negative. 
There's another reason as well. 
As you can see here on this graph, in blue, these are all other mammals, but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really, really high metabolic rate, and the question is, how can they do that? 
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture. 
You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet. 
So this already, I think, is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. 
It's what I study. It's what I treat. 
This is a parasitic wasp, again, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier. 
And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. 
So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite, which also happens to be a minimal energy surface. 
(Laughter) And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?" 
So, we had to do that gamble. 
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary, because I want to talk to you later. 
We have agency. 
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air, a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide -- all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. 
Here's an early computer. 
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab. 
So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules would spread in the air, and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance. 
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam. 
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. 
(Laughter) The idea is that basically -- if it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?" 
Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand. 
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities, like softness, breathability, durability, elasticity and even things like pattern. 
Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease, this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame, because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump, show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show, so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking, "I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township." 
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. 
I was excited. 
One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem to go find a man I'd never met but who had changed my life. 
Well we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago. 
And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up. 
Thank you. 
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. 
What does that mean? 
Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. 
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge advocate of the Web. 
(Laughter) And we all know that is the Hulk. 
She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it. 
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink, in my opinion. 
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. 
On my last day in December of 2011, the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced, their world shattered. 
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. 
In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. 
No, we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground. 
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. 
I start, and this is where a child says to me -- and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my laconic child. 
So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator, and we had eight startups sitting around there. 
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. 
These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards, other kinds of cooperative infrastructure, and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice. 
How do you put simple disruptive technologies, and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk? 
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. 
There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence. 
It was approaching 11 when I exited right toward Afula, and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara. 
From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species. 
We call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else. 
What's the formula? 
Their behavior is predictable. 
I've been a street police officer, an undercover investigator, a counter-terrorism strategist, and I've worked in more than 70 countries around the world. 
But also, the sense of smell. 
Do something different. What do you want to be? 
So first of all, give me your poker face. Yep, awesome. (Laughter) And then as she smiles, this is a genuine smile, it's great. 
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received, I was able to deliver two. 
Thank you. 
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota. 
Thank you very much. 
Anybody drink one of these here this week? 
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right. 
A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. 
OK, so here is the sort of big idea: If you look out at nature, you find that as you tend to see suspended animation, you tend to see immortality. 
The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents. 
There is another spike visible at 22. 
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves. 
So this project also, because of its involved practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is, if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice. 
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. 
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. 
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims. 
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest. 
For many decades, biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. 
But how could the crowd become synchronized? 
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern, and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment. 
Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth. 
Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. 
Let me give you just one example of this. 
Since 1989, the country has performed at a double-digit rate every year for the last 20 years. 
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist, as well as the words anode, cathode and ion, but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides. 
It's not just my work in amphibians, but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe, holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats, an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well. 
Great leaders want exactly the same thing. 
Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here. 
So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one -- zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain. 
Obviously, you've got a computer now. 
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level, beneath its weight. 
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital. 
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. 
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. 
It's sort of cloudy water. 
It's a trap to me, of course. 
In the book, I go over controversies such as this one, and a number of other hot buttons, hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on -- including the arts, cloning, crime, free will, education, evolution, gender differences, God, homosexuality, infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality, Nazism, parenting, politics, race, rape, religion, resource depletion, social engineering, technological risk and war. 
So here's what you do. 
But again, the question is, here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest, the natural enemy. 
When things were bad, we had porridge. 
It was then that her eyes lit up. 
And then we asked them again, "How likely are you to suffer from cancer?" 
It's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus. 
It is made out of silicon. 
(Laughter) So, the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me, but I'm certainly going to try. 
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. 
For me, it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context. 
Because to make any kind of progress, we need to be able to imagine a different reality, and then we need to believe that that reality is possible. 
In hyena societies, adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. 
And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called "Design and the Elastic Mind." 
This is not a question between privacy against security. 
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it? 
Six months later, she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia. 
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. 
And we aren't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today. 
He thought I was some kind of magician. 
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play. 
(Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future? 
Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper? 
At least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like Mahmoud." 
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter) Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter) It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause) It just changes the same content. 
But I rather play something completely unheard of, and even with flaws, than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. 
This was now, I think, February, early February. 
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo. 
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away? 
Put that aside. 
And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future. 
Right now, they are under the skin, but in the future, they won't have to be implanted. 
Woman 2: They suck? What about yours? 
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life. 
These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. 
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss. 
Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways -- some of those could be repositioned or repurposed, or whatever word you want to use, for new applications, basically teaching old drugs new tricks. 
And it's a pretty big building. 
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors. 
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. 
There is jeopardy, and of course, the closer you get, it gets harder. 
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here, and I was here, and my guys. 
And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. 
All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake? 
Then you toss the coin. 
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. 
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world, because they are kind of show offs. 
Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters, or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. 
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple, or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like, what it smells like." 
The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. 
And so I forgot to tell you the scale. 
Now ideas have this amazing property. 
This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location, then move to a new location. 
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
After the intervention, no more discrimination: the same amount of stickers to their best friend and the least favorite child. 
And the store, strangely, people came to them and bought things, and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center, which was behind it, but to me, more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do, kids would come and get instruction in writing, and when you have to walk this weird, liminal, fictional space like this to go do your writing, it's going to affect the kind of work that you make. 
Tarka took this photo of me one evening after I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia. 
Now these are my comrades in arms. 
Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction, protected as well. 
We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. 
Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me, it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere. 
They were able to create something wonderful. 
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda, to maximize efficient mobility, providing more room for buses, more room for bikes, more room for people to enjoy the city, and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. 
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. 
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads. 
So, 125 degrees is normal. 
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. 
But in a modern and complex world, you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face. 
The water's stiff. 
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there. 
AE: So now I'm down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there. 
There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell, and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus, that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. 
And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. 
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?" 
And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower, broader, backing in, backing out -- you're not searching, you're not browsing. 
But what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion? 
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV? 
Every parent I know, myself included, feels like we're constantly playing defense. 
What color are the bears at the North Pole?" 
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure. 
This is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives. 
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm, and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed. 
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. 
That's a Boeing 707. 
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. 
Like generations before us, we'll be growing up in war -- not a war between civilizations, but a war for civilization, for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age. 
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers, parents, performers -- to be explorers together. 
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. 
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things. 
And that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking, which makes sense, because their nerves are dying. 
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper, so there was some evidence left. 
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil." 
Because since pre-partition, they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground. 
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison, but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right? 
After exploring the underground of Paris, I decided to climb up, and I climbed a Gothic monument that's right in the middle of Paris. 
They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic: the Santee Alley demographic. 
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel. 
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff. 
(Applause) Until then, until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. 
Also, genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. 
(Laughter) But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists. 
And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian. 
The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. 
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects, earthworms, fungi -- but in general, on land, it's really rare. 
I'll just say, July. 
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption, design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation -- the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful, productive and profitable. 
These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. 
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so. 
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it. 
But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability. 
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church. 
Why do they do this? 
So here, all the cards are face down -- you agree? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Yes? You see that in the screen? 
And particularly in cities -- we could look at the whole metabolism of cities, and look at those as opportunities. 
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. 
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities. 
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, playing Shakespeare's Richard III. 
Because ultimately, our humanity depends on everyone's humanity. 
Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious. 
And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough. 
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere. 
RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels: reason. 
But how do they pick up those celestial cues? 
Well now, I die. 
We had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done, and we dicked around for six months. 
(Applause) I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant. 
(Laughter) And so the kids are raised in a certain way, jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure -- SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice. 
Only about 250. 
Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements, and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip from a piece called "Echolalia." 
I led trade delegations here to the United States, to Japan, to India, to encourage investment, to help to create jobs, to build up our economy, to build up our health system, our education -- our development. 
Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and, indeed, even from further away, in California. 
The cleaner came into the synagogue. 
In the 1930s, Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles. 
Now the first step, pretty easy. 
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that. 
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. 
Then -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth. 
(Laughter) I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. 
There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women. 
And why on earth could that be so? 
So we need a new fire. 
And here's her poem. 
Go get it, girl. 
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. 
Well we've seen good results so far. 
Let me say that again. 
There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system. 
I rarely actually quote anything, so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can, [in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006. 
And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life. 
Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average. 
(Applause) And now I want to talk about something entirely different. 
That causes a huge drop in the value. 
This team of women, in many ways, was like women everywhere. 
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells? 
And he wrote this: "Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. 
The landscape is incredible. 
He was one of the members. The question was: How do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins? 
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. 
Probably a form of synesthesia. 
Man, her office was packed. 
But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture. 
FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs. 
I could do it again to show it one more time, but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it. 
On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution: "The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party." 
That's the good news. 
And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions. 
But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. 
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we live at one of those times. 
And according to the Higgs theory, at that instant, a dramatic event took place in the universe. 
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth? 
(Applause) I am a conductor, and I'm here today to talk to you about trust. 
I can put it in place where it's meant to be. 
And I've summarized those things, for me personally, as three As. 
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it. 
In the northern part of New Zealand, I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer, and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon. 
It has to be safe. 
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism, the way my uncle likes it. 
As a result, we both became increasingly hypoglycemic — we had low blood sugar levels day after day — and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold. 
As they handle the ice, in fact, they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven, so that, when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen, they can don a fresh pair. 
And I remember the first letter. 
There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset, a totally different society. 
We have an incredible gift in the boreal, an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming, but we could let that slip away. 
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood. 
Gorgeous assistant instructor. 
Because it really matters who speaks life. 
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. 
Now I've been Googling -- I've been online since 1989 on CompuServe. 
This one doesn't have the video in it, but you get a little feel from what it can do. 
And best of all, I saw the animals. 
CA: (Laughter) Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented? 
But today, finally, after economic reforms, and economic growth, I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth, cities are engines of creativity, cities are engines of innovation, have finally been accepted. 
Paper maps are becoming obsolete. 
But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas, to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance. 
But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them. 
I went through about 16 surgeries, and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was 10. 
There are four countries around the board. 
And it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland of North America. 
And to tell you the truth, I never really bought into this argument, in part because I never saw three American presidents agree on anything else in the past. 
And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. 
And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world. 
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. 
And the answer is yes. 
You can contrast them by thinking about Universal City Walk versus Disney World, or Disneyland. 
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. 
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done. 
I stayed there for three years. 
So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. 
In this, I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda, which is what these maps demonstrate. 
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955. 
So as more and more of our lives become digital, we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions. 
Poor nutrition, access to water, climate change, deforestation, lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food, not enough healthcare, pollution. 
No water, no corrosion. 
They get in the Gulf Stream. They go all the way to Europe. 
We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. 
And you see IDEO there. 
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump -- and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. 
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. 
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients. 
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. 
And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions, the gel we put. 
Bad system of survival. 
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman, standing up to men with guns who want to kill us? 
It was really quite astonishing. 
But we had to do it. 
And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once-thriving business that's surprised by a market shift, finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business. 
So I was walking around it. 
So, naturally, they chased him out of town. 
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean, so here we go. 
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus, and we find cells here with viral particles in them. 
And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch. 
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops, and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother. 
(Applause) Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin. 
Cost-benefit analysis. 
And once you make these, you make a little house. 
He's a great white shark. 
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature, which belongs to osmium. 
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. 
It's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature. 
This is the control room inside of the ship. 
Many of these deaths were completely preventable, and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing, what I want to call "the last mile" problem. 
E: Woo. 
Now, cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. 
Or, more importantly, HIV, where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes. 
BMW is a pretty safe car. 
And after a pause, they said, "They had been tortured." 
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder. 
And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects. 
We know that. 
They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure. 
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement, growing plants, going around, around, around, trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. 
A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty. 
At 20 the torch of resentment was lit. 
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. 
You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air, going at hundreds of miles an hour, and you're trying to drop an object, a bomb, towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments. 
Now look, naturally there's a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week, but the truth is it didn't really bother us. 
To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently? 
But actually, a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. 
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined: "schizophonia." 
You’re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?" 
Isn't that awesome? 
The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter) I swear to God. 
The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character. It was so cool. 
Why? Because they are just like the CIA. 
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading. 
And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. 
And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician turned physicist. And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and, eventually, a million spots along it. 
It was great to have you here. 
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us, the head of Aljazeera.net, he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. 
After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. 
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose, father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy. 
Now I'm a middle-aged guy. 
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist. 
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs. 
They suck up all the water, keep to themselves, and they drip feed the lower city. 
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different, and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world, but if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas. 
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries. 
And under conditions where it really matters, older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information. 
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually. 
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards. 
We are not a special interest group. 
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes. 
I know those hands and eyes; they touched me as well. 
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective. 
Well, I guess. You know, China has no — (Laughter) — no intellectual property, right? 
(Applause) My passions are music, technology and making things. 
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little, and 100 people who did not take antibiotics. 
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away, lost in their own reverie. 
Now, you might say, beetles, sure, they're very simple creatures, but surely not mammals. 
The war in Vietnam was raging; the Civil Rights Movement was under way; and pictures had a powerful influence on me. 
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. 
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. 
I had a sleeping bag. 
But painting for a long time had a fractal side. 
The United States is the only superpower, and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. 
Whether you think about immediate gratification, and the chocolates versus bananas, it's just painful to save now. 
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. 
Just a quick idea of the measurements. 
And this is the terrain it appears over, and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. 
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion. 
They just aren't, it's a bad deal. 
Now, these are two things that you probably may have heard of, but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about. 
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes. 
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. 
When I realized this, and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars, and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there, weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council, I thought, this is wrong. 
Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, "Well actually, this is hard to grasp," because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. 
And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun, the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually, this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away, because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background. 
Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. 
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry, what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family? 
Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. 
This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses, mainly from burning fossil fuels. 
They ran around corners, they went up sides of buildings, and they melded into the architecture. 
(Laughter) Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life. 
And then we went to teachers. 
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations, doing very important work. 
It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much, and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience, still found it in himself to try to protect me. 
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. 
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money, you can only measure progress by spending money -- you're going to have a pretty miserable time. 
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it. 
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know. 
Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions, "Know thyself?" 
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti. 
It was a photograph, not of space-time, but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there. 
So this is little Emma. 
So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting. 
My first book was called "Mass Customization" -- it came up a couple of times yesterday -- and how I discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service, because it was done just for a particular person, because it wasn't inventoried, it was delivered on demand to that individual person. 
It's called an allele. 
I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality, I still crave more. 
And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago, "Give me my damn data, because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean." 
And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself. 
You don't even have to be Jewish. 
We spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make. 
Sohio is on the axis here, and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts. 
Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how -- I can’t see out of these, OK. 
You see, that's the immune system. 
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. 
So after the walk people ask me, "How can you top that?" 
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!" 
Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees. 
Wooo! 
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident." 
Does Amazon carry it? 
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries. 
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his foie gras. 
And then we reverse the current. 
Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. 
Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated. 
This is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology. 
And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about, and that we're familiar with, for the textile industry, the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things. 
And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger. 
We are social beings from the beginning. 
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee, and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test. 
(Laughter) Every important machine's got to have a big red button. 
And if I meet somebody on an airplane -- this happened on the way over to Scotland -- if I meet somebody on an airplane, and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?" 
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way? 
And I work in design. 
Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time. 
And what really struck me about them was that they weren't only optimistic, but they kind of struck me as nervous, for lack of a better word. 
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says, "And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore. 
Now, both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy, and that enemy is laughter, because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly, and you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging, and that's just squeezing the air out of you. 
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. 
But what were they accused of? 
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city. 
It's the same plot. 
But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point. 
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids, but there is no life. 
I think most people don't want to be dead, but I do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds. 
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions. 
I got some photographs from them. 
And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. 
Didn't have to worry about earning money. 
He's an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna. 
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. 
You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen, is the network. 
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? 
This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean. 
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed, and said, "Are you going to compete?" No. 
I need some information, and I need a container. 
Your life will have new meaning. 
This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. 
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C. 
When I wrote my report to the Koreans, I said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing," but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend. 
First of all, the news was so heavy. 
This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the satellite was flying over Argentina. 
Next, let's look at solar power. 
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. 
So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly, so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder. 
In India now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet. 
There's nothing new here. 
So he thought, why don't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine? 
The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly. 
with no employees. 
The great thing is, when you cut something in half, you have another half. 
It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. 
in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs. 
His father was an SOB, and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood, but then we were off and running. 
From a greenhouse gas perspective, is lamb produced in the U.K. 
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. 
Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. 
In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds, which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like. 
I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. 
But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs? 
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?" 
Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. 
Now I think this is a solvable problem. 
The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. 
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield? 
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant? 
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. 
So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. 
So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies? 
Now, the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University, the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard, and wrote the word "Apple" underneath, and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up." 
Please name any card, anyone. 
And we've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere. 
So now I want to take you to the moment of -- When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company, there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand, and then the service launches. What happens? 
What can damage accumulate in? 
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office -- (Laughter) which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. 
Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking, road trips, airports. 
(Laughter) You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. 
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories, so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work. 
The second thing I'd like to talk about: If you were living in a remote village somewhere, your child was limp, and you were in a drought, or you were in floods, or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet, what would you do? 
And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind, that is more truthful than your universe. 
And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful. 
It's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet, throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe, and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick, and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous. 
(Laughter) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous. 
When people are given the opportunity to create in the world, there's really two things they want. 
We've had the Internet in its public form for almost 20 years now, and it's still changing as the media becomes more social. 
We can abstract them and to create something that is new. 
But there is a glamour of industry. 
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you." 
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner. 
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear, getting anything done in a four-month period of time? 
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free. 
There's a lot going on there. 
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world. 
Huh? 
When you think about that, let me go back to what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity, "Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 -- points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon, if you will. 
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. 
And this explanation represents great progress. 
This is a long, slow process -- One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation. 
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see. 
I became very interested, and I wrote about a couple. 
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. 
And so, to give an example, this is a project from last year, which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor. 
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. 
Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. 
RNA provides the information for protein. 
But watch what happens here. 
And if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert. 
I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants. 
Our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate, and here we see poor Prometheus, who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the Greek gods. 
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds, he planted it on his 30 acres, all around. 
One of them was this grandmother. 
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?" 
And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you, some of our heroes right now. 
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole. 
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development, and the reef is on a full-bore recovery. 
And we have it in something called an aeroshell. 
You take a six to eight cell embryo, you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell, and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it. 
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi. 
Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. 
And the answer is, of course, yes. 
If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. 
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. 
Tamara, would you like to jump in? 
If we were to remain sexist, and that was not right, but if we were going to go forward and be sexist, it's actually a woman's disease. 
(Laughter) Myself included. 
And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut, they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. 
And this is where I have to query all of you. 
So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. 
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?" 
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it. 
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack. 
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation. 
So this is something you have to recognize. 
And so women started earning more, they started contributing more financially to the house, and men had to think again before saying no to them when they were coming to the centers. 
Everything that's happening with Second Life and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s. 
She didn't expect me to go there. 
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal -- it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. 
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? 
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain, to the part of my brain that controls my hand. 
And the first story is called "The Faulty Switch." 
It has a melody. 
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble, but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. 
It's actually not life, it's a crystal. 
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. 
So you can see that it's pretty limited, and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code, they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there, but it's not so clear what that something is, and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning, that with the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image? It was a baby's face. 
So we look at the bone histology. 
And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995. 
So this whole project was an experiment. 
We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger. 
It's a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. 
The way that you look at this data is, first, look around the outside of the circle. 
Just exploit it; just build things." 
This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL. 
We are programmed for something called procreative success. 
It gives you a sense of the trend. 
We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. 
The phrase 'Art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion. 
This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway and then he traveled to the island of Utøya and shot and killed a group of kids. 
Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many. 
You know the funny thing is, I get my hands drier than people do with three or four, because they can't get in between the cracks. 
I moved back to Kenya in 2011. 
And we gave it a shot. 
Now for many of you, this story might seem trivial or naive. 
So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see -- facial features, skin color, hair structure -- are not determined by single genes with big effects, but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world. 
We need to stay away from the moratoriums. 
And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. 
Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living in institutions, and more entering every day. 
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. 
(Laughter) And you'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate. 
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation, that education has a payoff. 
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. 
We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it. 
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness, and whereas almost all the rest of them, regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever -- are almost equally happy on average? 
(Laughter) Is that a good way to play ping-pong? 
They say, well, we have a thing in a box, and we have its inputs and its outputs. 
(Laughter) So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information. 
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean, and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela. 
You can paint a hive to match your home. 
Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood? 
(Laughter) So I learned to write about myself in third person at a young age. 
They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna -- as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days. 
I think we're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason: The facts are getting out there. 
They would say wolves. 
And let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab. 
I've planted a hundred trees in a day. 
It's about 400 million years old. 
But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save. 
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the human population -- it's something we should be aware of. 
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway. 
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people. 
Islam actually, as a monotheistic religion, which defined man as a responsible agent by itself, created the idea of the individual in the Middle East and saved it from the communitarianism, the collectivism of the tribe. 
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said. 
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch, came to the United States one thousand years ago. 
So be decisive on these issues. 
What happens with that? 
That's a hopeful message, but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. 
It could be a family-size pizza; it could be a very individual-size pizza, right? 
Given a couple of clues, I could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out. 
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. 
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want. 
And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. 
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable. 
JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here. 
We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems. 
I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings, but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings, like, but I think — " and you're just like, "Oh my God. 
And so, I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries, which is the main reason for the misery, for the poverty, for the conflicts, for the violence, for the desperation in many of these countries. 
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes. 
It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you. 
I said, "I can't, Mr. President. 
Are you ready? Okay. 
But actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left, maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible. 
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic. 
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape. 
(Applause) Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. 
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling, and how they structure teacher pay. 
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing, until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. 
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city. 
Now, contrary to what many people believe, terrorism is actually a very expensive business. 
I had to meet my Prime Minister. 
Hi there. 
There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs. 
That's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park. 
By the way, they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand, and a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer, which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures. 
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. 
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms -- the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.

RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. 
We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain. 
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it: "progress." 
I put this problem on my blog recently: In a grocery store, which line do you get into, the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items. 
First, I realized a lot of choice I make is not rational. 
I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. 
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. 
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity? 
I'm going to do some demonstrations. 
You ever see one of these before? 
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs." 
Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this. 
The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. 
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men. 
And she does it a few thousand times every day. 
You don't see a description of how, you know, Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule. 
The second thing is: speak up. 
And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age. 
They share, they give, they give away for free. 
Here, every single student has to engage with the material. 
Right now, as we sit here in this room, of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born, fully half aren't being taught to children. 
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet. 
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off. 
But yet she didn't stop. 
The problem was, that if you go with this idea -- this basic idea that space equals time in comics -- what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion, which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time, then they break with that continuity of presentation. 
Do they have food to take with the prescription? 
That's not the expression of joy. 
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical. 
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface. 
I was also pregnant at the time. 
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business, so you are going to muddle by, understaffed. 
We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. 
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. 
I doodled a lot as a kid, and if you spend enough time doodling, sooner or later, something happens: all your career options run out. 
We take our money and we give it away. 
What was his terrible crime? 
From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. 
I don't believe that. 
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing: if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale. 
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. 
We vanquished it. Puff. 
So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls. 
And it funds a lot of my research. 
That's my father. 
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa. 
So that's the first reason: zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. 
It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000. 
Now the largest aquifer in North America is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border, across eight states -- big aquifer: Ogallala, Triassic age. 
MK: It's only my wife who could be -- and if you knew her before she was injured, you would kind of understand this -- somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist, and then about a month ago, she says, "I want to learn Spanish again." 
This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace, a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York, where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. 
His voice is completely different, but he put his babysitter on the phone, and she was very nice to Randolph as well. 
First of all, electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue. 
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. 
Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. 
This is in a prototype stage. 
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?" 
We thrive not when we've done it all, but when we still have more to do. 
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core. 
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys, you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. 
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet, and there is the camera that's strapped to them. 
I thought every seven-year-old went through this. 
In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same, but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike. 
We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch, and end up as second class citizens. 
You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, "This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."

It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban. 
And that’s exactly what happens every time, every time you do this with adults. 
And since this was introduced in 1999, a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy, which is a prostate deep in the pelvis, and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome. 
You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh. 
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon. 
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts.

You see the rivers which are coming along the coast, and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island, and that looks like an ocean. 
And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on. 
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery, who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies. 
If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more, tribal divisions and so forth. 
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is -- it didn't actually happen. 
In fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were. 
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans, and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level, and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa. 
Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut. 
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid. 
So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really. 
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions, or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps, allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all. 
Now, doing this kind of work is not easy. 
That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories, it's probably not going to impact our lives at all. 
So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month, and then the magic happens. 
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up. 
And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important, you have these kinds of signals here. 
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. 
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory, systems engineers, where they create feedback loops, put the right information at the right point of time. 
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time, as they might confuse you or challenge you. 
I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. 
Well, in English class, in ninth grade, my friend John, who was sitting next to me, laughed a little bit too hard. 
And so cricket started becoming big; cricket started bringing riches in. 
And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine," and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book. 
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say, "Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!" 
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else. 
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. 
As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict, you can see why this context becomes very, very attractive. 
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina: too few crying children and smashed up houses. 
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of 33 stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years. 
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro. 
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition. 
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable, you get less miserable. 
Now I've taught you that battery science is straightforward and the need for grid-level storage is compelling, but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the demanding performance requirements of the grid -- namely uncommonly high power, long service lifetime and super-low cost. 
When I started in journalism -- Financial Times, 20 years ago -- it was very, very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. 
And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange. 
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation. 
This was more than 10 years ago, but ever since, my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. 
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses. 
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family. 
But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. 
We then process these husks with some basic equipment. 
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off. 
Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly. 
They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work, and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils. 
So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. 
Look at it now. 
It's essential to us. You can't escape it. 
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results. 
These are not the periods when you feel happiest. 
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket. 
It's a way for the world to handle this issue. 
I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. 
I had no joke for that. 
But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. 
it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives. 
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi, only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million. 
So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way: through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually, knowing that you have no such boundary, knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. 
Little, ring, middle, index. And then open. 
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. 
On the left there, Julia Platt, the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.

This one is a "third lung," a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment. 
The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. 
In the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. 
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics. 
I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies, and was commuting to work on my own, walking through town and taking the bus. 
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself." 
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank. 
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no, procreation is not the only purpose of marriage; what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment? 
This is a decrease by two-thirds. 
Video: Look at those ... 
Not this time of year -- it's more around October. 
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you. 
Have breakfast with my wife and children. 
In a lot of classrooms today you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. 
So, that's the U.K., and the population density of the U.K. 
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere. 
But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane, I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it. 
When I made the announcement, George did not turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business. 
So the light's setting on my left-hand side, and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach, the family of 30, all ages. 
I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise, big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures. 
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring, which I'll show you in just a second. 
The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle. 
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him. 
But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. 
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. 
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. 
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world, the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment. 
It was the same art, physically, but the history had changed. 
Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men." 
Malaria, HIV/AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. 
Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out. 
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. 
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. 
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly. 
You just gotta carry this thing around. 
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason. 
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. 
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that, but it's also kind of a nervous habit. 
It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country. 
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it, but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. 
And so you do get these kinds of contacts, and of course, being British and also growing up in France, I tend to be very blunt, and so I had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case, there probably wasn't that much in there to protect in the first place. 
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. 
So it's exciting potential for this. 
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says, I want you guys all to stop making chop suey, because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey. 
I knew she had come to say goodbye. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric. 
One option: you can create a new character, right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player. 
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds. 
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor. 
There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff. 
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world. 
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head. 
(Laughter) And that worked for a hundred years. 
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down. 
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there, they don't register their garments, generally, and there's not a lot of litigation. 
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. 
Because it's neither rare nor well done. 
One reason is a very smart five year-old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem -- look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win. 
And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed. 
I looked in the zippered pocket of one, and I found a printed card in English, which read, "An American classic. 
All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent, shameful issue that it is. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social, is I had to sell my work, and not myself. 
I watch reactions. 
And once you've trained up the detections, these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform, application or device. 
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling. 
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know. 
So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler, and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. 
This is what liberation really looks like. 
Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. 
(Applause) Now I know what some of you are thinking. 
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds, and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds, because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future. 
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. 
"I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way." 
Very few things went to the market. 
TT: Yeah, I did plug it in. 
One is interested in sweeping generalizations. 
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car, all of the parking and freeways and so on. 
And people still wonder why there are boys rotting, they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. 
If you went and looked for images of the Internet, this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it. 
MS: Walking all those holes? 
The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow. 
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact. 
(Music) Thank you. 
(Laughter) OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. 
So that's one thing, to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics. 
That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. 
Now we may think that's good or bad, but in either case it's real. 
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture. 
These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes, two ovaries, another large testis, more ovaries, which is not normal ...

Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle, so you must get ready and willing to die. 
(Laughter) And we sent it off, and by return mail it came back. 
So the wire heated up slightly, and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. 
I can help you with those later. 
It's my first international meet. 
But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. 
And the whole system goes into reverse. 
So how is that being accomplished here? 
And it's the dilemma that this Chinese man faces, who's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language, and yet he is sitting at his blackboard, converting Chinese phrases into English language phrases. 
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

So if you look at the little script here, the speed is always going to be 30. 
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you -- a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film. 
The same thing happens. 
So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area, national missing reports, and looked for accidents with a possible connection. 
Well, but this is something -- this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. 
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials. 
The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming, and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care, but deliver care in some radically different ways. 
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics. 
We don't want to believe what we know. 
Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible. 
So he could call evenly on men and women. And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better, and he was able to go back to them and tell them that. 
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. 
They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different. 
(Laughter) Now this museum is just as important to us as the West. 
And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. 
This is the quarter-scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. 
If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard? 
This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fi–enabled cameras. 
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions, and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions. 
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. 
We are at war with a new form of terrorism. 
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together." 
Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent. 
This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart, beautiful music, wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world. 
(Music) And this is a completely different song. 
So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing, but when things looks just natural, you also don't see them. 
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it. 
I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from, and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia, you see that there are a number of petrified forests, and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees, and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. 
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. 
So where do you set up your new factory? 
And then he turned to me, not stupidly, and he said, "What was your childhood like?" 
It did have a RAM pack. 
By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons. 
Should we be collecting it, gathering it, so we can make his online experience better? 
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable, except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job. 
For fashionistas, they want to stay ahead of the curve. 
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character, the one that spins around and around and around. 
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. 
So most of my work, I don't use glue. 
It was a game of hunting questions like this. 
What is it that we're concerned about? 
The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse. 
We live on a planet. 
We have superstar technologists. 
There's a significant difference. 
And there's a way for us to do that. 
(Laughter) Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world, but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices. 
This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team. 
You know. You can imagine what it is. 
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. 
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. 
Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett, who's the editorial cartoonist for the Lexington Herald-Leader. 
So it's not about getting two feet. 
These are pictures over about a six-second period. 
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. 
Okay. 
Capitalism has to be based on justice. 
I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though." 
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design? 
(Laughter) With our first kids, we did not know the science about brain development. 
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact. 
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world, or can we actually test for these extra dimensions? 
I asked her about her wish, and she said, "You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish." 
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation, but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies. 
And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before. 
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. 
So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation. 
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop." 
RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was, each one, actually, I think we came close. 
You can see this in the data. 
That is a transformation in power of ideas. 
We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement. 
Although every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too. 
Thank you very much. 
It's very, very, very significant. 
This is a village in southern Zambia. 
It's going to be much more complicated than that. 
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. 
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole, geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. 
So I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan. 
I had to tell them every little detail of everything. 
I was writing a book about sustainable energy, and a friend asked me, "Well how much energy do you use at home?" And I was embarrassed. I didn't actually know. 
And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars. 
She's my sister, my wife, my cousin, my neighbor. 
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay, the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC. 
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't. 
I've never seen anything like this. 
Now I should know, because for 13 years of my life, I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization. 
I was walking onto a plane -- this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career, and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing, the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them. 
You have anti-colonization. 
And so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000, not the other Sim City, that one in particular, so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong, and were not only criteria of selection. 
Nobody would want to give them up. 
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. 
And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. 
So every day in this country three million patients pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country. 
So if you put it in the front door, your design fails. 
I want you to imagine this for a moment. 
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front, and I climbed in the back. 
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment, only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. 
When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. 
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold. 
I have always, until now, called them all memes, but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes. 
Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury? Because that would prove your case.) Steven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes, I find very small differences in injury. 
So, we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country, and we found that most people could avoid surgery, and not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective. 
But it's self-evident assessment. 
Then you can see the English engineers looking on. 
And I have one small idea, and one big idea about what could happen. 
135 million-plus people. Think about that. 
Or perhaps, more relevantly, "Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?" 
Then I just pick things up. 
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances. 
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye, and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. 
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity. 
Because there were images in it he said were licentious. 
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in. 
He then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have, basically, the gonads of a falcon. 
Why not learn to fly upside down?" 
And that is the result, directly, of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production. 
Now, after searching high and low for several months, I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration. 
I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox. 
He was running a media systems organization which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business. 
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. 
We'd be pretty uncomfortable. 
Now, when I say that, some of you are starting to think, "Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?" 
Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50. 
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. 
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail. 
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. 
So every time you think about moving these people around, you think about high-capacity transportation. 
Last year, blogging live from an expedition that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest. 
And I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning, or to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda, the only option was total immersion. 
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way. 
But it's not in an institution, it was bought by a private owner in 1998. 
We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino, and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos. 
A very difficult time, actually. 
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices, to our search engines and our smartphones. 
They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out." 
So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. 
It's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things. 
The rational for the world’s first flight school goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say -- they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things, but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous -- they would come up and say, "Do you have a license for that?" 
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York. 
I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now, who have lost her children. 
My first evening, before my first day of school, I said to my mother, very politely, "Please wake me up at eight a.m." 
At the beginning, it was a disaster. 
I was going to have to ask for help. 
And now it's not that hard, you know, here's the apple, here's the orange, you know, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff. 
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs. 
So we run away from it, and where do we run? 
There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically. 
Scott's results were full of them. 
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s. 
I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101, so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go. 
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG. 
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise" and that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you," which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin. 
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed -- that's three thousand millionth seed -- is now stored. 
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm, capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago. 
And I thought, "These ants, are they looking for the queen ant? 
(Laughter) It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape. 
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies, but I want to highlight one particular one, and that is image parsing into objects. 
The Pharaoh got wind of this -- This is true, right off the Internet. 
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. 
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. 
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. 
And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific, it's slavery. 
We have a technology that works, and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves. 
We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said, "Our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace, and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020." 
Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me. 
300 to 500 million cases are reported. 
How will you cook your chicken now? 
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer. 
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. 
The universe is in our mind, and our minds are in the universe. 
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?" 
Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it, it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something very simply, where you take one idea from a body, and it happens to be my body, and translate that into somebody else's body, so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy. 
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves. 
Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact. 
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic. 
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks. 
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter. 
Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. 
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I," as we might say in English. 
So you have to do it with the local people. 
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. 
It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago, white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way. 
We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments, and that are going to struggle to learn to read, is that their language processor is created in a defective form. 
But this is a simple signal, and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals. 
And that can be seen directly through a microscope, and I'm going to show you some of this today. 
Well, right now in the United States, 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution, and vehicles are about 25,000 of those. 
And humor is a good way, I think, to address serious issues. 
CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about, want to turn your resources toward? 
Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense. 
I want to point at something here, on the left. 
But who is this person? 
What do we do with these numbers? 
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other." 
The cancer cells, small, round and rapidly dividing, grew these arms and extensions. 
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes. 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. 
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life. 
I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. 
We have become very removed from what our bread really is, which, again, evolutionarily speaking, is very strange. 
We saw how PS 234 worked. 
Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was, you aim for the bush in the distance, and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree. 
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand. 
Cognitively, they can understand artificially-created languages. 
And they no longer have to be exactly the same. 
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. 
Wondering, therefore, how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen. 
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. 
In 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness," a tale of grim horror along the Congo River. 
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right? 
I can't teach how to do it, because there are so many different ways. 
And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus, especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it, the scale, is very interesting to me. 
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them. 
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic, in breaking records. 
This is a blueprint how to survey your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends whom an email, all this is possible if you have access to this information. 
Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident, but the heart muscle has died. 
All other species on this planet are gene machines only, they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all. 
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability. 
He says, "It's really brought us closer together through the years. 
And protect another million jobs now at risk, mainly in auto-making. 
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night, thinking, "Make it go away." 
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species. 
It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers. 
So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting. 
AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England, about two hours south of London, and I'm the only person in the United States with these, which is a crime because they are so beautiful. 
Here is my well-loved iPhone. 
And here it is, figure-ground. 
So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices, but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. 
The next concern was whether I would walk again, because I was paralyzed from the waist down. 
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long, but with the war on terror and everything, the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever. 
This is perhaps my favorite. 
And we're entering an era of really, truly scarless surgery called NOTES, where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically. 
(Applause) The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression, unless it is so clinically brutal, man. 
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. 
CA: Why? 
So we launched Crisis Text Line, very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market. 
We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. 
They just have to raise their hands. 
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape. 
(Laughter) But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this, which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 
I think of meditation. 
We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well. 
(Laughter) And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community, they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom. 
So there is sweat dripping off my head, because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position. 
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months. 
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. 
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline. 
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. 
And as I went village to village, I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted, and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree, and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me. 
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in, but it still does some pretty cool stuff. 
They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now, and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse. 
But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence. 
That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture, from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that, you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it pretty quickly. 
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. 
And here it is with the abstract surrounding. 
Did I know anything about this? 
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of, could cross the two sides -- it was a good time. 
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water. 
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 
He actually coined the term cymatics. 
(Video) MK: You okay? You did great. GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you. 
Just because it sounds so good. 
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. 
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine. 
I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me." 
So just imagine: one day very soon, you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. 
You look at that lane on the right. 
(Laughter) I skied on for a week past the Pole. 
Other outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries; denial of financial resources; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children, who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. 
I got interested in gene sequencing. 
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. 
The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going. 
The last thing I'll show you, the last behavioral time machine, is something that I created with Hal Hershfield, who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project, Bill Sharpe. 
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. 
But what was credible, what is biological and scientific fact, is that we all stem from Africa -- in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago. 
The usual sort of thing. 
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer. 
We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers, and you should do the same thing, but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. 
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. 
So I want to show you another landscape now. 
They lay the eggs into fresh water. 
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse. 
This is what we would love students to retain, even if they don't go into mathematical fields. 
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia. 
Armani -- who said Armani? You? 
(Applause) I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana, West Africa. 
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut, who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15, and he was there to basically double check my science. 
For example, all the courageous TEDTalks: "People dying," or "People suffering," was also one, "with easy solutions around." 
Shaheen's background I don't even know. 
So these proof of concept experiments led me to say "I should found a company, and we should take this out to a wider playing field." 
So here's a Nankani village in Mali. 
So, book writing is the same thing. 
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin, it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh. 
Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then. 
DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. 
(Applause) Let me introduce to you Rezero. 
Three years ago, she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. 
Because of fast fashion, global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to. 
Have you been watching the commercials? 
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people. 
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective. 
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community. 
So here, here I have to peek, lots of cards. 
Well, if that ruins your life, well then you shouldn't live there. 
Now that last mile, last foot, in a sense, is the first step of the infrastructure. 
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work. 
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie. 
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets, and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories, and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded. 
There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again, to be part of community again, to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable, and it's very exciting. So, thank you. 
The stone axe was made by someone for himself. 
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel. 
But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one. 
Kafka did not show his work to his father. 
And I gathered together, honestly, the world's leading experts in every possible way. 
So I felt that I needed to do two things. 
(Laughter) Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding, it's worth stealing. 
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today. 
Whether they support Islamists or liberals, Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical, and they are jobs, stability and education, not moral policing. 
More recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head, which is a little creepy, but pretty cool. 
And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses, you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve, because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are, the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything. 
If you go down to five percent, you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos. 
Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression, our universal language of expression, our social-signaling system. 
Dick, he was my friend. I did call him Dick. 
And the thing about it, I've done this for years, the younger they are, the more fun it is. 
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. 
The dance community is now global. 
And you put lots of those together, you get the essentials of the modern computer: the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory, the recording medium, the input and the output. 
So for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. 
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq. 
And for me and my community, this project was a huge success. 
And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis. 
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. 
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. 
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek? 
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces, you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own. 
What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman. 
And two years in, I really could see very little. 
In this part of the Internet, you will not find a single lolcat, a single pop-up advert anywhere. 
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen. 
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation. 
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. 
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place, suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable. 
You know, it's very interesting. 
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart. 
But there's a fourth thing. 
And this is exactly why I started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves. 
And we'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. 
And so please consider this a work in progress, but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma, about the protein target, the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer, called BRD4, and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute called JQ1, which we affectionately named for Jun Qi, the chemist that made this molecule. 
(Laughter) They are the toughest opponents. 
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree, it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it. 
And I couldn't get this information out. 
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in. 
But instead I saw this.

Sir Francis Bacon once said, "When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before, it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before." 
When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. 
The academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous, so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser. 
Because people like me took your job. 
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. 
We believe there's some water in the polar caps, there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. 
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around, refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever, possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks. 
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS -- now that's rocket science. 
This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. 
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important. 
That's a way to do it. 
Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. 
And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things: First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white. 
Here you see the city. 
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. 
Of course not. 
I don't even know if you can see that in the back row. These are just stars. 
So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children, provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help? 
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. 
Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. 
Now, as I said, you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. 
So spinning forward, one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart, and he was a U.S. Air Force officer. 
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. 
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi. 
Well — (Applause) — I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America, boldly going to a strange new world, seeking new opportunities. 
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained. 
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live, and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology. 
Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. 
the most devastating case of complete deforestation? 
It's whatever moves you personally. 
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for." 
Foreign policy, you can figure that out by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody, but — (Laughter) — I want to talk about young people and structure, young people and structure. 
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. 
And we're seeing nations in Africa. 
It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency. 
We forget how harsh his vision was. 
And all of a sudden ... 
This is a system that's been around a very long time. 
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie. 
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people, a mix of graduate students, post-docs and even some undergraduates. 
The ocean has properties that allow low-frequency sound to basically move globally. 
Once the infrastructure becomes generically available, the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals. 
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. 
And it's not just our honeybees. 
That's what it feels like to me. 
I mean, think about Wall Street. 
"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks. 
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project? 
And finally, the lab started doing invention. 
This can be integrated with decisions support. 
One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina, and suddenly, these silent sparks rose up all around me, and I began to wonder: How do these creatures make light, and what's with all this flashing? 
My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. 
So here's a new definition for doodling. 
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth. 
The instructor says, "You are participating." 
We had to see the world through her eyes. 
It's an amazing improvement, from seven children per woman, they've gone all the way down to between four and five. 
So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. 
(Laughter) Hello! 
You're in this extended body. 
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science -- this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter) And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. 
Now your task is to move objects around. 
And I decided that I had compromised, just like my friends in those discussions, where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for, rather than taking responsibility for. 
But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger, which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. 
As soon as the door closed... 
So all we have is this record. (Laughter) But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object -- one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it. 
In you, in me, mind and body and spirit. 
Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. 
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world. 
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month. 
Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered, led by a theory. 
How can we make this go faster? 
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities." 
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. 
Why is that? 
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other, and when I leave, two hours later, most of them are saying about 2 billion people, and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion, nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem. 
We're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording, presenting, processing information. 
So I asked myself: Do I write stuff for specific rooms? 
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth, that things over time were getting better? 
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. 
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. 
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable. 
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things. 
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something, or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas. 
(Audience: Once on purpose!) DH: How about if I try first and then decide? 
You can put social innovation to the same rigorous, scientific tests that we use for drugs. 
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators. 
It's our health, our social behavior, and our productivity as well. 
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen, and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all. 
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. 
Now I use this word "ignorance," of course, to be at least in part intentionally provocative, because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and I clearly don't mean any of those. 
So, you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. 
So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life.

They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission, which is the landing. 
Well no, not pieces of plastic, but stone seals, copper tablets, pottery and, surprisingly, one large sign board, which was found buried near the gate of a city. 
They produced flyers. They called offices. 
After all, where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents?

I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. 
They produce sameness. 
If you're interested in giving it a try, I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. 
And finally, the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad. 
And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. 
But the height here, I want to point out, is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media. 
Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing, see what is going in Darfur. 
I should say this. There's some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality, which we are expressing by what we do. 
(Laughter) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you'll start to notice. 
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 
Being run over is never easy. 
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave, foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology, various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies. 
I look at this photo, and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button, but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. 
I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. 
(Laughter) Now this is probably a good thing, right? 
But there will always be another war." 
When people say nothing can change, just stop and think what the world was like 10, 20, 50, 100 years ago. 
If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
And there's no adaption. 
This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. 
If we feel it now and think it through, we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself. 
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate, but by golly, they are qualified. 
Instead, we spend our time talking. 
Thank you very much. 
Why can everyone do it? 
I believe that for every person on the planet. 
All video games are violent. 
My downstairs neighbor, Alessandra, was completely shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese." 
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively. 
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time. 
And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create. 
And here was him, denying. 
It's a tremendous improvement. 
And of course, it's a very, very risky trial position, and that's why it's very hard to get funding, but to a first approximation, that's actually the proposal. 
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader, but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ... 
Where can I go today and who can I do it with? 
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome. 
But it is a cruel, vicious, absolutely conscienceless -- I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) -- game that these people play. 
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama, and I would hand them out. 
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father. 
When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever, you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people, but you can't talk to them. 
And when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth. 
SP: I agree with the president. 
DK: So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention. 
Let me tell you another thing we could do. 
Tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches." 
So how do you know if your breasts are dense? 
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months. 
It's an Arabic-medium school. 
It protects the birds. 
(Laughter) Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? 
And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it; get help. 
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. 
(Applause) A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach, I met Harriet. 
This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot. 
And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class. 
Compare the banker in 1900, who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage. 
I'll get into why that is in just a minute. 
(Laughter) She never would have thought of herself as a feminist, my mother, but she always used to say, "Anything a man can do, I can fix." 
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked. 
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand. 
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise, and reflect in the line through X. 
One was post-traumatic stress disorder. 
And I love Maynard Sipes, but he's off in his own world, and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid. 
We need to think about how to open up the API of government, and the way that we're going to do that, the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution -- because we have to maintain those public values, we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks, all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions, to engage in the practice of governance. 
In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law. 
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo. 
I've written books about the history of space, the history of physics and religion, and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times. 
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. 
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations. 
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment. 
And, as with jazz, the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others. 
And this, in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned, equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources. 
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. 
So, this is the data I just showed, OK? 
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish. 
People think that now that we have digital technology, the book is going to die, and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving. 
A replica of this is at the United Nations. 
Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan." 
And you know, these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. 
Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it? 
I believe, number one, it's complacency. 
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made, the EV1, out of -- and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart. 
On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance, dining hall, etc. 
Who among us would actually say that people read this? 
And you push them together and they repel. 
It makes products more affordable. 
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. 
The first one is in the crisis itself. 
So one day after school he went into a house As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door, He wondered why he’d never introduced himself before, As she let him in, his jaw dropped in awe. 
So that is the program, embarrassingly simple, but as we're going to see, extremely powerful. 
We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors. 
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. 
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. 
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note." 
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. 
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back, and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt, and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight, which had then been around for -- (Laughter) -- 17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds, which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars. 
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word, bad things can happen. 
We're pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. 
If we really want to come to a point, we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission, we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like India. 
And the guy who is working there with them, he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha." 
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. 
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational, if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease, we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. 
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. 
This is clearly not a good arrangement. 
They cannot replace government. 
How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost? How do you do it? 
Again, whether we're talking health policy, education, environment, energy, litigation, mergers, all of these are complicated problems that are predictable, that this sort of technology can be applied to. 
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio. 
I asked him, "Why?" 
And that brings me to another aspect of this, which is, to whom should this get paid? 
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world. 
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. 
My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?" 
And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are, in fact, the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to, as we should, because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds. 
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s. 
And this is in the past four million years. 
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government. 
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium. 
(Applause) So recently, some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online. 
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down. 
And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale, I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. 
You see above, at the top, a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z. 
This is in the Scottish Parliament. 
We need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing, who killed patients in the course of his early operations. 
And after that, we succeeded. 
So, to make cooking really a very important element, I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. 
Well, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also. 
But that sounds really techie. 
Like, have you ever thought when you buy a car, how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect you're playing a non-zero-sum game with. 
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network, a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit. 
(Laughter) Another half an hour after 12 days. 
What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments. 
(Applause) EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. 
They see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from. 
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. 
Now to move and to balance, Rezero needs to turn the ball. 
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it, but I've tried to take it to some new places. 
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach? 
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up. 
They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business. 
The other, in nuances. 
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More. 
And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you, which is the first film that Charles ever made. 
Printing press took a century to be adopted; the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers. 
And he was great. He just gave her a big hug in return, and it worked out great. 
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time. 
(Laughter) And so this is what I did. 
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this, and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now, and it's about time we did. 
I discard it. 
Last week, I was in Ghana with the minister of health, because if you don't know, there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment. 
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive. 
Because we live in such a noisy world. 
In other words, I can trust him or her. 
Everybody's got to work together -- China and the U.S. 
Right across the developing world, citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change, positive change, in their own communities. 
(Applause) It's a great pleasure to be here. 
On the left is water coming through the shore, taken from a NASA satellite. 
And that's the power of storytelling. 
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler, who somehow summons will, that last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone, after many, many hours and days out there. 
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months and the power doubles, right? 
And yet, even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries, we don't. 
And when the Web came along, that changed everything, because not only could we find information, we could find other people like ourselves who could gather, who could bring us information. 
I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased. 
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me? 
This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device -- among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit. 
I think that I've designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy, provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications, and I'm really prepared to do this. 
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. 
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this." 
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there. 
I mean, just to put it in perspective, 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. 
And of course, Nano has 17. 
There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market. 
And I think of this as a kind of existential wake-up call. 
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells? 
The controllers are, of course, part of the experience, so you cannot do away with it. 
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?" 
They're learning who they are. 
And you may wonder why. 
One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing, this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this. 
So I want to show you a clip of the film now. 
We need better tools. 
The wall was covered with ... 
Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born. 
Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing. 
They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. 
There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind. 
Google is a company born of idealism. 
So this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment. 
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. 
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope, a platform for fluorescence, bright-field, polarization, projection, all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. 
And in the measure that we map ourselves, this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. 
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems. 
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile. 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. 
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves. 
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models, they provide full protection from infection. 
And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service. 
And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it. 
We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year, and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue. 
Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. 
Then the sound came again, forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw." 
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit. 
So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life. 
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. (Music) It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be ... (Music) Do you see what I mean? So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well. 
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three, increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code, the models immediately started to look more natural. 
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.

And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I, made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. 
My job was to ask this question: "What do the stories look like?" 
So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. 
(Laughter) Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word. 
But it takes a lot to get there. 
The second piece it brings is rigor. 
And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated. 
So that's all I'm going to say about that. 
To be a lesbian, a dyke, a homosexual in most parts of the world, including right here in our country, India, is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice. 
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy. 
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. 
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection. 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack." 
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but this has got something else in it. 
If you don't know it, it's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that, it's got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit. 
We're trying to reduce the prison population. 
So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers? 
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot, which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe, but we know that in the world of nonfiction, the GPS dot is impossible, right? 
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. 
Now, I understand it. I do understand it. 
I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can't avoid. 
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think, well maybe you think that's okay. 
(Laughter) Duct tape. 
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. 
Another update: You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker. 
I know this might be broadcast broadly. 
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular, a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing, which I could also see. 
The cable over there, that's an optical fiber. 
It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. 
In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. 
Thank God I announced the locations and everything. 
Neil Selinger, to me, is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act. 
And in this epoch, which extends from late in the first year of life to death; it's actually doing this under behavioral control. 
All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. 
This particular idea, however -- although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong, and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years, may tell us whether it's right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research. 
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?" 
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer. 
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. 
You have a huge spread due to movement variability. 
But what I think comes next is far more interesting. 
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball, and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball. 
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. 
And they said they were having an exhibition about artists' response to global warming, and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it. 
(Laughter) MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often at a colossally slow pace, but my wife, and I have to admit, a lot of other members of Congress that I know, work incredibly hard. 
It's not true. Authority, in fact, is essential to freedom. 
In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world. 
Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres? 
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. 
And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate, it's really important to look at them as one system. 
Audience: Shake. 
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. 
We started this over 15 years ago. 
(Applause) That's really amazing. 
Timed degradation: packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue. 
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over America. 
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. 
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983, and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today: because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause) Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images. 
(Laughter) It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are. 
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" 
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. 
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper-innovative, and I think it represents the black swan of medicine. 
Now, I know you don't believe me, really, here. 
Now in order to do this, the design challenge of our century, I think, we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses, and to somehow meet them again. 
When I read something, it will read in my voice. 
Very simple example. 
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself, is what's this new way that the world is? 
We've forgotten that second part. 
You may know one line of it, it says, "I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy." 
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. 
(Laughter) So I want to show you some prototypes. 
And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day. 
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. 
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family. 
You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. 
The great poem of John Donne's. 
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right? 
That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay, and that’s amazing. 
So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label, something like that, in a diagram of him. 
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be. 
I met Mahmoud one year later. 
But above all, they started to do serious business with the world of crime. 
When that group started to move, the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets, bombs, and then the gas. 
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do, and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures. 
That's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land. 
But -- and here's that hurdle -- can we afford our aid aspirations? 
As you can see, I have high cholesterol. 
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas, where I grew up in the early part of my life. 
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. 
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. 
Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment? 
(Laughter) So something interesting had to be going on. 
What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories. 
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project. 
Look at that. What are you feeling about it? 
Some of them committed suicide. 
One moment it was all white space, pure possibility. 
Have a listen. 
And so that's why I think, personally, that toys can change the world. 
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology. 
And he was like, "Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States." 
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark. 
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right? 
(Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that. 
But when you start to read the article by Cliff, who himself is a cancer survivor, who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for -- at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life, he makes remarkable points here. 
Hello, Eleanor, please ... 
I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do. 
Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm. 
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle, and pass these cars, then that's not very nice. 
They call themselves the Elder Brothers. 
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. 
There are some dilemmas you see. 
Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front. 
If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative, and we started thinking about food as health, then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch. 
Currently, what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats, and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt. 
They hugged. 
One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. 
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris, trying to explain his theory. 
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts, like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding, everything that's cooled in the supermarket, there's gelatin to make it look good. 
That leads to example number three: hitchhiking. 
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person. 
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started. 
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. 
I still haven't given up my hope to see you. 
This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code, and the dependencies of one law on other laws for the overall effect. 
It's why Google is Google, and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games. 
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. 
And it's kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary, or any of the birds that have crests on their heads, they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow. 
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding, because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on. 
So he looked into this, and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires. 
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing. 
Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents are for concussions. 
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light. 
This is the way we should be going into the oceans. 
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin. 
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this. 
(Whistling) (Laughter) ♫ My preacher said, ♫ ♫ Don't you worry ♫ ♫ The scientists have it all wrong ♫ ♫ And so, who cares it's winter here? ♫ ♫ And I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ I have my halter-top on ♫ ♫ Everyone's out in merry Manhattan in January. ♫ (Applause) Chris Anderson: Jill Sobule! 
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying. 
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism. 
(Laughter) "Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem." 
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode in our post-war history. 
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries. 
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity. 
It's amazing, isn't it? 
And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace. 
Where did they get that inspiration? 
Now we could compute something related to this, let's say ... the GDP of Spain divided by, I don't know, the -- hmmm ... 
I called her back, and that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head. 
So how do we think about these questions? 
So you translate that to the building industry, if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, "Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. 
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom. 
They seemed to speak to me. 
But that's not what we did. 
That's important. 
There's no Ras, no Myc, no P53 drug. 
That's called growth. 
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball -- took him on his shoulder. 
And governments have not been able to provide clean water. 
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple's a great example. 
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore. 
Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep, and not in good ways. 
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition. 
If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry? 
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. 
You've got Lady Gaga. 
Thank you very much. 
Whole dissertations could be written about it, and probably are being written about it. 
And in a more subtle way, I think, this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability: the bribes, threats, propositions, solicitations and so on. 
So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa. 
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. 
It'll over-index Hispanic and urban. 
The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C. 
Look around you -- here will do, in this room. 
I wanted that wish to actually start now. 
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family. 
I started using four cylinders. 
These are hundreds of classes. 
I'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices, just that we develop a more self-aware relationship with them, with each other and with ourselves. 
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization. 
Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. 
And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor, you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!" 
Sixty-eight is young today. 
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Wow. 
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before. 
And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now, you're thinking, so why should I really care about this, right? 
I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing." 
Today might be the only time that these two things coincide, such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give. 
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play. 
We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities. 
And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. 
We look at a map like this one, and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away. 
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are? 
Our city is very spread out. 
And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again. 
It's actually about three percent. 
So we started the company. 
There's none of what is called the "chemo head." 
And having said to your dad, Nic, that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused as to how I might go about that if I wasn't allowed near the piano. 
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. 
They have turned against human efforts. 
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. 
And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome. 
From a distance, Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties, always making girls feel pretty. 
The fact that it happens in "Another Country" takes you quite by surprise. 
It's written there, "Theft." 
The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons. 
And during a lot of this work, we found something, or I found something, that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it. 
The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body, makes them part of its flesh and blood. 
(Laughter) The world is my playground. 
My story is actually not about plant propagation, but about pollen itself. 
And that's about it. 
And this open-source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly. 
The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing. 
So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been back and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this, and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify. 
(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 
We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. 
Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide, and reach great numbers, while in war, if anything turns out happily, the advantage redounds only to a few, and those unworthy of reaping it. 
But the other thing they needed was speed. 
So the three-year-old does two things differently. 
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. 
And I love this one, because it's also what we're about. 
All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent. 
We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. 
And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence, end in the middle of a sentence. 
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house. 
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. 
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week. 
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow, and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down, we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across. 
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs? 
And so I think we can roll the video that we have. 
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful, because there's many different frequencies. 
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level. 
But that began thinking about how birds went around, and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly, and then other planes, and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged, was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place, but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider, but three times the span, three times the cord. 
In my last 18 months as a lawyer, battling small- and large-scale corruption, including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. 
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. 
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby, this wonderful nuclear physicist, and he said that media had a responsibility, that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward. 
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Seven nations are involved in building this. 
There's no damage outside. 
So, one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. 
We share 98.8 percent of the genes. 
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things. 
In a sense, it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition, something you can observe, that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand. 
Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture. 
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it. 
And a team rarely can do it. 
Let's see what evolution can do for us. 
And their farms are also large. 
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that," they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, "Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should," they were characterized as low efficacy. 
You think of carbon as black. 
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California. 
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn, Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system, so if I just keep letting this go, you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that. 
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. 
(Laughter) Not appropriate. No. No. 
My God, it's unbelievable. 
I used to make stuff up. Right? 
The average depth is about two miles. 
Three of them were having incomplete proofs. 
So here's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate, a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal, and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron, and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago, and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials. 
It was invented by Confucius. 
And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio. 
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. 
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands. 
I had two earlier in England. 
In the schools and communities that Taio works in, the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question. 
And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers. 
But just keep staring at it. 
And when I tell people about this, they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80. 
In 1999, two and a half years into that job, something happened. 
And I started reading his books after that lecture. 
We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever as a city, to live in peace. 
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some -- it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria -- actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant. 
What is this for? 
Now, as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that, I found that exciting. But so what? 
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. 
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty. 
So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4, which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are. 
And we're starting to make our way. 
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up. 
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done. 
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night, that would also be bad. 
I found out how many people had been put in jail, how many family members had been killed. 
But then I started feeling bad. 
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. 
Add some more. 
They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them. 
The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most. 
So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa. 
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. 
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier. 
This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. 
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself. 
Take the holy trinity of efficiency: clarity, measurement, accountability. 
The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. 
I'm passionate about this topic. 
There are tons of places to go, online and off, if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving. 
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. 
So this will be the typical workflow situation. 
Here is where we were, and this is the painting. 
It's a waste product. 
You can think of it as a way of, sort of, typing, with your eyes. 
Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. 
That you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged. 
Then onto other parts of the country, I repeated this over and over again, getting exactly the same results that we were. 
(Laughter) And I was happy to tell her all about it. 
There's been four billion years of organic, biological life. 
Good morning everybody. 
So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round. 
And what's more, it's actually a tree. 
And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. 
And these are the things that we're funded to do today. 
One linear, one cyclical. 
Now you probably know the answer to this already. 
You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. 
So this is a time of great change. 
The threat to worry about isn't strangers. 
I met humble people. 
But technology alone is not enough. 
And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south. 
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines, one of whom was cited in the film, and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy, because even at 500 dollars, these drugs were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis. 
(Laughter) She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very, very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine, then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. 
And then he describes the home he owned in their village. 
In the middle years of the century, polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. 
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible. 
In most adventure games, it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience. 
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine. 
At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much. 
Take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today. 
The company itself had about 10,000 employees, and they're doing domestic shoes. 
(Applause) I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure. 
Then these labs started doing serious problem solving -- instrumentation for agriculture in India, steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana, high-gain antennas in thin client computers. 
What's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software. 
I started writing fiction in English. 
NK: Thank you. 
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things, so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world. 
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not. 
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. 
I totally want to go to that wedding. 
I got a lot wrong. 
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day, standing fully upright in cowboy boots. 
He just hangs out. He's relaxed. 
This is ... does somebody know? 
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity. 
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together, just now like victims for every baby, six have disappeared from the forest. 
(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox. 
You can also do this with solar cells.

Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it -- although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story. 
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA. 
Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you, it's not good for you? 
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V. 
Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.

The governments of the world are taking this really seriously. 
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors. 
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep. 
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model, and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy, this is basically going against headwinds, but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.

He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there. 
Again, small to large is relevant here. 
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed, because national e-markets will deliver data. 
Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. 
So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day, or her own day, which I think artists are obliged to do, is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. 
This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.

So I just figured that out earlier. 
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill. 
It's not only the giving of answers. 
But here's what we can say: what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. 
It might be that some massive network of communications, or some shield against asteroidal impact, or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of, could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies that a determined program of searching might detect. 
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently, and if we can get others seeing business differently, we can change the world. 
But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky: no claws, flat fur, soft eyes, open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements, curvilinear movements -- all specific to play. 
And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme, to do terrible things. 
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter) It's an amazing phenomenon. 
And Feynman also understood this. 
They can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark, a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.

If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer, the easiest answer, of course, is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do.

Can economic growth get us to the Global Goals? 
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. 
(Applause) I want to talk today about -- I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view. 
Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget. 
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. 
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest. 
Mm-hm. 
So we just put that sign on it that said, "Out of order. Come back yesterday." (Laughter) And that ended up being a better joke than slushies, so we just left it there forever. 
This is the Africa of opportunity. 
That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable. 
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. 
It says that, if your friends are obese, your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher. 
In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. 
My head snapped back over my red seat. 
But it rarely happens in biology. 
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within. 
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. 
Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it, and yet one of them, heptyl acetate, has the distinct odor of a pear, and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana. 
At this moment, I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. 
Just give me your company logo. 
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself. 
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar, and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town. 
But you can see that it's extremely faint. 
You know, was there something actually out there? 
And there was this person, Muriel Cooper. 
Complex civilizations do that, because they operate, most of the time, on the edge of chaos. 
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game: Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you. 
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. 
Where do we find the most species of ocean life? 
Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this. 
Is there a place for me in the world out there? 
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year. 
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage, the cartilage never comes back. 
It looks a bit like this. 
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see, there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high. 
But if you show them that it's in their interest, then they're responsive. 
I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things. 
My favorite example is a pair of twins, one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany, the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. 
And across the world today, we see a sort of cyber arms race, with cyberwar units built up by countries like North Korea or even Iran. 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. 
Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect, is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right? 
So this is all of the meta-data information. 
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them. 
And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions. 
They're not statistically significant. 
He makes us the subject of his art. 
Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums, a second story building, the only second story building inside the slums. 
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. 
And he works this system. 
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment." 
He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan." 
CA: Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish? 
And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan -- (Laughter) -- and land it before ... 
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of. 
Do you remember, I gave you those filters at the beginning. 
Now the reason we know it's 1584 is that these corals have growth bands. 
I want to start fresh. I want to start fresh." 
The cold colors, the blue and the black, show areas where we have almost no data. 
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. 
We give our algorithms tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling, from different ethnicities, ages, genders, and we do the same for smirks. 
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes." 
And I think it'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow. 
As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out, I leave the scene immediately. 
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. 
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home. 
And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium. 
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now. 
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. 
People applaud in delight. 
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. 
And I do believe you should stay with us. 
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. 
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane. 
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body. 
It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean. 
Ten minutes into the date, the man stands up and says, "I'm not interested," and walks out. 
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads. 
And of course we need to worry about the individuals, particularly the individuals that feel that they've been left out in one way or another. 
So's Germany, and Japan is consuming a bit more. 
Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep. 
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through, and in other areas, it's a ventilating system, so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. 
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus, I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings, the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. 
And then the message cascades into the amygdala, and then goes down the autonomic nervous system. 
Another thing that helped me as a little kid is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners. 
Now, when I was in my early 20s, I worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records, and I had no idea what a great job I had. 
This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter) But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people, do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale, if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it, tell governments we want to see an end to food waste, we do have the power to bring about that change. 
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. 
Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. 
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly. 
Loving elephants as I do, that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life, and I will carry that to my grave. 
Jee gets to have his project; the public gets a sweeter environment; and different public gets a place to express itself; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads. 
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart. 
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing. 
And a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way. 
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose, but I'll just have to narrow it down to one, but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway. 
So after leaving him, I went back to personnel, and talking to the clerk, he said, "Jim, I think I have a solution for you. 
No one was interested in oil spills. 
Oh, you're wiggling your toes. 
You can see it in their faces. 
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug, integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had, the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it. 
And I was in the hospital for months. 
So, life -- long lifespans -- like, that is to say, much more than 30 -- weren't selected for, but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. 
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. 
As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense, and I learned to say phrases in Latin, but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top-down morality applied to everybody. 
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques. 
So many times, amateurs, not experts, have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors, personal computers, airplanes. 
So, you can already see the surprise. 
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign, very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. 
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. 
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge. 
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. 
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. 
Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... " These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it. 
This is the sort of general area of the treatment. 
The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution of a quantum entity -- a particle, like an electron, which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. 
He named it homunculus. 
How much -- what's the total revenue? 
So what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country, and the price to entry into this competition used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion, which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than one tenth of one percent of federal spending. 
How did Movember start? 
But it also predisposes people to death from all other causes. 
(Applause) By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites. 
Professor: Tendai is working very independently. 
One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. 
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall. 
So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. 
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have. 
11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question? 
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision on top of the physical world. 
You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. 
AM: Well, these are my pretty legs. 
Only my husband should be seeing my panties. 
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud. 
And there's a day's worth of our cups. 
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas. 
Many of you will know the story. 
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels. 
And in that pair, one person gets a message saying, "Do you want to give up some of your $10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab?" 
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change. 
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade, and he went in under my elbow, and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. 
(Applause) It's a small message from us, in our own small way to the enemies of humanity, of Islam, of South Asia, of India, and of Pakistan, that humanity will continue to bloom, irrespective of such dastardly attacks. 
His parents think sometimes it's a precious commodity, so they'll keep it in a cupboard. 
The title is "This Happened." 
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam. 
They did not make it to university. 
The officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled. 
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God. 
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. 
This is violence. 
By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours, outstripping human ability to review it all, but even that number is about to go up drastically. 
In the ocean, it's the rule rather than the exception. 
I hope I've opened your eyes, if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter) to some of pollen's secrets. 
And the lines look curved. 
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. 
And that means, when you multiply it up, the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery is something like 10.8 billion dollars -- what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels, what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system: usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans, or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people, we spent 10.8 billion dollars. 
He found that they were resistant to deducing the hypothetical, to speculating about what might be, and he found finally that they didn't deal well with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. 
So what do we need to do? 
And in many places, they're there. 
But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns, it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body. 
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff. 
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. 
"I think so." 
♫ Plato in the cave with those very young boys. ♫ Sweeney: Ooh... 
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation, methane from animals and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing. 
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know. 
Thank you. 
Similarly, when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak, I'm interacting with reality, but that reality is not a lion or a steak. 
And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government, protecting us. 
(Laughter) He said, "And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe. 
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. 
The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room. 
And ultimately, we have to try that. 
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. 
Unimprovable, right on time as usual, more on cue than a snooker ball but liked to play it super cool. 
We face different opponents across these three. 
And they get to prioritize, you know? 
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard -- with a material, with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces: wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes. 
Thank you. 
The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning. 
Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other? 
It only has to solve one little problem. 
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. 
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place. 
And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent, to be convicted of murdering them. 
These plants, several hundred million years old. 
But at the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong. 
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning, and it would be on live TV, if we have interesting things to show. 
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. 
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes. 
They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. 
This phenomenon is modernity. 
Oh, well. 
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask. 
The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts, it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets. 
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great." 
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer. 
I think we need to consider everything, everything from alpha to OMEGA. 
There was tension in my wire, but I also could feel tension on the ground. 
"Did it hurt?" 
We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. 
So, look, if we could have this screen live. 
It is a papercutting, and then after, I added color on the computer. 
So I'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge, if you will. 
Not likely. 
And Scott aggregated all of the videos. 
This is a girls' bedroom. 
We're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. 
And also, my husband does a lot around the house, and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives. 
And I talked to a bunch of people about, should I give a speech at TEDWomen about women, and they said, oh no, no. 
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. 
But how will we know? How will we come to know? 
I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. 
And will you buy someone else's sample? 
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time. 
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it. 
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. 
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again, because, of course, they don't -- because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. 
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. 
When I was a kid, I was going to school, I was coming back every holiday to Gando. 
And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds. 
The word "addiction" is thrown around. 
But what is the tendency of this example? 
The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. 
The second thing is, the health issue. 
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked on Airbnb in the past six months alone. 
(Laughter) And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. 
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick. 
Not very sustainable. 
I'm not alone, and I am loved. 
Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy. 
Also, a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer. 
And she answered, "A penis." 
I hope that you will all, if you've been moved by this presentation, join with the growing international community to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities, to convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion instead of a climate change villain, and to say no to the tar sands, and yes to a clean energy future for all. 
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains, I hoped that, the next morning, my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food. 
CC: A-rhythm a-rhythm. Audience: A-rhythm a-rhythm. 
But it's not just skin-deep. 
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability, like this human inside this dinosaur suit. 
(Applause) So if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation, what would you say? 
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. 
We tend to, all of us -- even those of us who work in marketing -- to think of value in two ways. 
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda. 
Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?

Art is about two things in all the major faiths. 
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors. 
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. 
At 12. 
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs. 
It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone, and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour. 
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. 
"I don't understand. Soybeans? 
So we have two prototypes. 
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds., you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry. 
Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries? 
And this picture was taken by ATLAS. 
I was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?" 
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender, income, race, and class. 
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet, 24,000 species are safe; 30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year. 
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force, which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today, but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. 
College sports teams say, "We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance, and if you don't measure up or you don't show up, we're going to cut you off the team. 
Within Britain, there is a gradient of health -- and this is what's called standardized mortality, basically your chances of dying.

We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. 
They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned," but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. 
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. 
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. 
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. 
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers. 
It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. 
(Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? 
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about — This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter) and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter) Okay? (Applause) So in that regard, this is one of the things, this is one of the privileges of being, and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way, when I told you that I'm the world's greatest, if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism 
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks, they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. 
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. 
This is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV, but smarter, faster, stronger.

Language is beautiful. 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. 
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world." 
First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. 
He died in 1974. 
(Laughter) Couldn't do it. Could not wait. 
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything. 
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner, where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns. 
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet. 
We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. 
I get it, knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so under-reported. 
And if you have one of these birds -- children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years. 
So just think about it. 
If you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs. 
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive. 
So, absolute figures, like the military budget, in a connected world, don't give you the whole picture. 
Did you know that today we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods? 
Now, Erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of Madagascar, but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar. 
They're about where you live, how many people you live with, and whether you own your home or not. 
The institutions are solemn, and so is the design. 
(Laughter) You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED. 
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? They can't see that stuff inside the tail. 
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. 
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. 
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful. 
I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for 13 consecutive assignments. 
For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S. 
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money, it won't satisfy me. 
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?" 
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. 
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website, but also grow myself?" 
I don't want to write that stuff." 
We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart, but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. 
And Perry's policy solution was to ask the people of Texas to pray for rain. 
You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies. 
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work. 
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself, that artists shouldn't say what they're up to, because if they said it, it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy. 
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. 
If you have the air in this room, you don't notice each individual atom. 
And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality. 
There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. 
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought. 
And this is the true triple bottom line, because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this. 
So, Maldives, beautiful place. 
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing. 
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. 
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations. 
What do the graphs look like? 
We've now done that procedure, and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases, so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus. 
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone, and you stopped making plans. 
Well a good place to start is with waste. 
So this was chapter one. 
And the answer is that he'll stay with us or won't stay with us inside us as wind, as air, as words. 
This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. 
In places like Denmark and Germany, they've maxed out on wind already. 
Remember Prickly Pear. 
(Laughter) I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring." 
I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet. 
And then, when you've amputated the arm, this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom, OK? 
Well, what about 10^22? 
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra, latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. 
And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this -- now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine. 
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center, which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. 
There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this. 
They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop. 
And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans, and this beautiful, spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me. 
The one up there can't divide at all. 
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto, which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right. 
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request. 
And there's a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. 
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned, and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other bi-algal products of interest. 
Take Copenhagen last year -- complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. 
For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect." 
And they've inspired many characters as well. 
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. 
But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us. 
It's on the bottom right corner there. 
You see, there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure, when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing, you were good at math, you could build things, you were an astronaut, an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau, you could jump higher, run faster, kick harder than anyone. 
I know this because I read in the New York Times, the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad after September 11, in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran, the problem in this country, facing this country is the university professors and their spawn." 
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times, because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either. 
In this example here, we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders, so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in. 
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots, so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight. 
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. 
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
It's asking people, what do they want. 
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. 
(Laughter) Another finding is that the unconscious, far from being dumb and sexualized, is actually quite smart. 
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. 
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible. 
A final example: Kosovo. 
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof, and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun. 
Finally, you go to the emergency room. 
So when we're talking about cutting government spending, this is the pie we're talking about, and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter what party they're in, overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk. 
They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gar's mouth, code, take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg, reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code. 
So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University, I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career. 
Some of them are smaller. 
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves. 
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. 
Here, he's bringing the sun out. 
But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks, where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon, with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on, and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. 
So our doctors said these are eye candies. 
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. 
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day, when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls, or when there's a power outage, and you have no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly, efficiently and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. 
(Laughter) So, this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft -- except one. 
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. 
Your cat wants more food. 
So it turned into a dual celebration, because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States. 
He's dying. 
Video games are not the cause. 
And what do you see here? 
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care. 
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, "You know what? 
What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people, billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people, and how little space there will be to fit all of them, so we need to change the way that we see cities, and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today, you can see how gray and brown it is. 
There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. 
It's humanity's DNA. 
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. 
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- but I did. 
Values are a certain kind of fact. 
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line. 
But I also don't understand how it does ruin the magic. 
We were in Queens, we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown, so we were in the small, small, small boondocks. 
But when he didn't win, when he lost, he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. 
Now, it actually gets better than this. 
You don't have millions and millions of dollars, but you can call your representatives, and you can remind them that you vote, and you can ask not to be treated like a thief, and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. 
And we did. And it was play. 
Fortunately, there is the evolution of culture. 
When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say, "Oh my God." Have you ever wondered what that meant? 
(Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. 
If you can't do that first step, are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy? 
An example is Tasmania. 
It alters our personalities. 
So, how did she know that she was right? 
When he was trading fours with me, improvising versus memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left. 
And so every year, I share my background with my kids, because they need to know that everyone has a story, everyone has a struggle, and everyone needs help along the way. 
When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. 
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. 
You need a pressure breathing system with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale. 
So we are trying different types of energy now, alternative energy, but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost-effective as oil, gas and coal. 
And it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues. 
Now when I look back, the transplant was actually the easiest part. 
It may be the next rainforest, in terms of pharmaceuticals. 
♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫ ♫ Maybe humming along ♫ ♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫ I'm a huge believer in hands-on education. 
But in order for me to explain what that is, I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. 
(Applause) All right. 
So, if you've been gone, this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay? 
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD. 
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise. 
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. 
What is raveling? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off. 
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here. 
Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies. 
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. 
In a way, I feel like my life is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made. 
It's not a street map." 
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with, and we actually got to do it twice. 
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father, my relatives, my friends and my homeland. 
And the fellow in the vest there, Craig Toten, he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. 
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about. 
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these. 
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt, anyway -- (Laughter) but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution, aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead. 
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour. 
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers. 
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting. 
Together, this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. 
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act. 
There are other questions that are tough. 
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals. 
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. 
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets -- otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway. 
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion, a strong force applied to the character, and have the character react to it in midair. 
Six weeks into his prison sentence, van Meegeren confessed. 
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes -- putting the kids on the bus in the morning, getting ourselves to work on time, surviving email overload and shop floor politics, foraging for groceries, throwing together meals, escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime-time TV or TED online, getting from one end of the day to the other, keeping out the giraffes. 
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. 
Music is entirely different. 
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff? 
So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. 
I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years. 
It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood of academic medicine. So in 1980, some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide, and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug, a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms, and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack, they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms, so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving. 
[Surgery] The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer. 
We certainly don't want to give up the rights, when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts. 
We'd seen that users had actually modified it. 
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea. 
What about a great depression? 
They were saying, Why's it moving? 
They have no concept of what it is that's involved. 
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things. 
What else is in this picture? 
Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson. 
My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry, and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out, and when my mother finally came out, she had our baby sister in one arm, a huge duffel bag in the other, and tears were streaming down both her cheeks. 
And how do you secure their privacy? 
It's the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history, and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet. 
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her? 
We want this golden world. 
MK: We're gun owners, we support gun rights. 
On average, as a Chinese in 1965, you lived 10 years more than an average Indian. 
They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally. 
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing. 
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God, who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. 
So how do you move these people around? 
(Applause) The theme of my talk today is, "Be an artist, right now." 
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens. 
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform? 
Is this the best we can do? 
I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York, I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college. 
This is crazy. 
It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. 
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. 
This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region. 
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering. 
Do I have to run? 
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. 
And so that's what we'll do today. 
If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK? 
And a year after that treatment, his tumor grew back with a vengeance. 
It was about 1960. 
They observed one another, from the youth, from the middle aged to the old. 
It was taking place in churches. 
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions. 
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice -- they accepted me. And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. 
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?" 
You view the bond in the triangle. 
There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident, or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star. 
He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. 
So how are they different? 
(Laughter) So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost. 
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am. 
But in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions of years. 
And then there was good design for very low price. 
We are wrapping up. 
That happens in the building industry as well. 
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself, pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other. 
(Applause) Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something, they are experts, they know what's going on. 
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri. 
Especially the good ones, not all of them. 
This research is funded by the public. 
Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. 
(Whistling) Her father the king said, "Don't whistle." 
What's the schedule, Richard? 
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. 
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen. 
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime. 
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously that "he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for." 
My mother was born in Sacramento, California. 
It is not the same pattern at two different scales. 
Liberation, however, costs some money. 
But in order to do this, one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. 
We know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve," there's a 99 percent match for cutting. 
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific. 
How? 
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active. 
The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace. 
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count, but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist, I was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. 
If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit, it was a really bad day on Mars. 
They didn't know why they didn't take me away. 
Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those who lost their lives, and those who gave their lives to help others, but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country, the love, the compassIon, the strength, and I watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy. 
So, at this point, Natasha doesn't speak a word of English, other than what little Father Keene taught her. 
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky. 
So we see it in religions and self-help books, that money can't buy happiness. 
But it's not one virus, it's four, and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three. 
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people, birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy, where the foliage is dense, their calls tend to be high-pitched, short and repetitive. 
The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice, I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master. 
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead, just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow, but the caption says he is dead." 
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really. 
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. 
When that mother and infant lock eyes, and the infant's old enough to have a social smile, what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother. 
Darwin's laws don't change, but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. 
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope, and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. 
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range. 
This is the most successful order on the planet by far. 
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon, and worse than that, burning one hectare of grassland gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants than 6,000 cars. 
And we had a sense that, as we operated within our organizations, it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations, particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know. 
Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people, and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running. 
Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net. 
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic, and, of course, my toaster had to have a plastic case. 
Well, if you can speak like writing, then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak. 
Now, I haven't met these particular students, but I've met students like them. 
And you could stuff pins in them. 
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. 
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back, find a way to a window. 
However, there has been a bit of politics going on, and the will to do it was not there, so it drifted to the right. 
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing, what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. 
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it. 
Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter) Because my favorite thing about her, other than, like, everything, is that she is very -- has always been unapologetically present on stage, and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them, and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks. 
Now, the idea of that at medical school -- this is a recurring theme, isn't it, me and medical school? — would have been ridiculous, but it's an absolute reality today. 
It still ends up at half a turn. 
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. 
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. 
There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that, and it's called verified auctions. 
And then on one day, August 28th of 1854, a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know, we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera, came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street. 
It may surprise you that it's not only climate. 
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi." 
You can see the coal burning plant in the background. 
Nature is nano. 
And that's really the spirit of my talk. 
In Lebanon, it was not a book. 
Yes, it's happening here. 
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me, "You know, we always thought there'd be time." 
You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23 from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out, but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need, and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes any more, even. So each child has 46 parents, and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. 
Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here. 
I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? 
And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated. 
And there's the Giving Pledge, in which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity. 
Do you have those conversations with people? 
This troubles me. 
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." 
There's never been an angel- or a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen. 
NT: They wouldn't give me the money. 
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China, nearly 70,000 people were killed, and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor. 
We, as a country, should be ashamed at that. 
And here are the dynein. They're carrying that broadcasting system. 
Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes, and then we'll be on an even more favorable long-term deficit trajectory? 
Now you might be thinking that citizens of high-tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war, that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable, particularly against developing nations. 
And you can see those in micrometeorites. 
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining? 
And here, again, we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. 
You see them on the mountains up there. 
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials. 
He's moved from London to New England, over in America. 
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand. 
So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn, glorified my school principal, put him right on top, and gifted it to him. 
And so some really nice things came together. 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change. 
She didn't speak to me for a very long time, because she thought I'd let my family down. 
Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself. 
There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. 
The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on. 
Count thy sheep and not thy years. 
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. 
And on the day I met my father for the first time, I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design, my one and only choice for college. 
You've been given one tool, a hammer. 
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. 
The theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies -- gobbledygook that we sell to Congress, because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. 
He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing, we have to reason about, and sometimes argue about, the purpose of the thing, or the social activity -- in this case, musical performance.

Now, of course, we care about the social value. 
In fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America, weed-out courses or barrier courses. 
And this is not a difficult problem to fix. 
In a sense, we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity. 
We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. 
The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. 
It was a very nice experience, and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked. 
We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. 
Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. 
Pretty straightforward really. 
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo, we discovered the super flare. 
I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future. 
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row. 
You go to and fro endlessly. 
So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts: swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets. 
I could have taken him to New York, and he would have died in a day. 
There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are. 
Many, many species depend on them. 
They were breathing those words with fractal lungs. 
Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. 
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today." 
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. 
No." (Laughter) "Christian principles, Christian values. 
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria, you're certainly not going to eradicate. 
Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat. 
Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like, and in the background, you can see Robben Island. 
The great point is to give them the plain facts." 
And I thought, surely, we do better than that. 
There are some very light people, some extremely heavy people, maybe people with a lot of bulk up top. 
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. 
The yellowfin was also heavily fished. 
And we compare simulated universes like that -- I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk -- with what we actually see in the sky. 
And let me immediately tell you here, when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita," good life, human life. 
It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem, and how we all are part of this problem. 
And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm. 
And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies, the babies also have the virus DNA in them. 
The Charter of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. 
Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. 
It's not just competitive, it's also caring. 
They were able to create that. 
(Applause) Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia. 
And I felt overwhelmed. 
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. 
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. 
And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. 
But some of the files were left behind intact, and activists, some of them, found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges, their cellphone text message exchanges, even Skype conversations. 
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out. 
There's problem after problem, and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems. 
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. 
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun. 
(Applause) The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago, we embarked, the government of the day embarked on a series of government-to-government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country. 
Do you think that's not going to happen? 
Now, why does this happen? 
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. 
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall. 
And the next one is really beautiful. 
Public space. 
(Laughter) Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set. 
I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. 
He wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there. 
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems. 
Charles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste, eat very often, particularly in southern India, they eat off of a banana leaf. 
Because our main goal, of course, is first, to do no harm. 
We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this. 
Her crossing the fragmented tiles, faltering at the step to the street, droning, not looking at me, "Can you help me?" 
He proudly said he played King Lear. 
Now, what is game theory about? 
But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox: this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh -- when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus, thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror. 
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform, that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different, perhaps something radically different. 
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity. 
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system, deploy it all across the frozen north, and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place. 
There was no day when humanity came together, separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we're in this together, and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated, then that might be the key to humanity's survival. 
And the reason is, after World War II, we changed our farming practices. 
This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now, at this point in history, to see art as a catalyst; what it means now, at this point in history, as we define and redefine culture, black culture specifically in my case, but culture generally. 
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you. 
It's amazing. 
Well that would be impossible and, rightly, illegal to do in humans. 
The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know -- Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. 
And in addition, I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life. 
I have further results, which are almost unbelievable, of scores which go up with time. 
We need to be able to talk to you out there, so that you can give the message of what's happening here." 
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman." 
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans. 
These things which make Islamic Law, the troubling aspects of Islamic Law, were later developed into later interpretations of Islam. 
Now, visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities. 
So he flies closer and he flashes again. 
And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking. 
He's a complete revolutionary. 
These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts. 
There I rose from my chair for good, I leaned on my cane, and I looked back, finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus to photographs of the crash, and when I saw this photograph, I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body. 
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors, move liquid through pipes. 
And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. 
And so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world, through video, through photos, through written history, and so people's experiences on that day, which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform. 
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. 
And the density is quite incredible. 
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey. 
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her. 
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one? 
He was trembling when our boat approached, frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. 
So I'm a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations that are based on numbers and facts, and I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just 16 light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. 
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid. 
And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome, we know everything about the sequence of the gene, the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene, But we know nothing, but nothing, about the language and alphabet of form. 
We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems: ecology, people and technology. 
But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want. 
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic. 
Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us. 
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. 
And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside, and make those compasses go crazy, always centering on them. 
And I said, "Well what makes it great?" 
I'll give you a moment to read through them. 
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. 
2030? By 2030, robots, not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it. 
And that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed. 
Like this. 
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. 
In short, they make cities better places to live. 
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud. 
Well, language, as a social interaction, has to satisfy two conditions. 
Thank you so much. 
Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart. 
And I flew it. 
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this. 
We can't see CO2 -- we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it -- but we can see pre-CO2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf. 
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out, have to reach out, beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. 
This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. 
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. 
So, it was possible to get enough food. 
And each time we have some ice in the future, we have to know that life will be great, and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice, to go through the obstacle, to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side. 
And it really changed the dynamic. 
And that leads me to the next term, which is "weird life." 
So the question is, we know how to hold government accountable. 
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this. 
You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another, and they support weight. 
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States -- I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America. 
♫ What's that blue thing doing here? ♫ ♫ Something grabbed ahold of my hand ♫ ♫ I didn't know what had my hand ♫ ♫ but that's when all my troubles began. ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I cannot understand you ♫ ♫ I cannot understand you ♫ ♫ I don't understand the things you say ♫ ♫ I can't understand a single word ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I just don't understand you ♫ ♫ I don't understand you ♫ ♫ I do not understand you ♫ 
Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation: that in your dim kitchen, your laundry, your bleak concrete yard, what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation; your real sensual nature, veiled in those sexless vestments, was utterly your dominion. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
OK, you can start the music, thanks. 
In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. 
Extremely effective, it really did -- somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. 
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. 
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul. 
As you move down the ladder of apartments, you see that they get worse and worse. 
And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. 
But very often several days later, the patient's gone home, we get a phone call: "I'm sorry, once we looked at the final pathology, once we looked at the final specimen, we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive. 
There's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it. 
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life, there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. 
And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed. 
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. 
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out is something that many economists overlook. 
And last summer, I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales. 
The future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. 
And in fact, we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this]. 
You start to get into detail. 
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind, can determine the result of a race or a game. 
The average age of gamers? 
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. 
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers, major websites. 
And then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand new park in New York City. 
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves, it becomes a movement. 
And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys. 
And I say, "Well, that's very complex, and we'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco-material means, because everything at some point comes from nature, and it's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact. 
Knowledge is power. 
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults. 
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper? 
It was obvious to me to do another work. 
Their job is to get things done, and if they don't, they're out of a job. 
It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward. 
These are the bits, the pleasure centers, and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking. 
So, integrity and passion: the single most important things out there. 
Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the -- excuse me, it's fairly blatant -- is really not the approach that we need to take. 
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop. 
And I learned something else, that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest in the country. 
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. 
We see high-end haggling in fashion today. 
And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. 
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear]. 
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this, other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes. 
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking, "we've figured it out by now." 
When oil was at stake, somehow, suddenly, things mattered. 
But of course, we can do better. 
But it takes some persistence. 
He was a very selfish meme. 
(Applause) Many of you could ask the question, you know, why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately, a roadable aircraft, possible at this time? 
I accepted enthusiastically, and a few weeks later, a package arrived containing not one, but two books -- Rafidah's choice from Malaysia, and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. 
We actually have the technology and systems. 
I actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology." 
That one on the right is about five feet high. 
That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. 
(Laughter) And they tried everything they could to get me out of there. 
They had to fit within the envelope. 
He entered the world through the three gateways that doom so many young American men: bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons. 
This is at 17,000 feet. 
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. 
The truth of social entropy. 
You can see the individual structures of the woman. 
During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides, and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old, we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq. 
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'" (Laughter) "You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before." 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. 
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. 
But, you know, in many parts of the world, governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. 
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?" 
It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City," or maybe watching funny videos of cats. 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. 
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. 
There is a small person right down there on the ground. 
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2) They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. 
E: Beer. 
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right. 
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. 
They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos. 
If you wanted 16 from wind, this map visualizes a solution for the U.K. It's got 160 wind farms, each 100 square kilometers in size, and that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind. 
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope, Darwin's 200th birthday, the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species," the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science, the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit, and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED. 
Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations. 
Thank you. 
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness." 
It's not saying that it's not a big problem. 
In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart; they're unique in the world. 
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. 
They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom. 
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." 
And the ones over there, they were so-called Western countries. 
They were these kind of weird things. 
So these are the kinds of layers, the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today -- the question of, What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you're designing something? 
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits, the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around. 
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars? 
And we will do other centers. 
Well, I stood up to her. 
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair. 
His name is Chris Farina. 
I get sick when I go to steakhouses. 
It connected those two people. 
Should it be 450? Should it be 400? 
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money, but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there. 
I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. 
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that, and that's using our eyes more. 
One of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there. 
Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally. 
It's not so simple. 
But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium. 
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon. 
So with that, you know, a couple game dynamics to talk about. 
A metamaterial is an artificial material, which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation, in a way that you couldn't otherwise. 
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale. 
You know, none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs, and they're not going down any time soon. 
Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country, get the most for the fish? 
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy, because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. 
When I was considering a career in the art world, I took a course in London, and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro, who drank too much, smoked too much and swore much too much. 
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. 
It's pacific, coordinated civil action, which doesn't mean passive action. 
Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain, it is not a theory. 
So one of the things thought of in the '80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event. 
(Laughter) (Applause) JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. 
He says something's just. She says something else is just. 
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard -- the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear, the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang. 
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing. 
So the real key question was, how do we empower this woman? 
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique. 
Somehow that doesn't seem right. 
Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was, and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative. 
(Laughter) Even when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake. 
Then she said, "Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity." 
And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. 
So the most common question I get asked, and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight, is how did this come about? 
But they also talk about the fact that their executives, all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. 
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well. 
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines and even used utensils, which you see on the autopsy table. 
Right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote. 
Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70, and offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue. 
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it. 
Now as I was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation, what we had instead, cascading through the regulatory network at the FDA, were these substances -- arsenic, thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas. 
I was nominated for a Grammy and I've won some awards and stuff like that, so that's awesome, but the best part was meeting my husband, and I've actually known Donnell for probably 12 years now, and I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess, how music brought us together, but I'm going to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5, Donnell Leahy. (Applause) (Applause) Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here, but I'm just trying to put it all together, trying to figure all you people out, and I've 
Katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things. 
Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. 
This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli. 
I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station. 
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family. 
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. 
That is a huge transformation. 
I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution. 
(Laughter) Because there seems to be an issue. 
Now let's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer -- these are the dollars invested per death -- and the dollars invested in lung cancer. 
And the education they got was pitiful. 
It's the child that's remembered. 
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother. 
Here he is. One little guy, black jeans and stuff, on a totally empty stage. 
The flowers are named after him, the mountains are carved with his slogans. 
I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. 
Here, in the nonsense range: "Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?" 
And it's shockingly not a new idea. 
He's working the leg. 
64 becomes 6,400. 
You understand a solar chimney. 
What we proposed, and what we've now generated support for, is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance. 
You know why? Because they didn't care. 
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp. 
That record exists on Mars. 
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. 
He screamed a lot. 
Where does such rage come from? 
And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?" 
So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. 
And after we failed, I just kept failing. 
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way. 
Take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology -- like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones, and so on. 
And the first of these is to connect, is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. 
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner. 
And what I'd like to do now, in an act of warp-speed storytelling, is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world. 
So I've seen life as one long learning process. 
You can draw ground water from any well. 
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo, but when he was based in London, he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops, and the game was as such: When we look at an antique we want, we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique, and if it's a good story, we'll buy it. 
So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge the status quo. 
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. 
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life, and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom, the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God, faith, but violence and crime and cruelty. 
We have to invest, in fact, in the idea of a meaningful prosperity, providing capabilities for people to flourish. 
So the question is: how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical? 
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree? 
So having that image of horror in your brain, seeing the void of death -- that analogue of horror which is hiding something -- will completely take over. 
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia. 
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us. 
I was a 24-year-old young engineer. 
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. 
You can't really directly sense the world around you. 
It also exists in more conventional game forms. 
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate, 3.1 percent when I calculated. 
And on the 3rd of July 2013, the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president, after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation. 
You know, think of the fast food industry, the drug industry, the banking industry. 
But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful. 
How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try? 
So, to conclude, intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries, and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year, while significantly reducing global energy consumption. 
We can't stifle innovation in our business. 
You have to say, well, blackness of skin, you couldn't suffer just for that. 
What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move. 
So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with? 
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. 
Superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals. 
It's a living relic of the distant past. 
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp. 
So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow, and lo and behold, we found them. 
Is there a general purpose technology of our era? 
I call a name that could be his. 
It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity. 
And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over? 
As our former Vice President said, we have to become activists. 
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible, more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. 
These fly autonomously. 
But if any of you people ask, "What actually goes up? Does anything go up? 
And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. 
And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve. 
The second, more honest way is to actually fix the model. 
It's like the Olympics of food products. 
This bottle of oil, distilled over a hundred million years of geological time, ancient sunlight, contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you. 
Thank you. 
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist, so what I'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like. 
Conductive ink has been used by artists, but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens. 
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened. 
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really, really risky. 
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond." 
I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore, and they're amazing people, and we want to deliver them to future generations. 
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around. 
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law, you have a problem. (Laughter) So, all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it's related to how we teach the children. 
I could get access to it. 
What happens with these one- and two-step types? 
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain, or in any other brain for that matter. 
It's now been FDA approved, and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. 
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock. 
They go out and test it against the evidence. 
So, given that kind of video input, with just about six or seven minutes worth of video, Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. 
(Applause) OK, this is the title of my talk today. 
Over the next few days, I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. 
So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the P25, and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in. 
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia; and Haynesville in Louisiana. 
It is now possible -- will be possible, and if Craig Venter indeed comes today, he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year. 
Here's an example of a project using the microphone. 
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. 
The students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games like Pong, Snake and Tetris. 
That's the first problem. 
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician, I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says. 
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles. 
That's greater than one percent of the global GDP. 
It could have survived 150 years of whaling. 
We got there first. 
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend," from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan. 
She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. 
It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. 
(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon? 
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. 
And so we actually went in. 
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering, and American drops into eighth. 
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak. 
You know, they were marginalized in the negotiation room. 
would be this. 
All I could think about was running back up to the door, banging on the door, and saying, "Look guys, I haven't quite thought this through." 
Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team. 
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well. 
And this man, Terry Jones: I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Korans, right? 
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control. 
All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies, and that has a radical implication for our security, because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities. 
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. 
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone, but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition, extremely uncomfortable. 
(Laughter) I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong. 
I'm telling you this story because Archie Cochrane, all his life, fought against a terrible affliction, and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies. 
That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications. 
When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies, taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus. 
We don't notice and therefore we don't act. 
And we captured all that data all over again. 
We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthesis, to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. 
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet. 
So every month there are new graphics cards coming out, and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors -- NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well. 
They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. 
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad. 
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there, was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. 
We're going to talk about that some more. 
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course, but after the concert she came up and she said, "David, I've got to tell you something. 
It all began with a fantastic phone call. 
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue." 
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?" 
And while we were doing all this investigation, we got to know Mouaz's story. 
Why do they call it that? 
They're just practicing. 
So here are pictures of myself. 
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. 
(Laughter) And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall, or when the audience had to hush up, because you can now hear every single detail. 
The thing that really amazes me is that, today, people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games. 
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 -- 607, rather. 
One hundred fifty-two million phones were thrown out in the U.S. last year; only 11 percent were recycled. 
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. 
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer. 
You can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read something in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity in one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other. 
They're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out. 
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable. 
But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred. 
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. 
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. 
The village became a real standout. 
They're cutting down on deforestation, and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible, infinite and free at the point of production. 
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah. 
So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever. 
All of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement. 
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology, helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster, more cheaply and more effectively. 
You need to somehow find the fitness function. 
I'm not asking them to copy exactly. 
It is the G8 Summit. 
They are properties of the fundamental law. 
Let's get creative against climate change. 
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser. 
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you. 
There is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels. 
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. 
I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. 
If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. 
China is soon to pass the U.S. 
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata, and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that. 
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West. 
And then another six can be made robustly, competitively, from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel, without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. 
Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. 
So this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress, and this is what our last forecast was based on. 
OK. 
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen. 
And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough. 
(Applause) Here we can get more green energy all over. 
And if compassion is so good for us, why don't we vote on compassion? 
When extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food. 
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep, and on the right it's gentle. 
And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything. 
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself, and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra." 
And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head, but I couldn't see them because of my hair. 
If we add the matrix, if we add the structure language, which we have to learn, when we learn it, then we can put it back; and around energy, we could generate a balance, which comes out from our really primordial operation: cooking. 
These blocks represent LEDs. 
But it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf. 
If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal. 
Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here, but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober, disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side, has to conclude, based on the data, that with those kinds of economic forces at play, there is definitely going to be a sea change, and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being, and our identities, as well. 
The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities, and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation. 
In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. 
I want to prevent this shit from happening. 
Here's the key question. 
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy. 
And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. 
At all times, Wikipedia is approximately 45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right? 
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center, and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. 
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster. 
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. 
I want you do something else. 
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. 
(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean? 
Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the -- Audience: Supremes! 
If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible, we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. 
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible. 
You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet. 
So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place, and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. 
We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. 
If you ask, what is the big difference between women and men physiologically? 
CA: Mark, 30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said. 
This is a viper from Brazil, the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de São Paulo here. 
Look in your own backyard. 
And as a musician and composer, when I hear that word, something like this is floating through my mind. 
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally. 
These invisible links that allure, these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us. 
You can follow it through the fossil record. 
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful, obviously. 
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in New England. 
One is, for instance, technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of 4.2 million years. 
That's bad, but there are places like that. 
So listen to how I sound. 
The idea is like this. 
That this is our only home. 
And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement. 
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. 
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. 
So what we did was design a couple of arenas. 
But I have a problem with that belief, because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems. 
But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'" So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. 
And it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my DNA. 
So, we have all these words, and we really need help! 
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions. 
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans. 
We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. 
See, our pattern detection device, which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex -- it's our little detection device there -- can be easily fooled, and this is the problem. 
So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art. 
And the oceans are hugely productive, as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis, the production of new life. 
But crucially, the area that's ringed red highlights an area that is pale blue. 
Of course, my son is learning from his linguistic environment, but the environment is learning from him. 
More. 
But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this, which is great relative to the utopian idea. 
And there was a building, a new building, going up, that was being built right outside, across the street from our hotel. 
She said that when she just ran it across the table, it felt like her finger was rocking. 
It's a journalism studio in São Paulo downtown, where I used livestream to experiment with what I call post-television formats. 
Mice, of course, are the quintessential model organism. 
Well, we just show the website instead, for all that time, as a filler, and we became very famous in Iceland, went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. 
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria. 
He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement. 
In fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying, What would happen if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News? 
PM: There have been 11 mass shootings since Newtown, a school a week in the first two months of last year. 
That plus nukes rules out great power war. 
And in the year 1970, it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians. 
But are conservatives happy about this? 
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer. 
And can we really do better than these primitive, small-brained ancestors? 
(Laughter) So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit." 
The orange slice is what's discretionary. 
I merely have a holiday in psychology, and what interests me in general is moral debate. 
But not in a way that you want to stop. 
They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents, and they personalize learning opportunities. 
So we need to find smarter, more systems-based, innovative solutions to these problems, if we're going to start to live sustainably within this world. 
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week. 
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like. 
Instead, everything we touched we killed. 
Align it in this direction. 
It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this; it's us. 
(Laughter) But the theme of this session, of course, is invention. 
Why has it been rising since the '70s? 
Don't I wish. 
The second is for continued population, human population expansion. 
Sex! 
They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love. 
Granted, we have a long way to go. 
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push. The probe would just shoot away. 
And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain, and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code. And when I say code, I do literally mean code. 
Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at, the ones that we love. 
But this is just a single neuron. 
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it ♫ ♫ very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫ ♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫ 
My ability and my potential. 
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail]. 
And the two divine people fought, and the gods were on the side of divinity. 
And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence: "Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse." 
You know, maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. 
But despite our verbal assurances, they wanted some proof. 
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself. 
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote, via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course. 
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. 
It never stops coming. 
As a result of the human genome process, we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean -- like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort -- can actually be sampled. 
And you don't know what the future will hold, but it's not going to get a lower percentage. 
SM: So what's happening here? 
And al-jebr roughly translates to "the system for reconciling disparate parts." 
Heart disease, cancer, a car accident? 
We tested a lot of specimens there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that." 
So there's versatility, as you see, in the material formats, that you can do with silk. 
So then I went the whole American way, with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed, but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way. 
Now, my dad's doing better today, and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer. 
This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. 
You see, our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison, which is about destroying our systems and our ways. 
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key, artists, at long last, take their place at the table, when strategies of action are in the process of being designed. 
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter. 
I think in some ways, the reason I started the project, even though I didn't know it at the time, was because I was struggling with my own secrets. 
And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. 
I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, "Why would you do it? 
So in a lecture-based class, half the students are above that level and half are below. 
But look at the arrows. 
(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.) DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle. 
And this is a perfect square, and it's divided into 14 bits. 
A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology, is that adopted siblings reared together -- the mirror image of identical twins reared apart, they share their parents, their home, their neighborhood, don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all. 
(Laughter) So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. 
This region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence. 
So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart coming out by radio telemetry. 
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. 
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. 
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws. 
Still, America had gone saucer-mad, even famous scientists who were eating lunch. 
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. 
And then you know what we do? We negotiate. 
The secular world is full of holes. 
And this goes on for thousands of years, because these are hard questions, and I've only got 15 minutes. 
The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine." 
What's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks? 
And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum. 
Think of the children on the slow side of the class. 
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today. 
Women in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same age, perhaps a necessity for dating. 
(Laughter) (Applause) (Video) Man: How are you doing? 
I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games. 
So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on. 
But you might ask, well so what in any case? 
So what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel, is the way I see it. 
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking, "Oh boy, I'm on totally the wrong track here. 
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. 
In the words of the Savage, regaining autonomy and freedom is possible, although the price to pay is steep. 
One goes extinct for the other to survive. 
They could have said, "This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet." 
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients. 
You're offering to put me in hospitals? 
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife, wildlife numbers started coming back, and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia. 
And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt. 
In fact, those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent, will note that this is a semi-log plot. 
The mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one. 
I was also interested in the physicality of this format, because you have to walk to see it. 
I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time, and I'm really excited that it's here now, because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work, and I'd like to show it. 
There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin, and they all lived in this refrigerator city, and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up, an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple, and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter. (Laughter) And I'd make my own comics too, and this was another way for me to tell stories, through words and through pictures. 
You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular. 
And so that's led to a question for me: Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy? 
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool. 
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little, initial website that we started off with. 
I started crying. 
And on our third high-speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York, we got to do that for the first time. 
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually. 
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. 
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem, it's easy to study on plants, for example, than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. 
Thank you. 
You see? But the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too. 
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like Rachel Carson and others have warned. 
First of all, I'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see. 
So, somehow, for nearly two million years, we are killing animals without any weapons. 
When we compare those hundred years of video, we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. 
The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics, and this is a system that is embodied by China. 
And this is all a physical simulation of the body, using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body. 
I started a group called Open Source Ecology. 
The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice, so he throws himself off and kills himself, and Tom, Dick and Harry follow. 
I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer. 
And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude. 
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready. 
The origins of technology was not in 1829, but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang, and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot, and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all. 
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages. 
Should I skip that part? 
(Laughter) I was afraid of womanhood. 
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one. 
Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with. 
He wrote many, many times statements to this effect: "we have the right to kill four million Americans, two million of whom should be children." 
It's cells and it's wires all wired together. 
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows? 
These are -- 10 companies control much of what's in our grocery stores, much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem. 
The data came back from the United States, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and it was all the same: no correlation, no connection, none at all. 
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. 
So, this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. 
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit, and, yes, we have to think about the long term, because we will get hit again. 
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. 
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals. 
But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money. 
Today, we're using small quads. 
The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of "them," a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption. 
by which this might happen. 
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis. 
In this case, the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space, and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. 
(Laughter) You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it. 
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter. 
My hair's clean -- it's okay. 
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?" 
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. 
Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. 
And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life, Ed Wilson's TED wish. 
It's about every country. 
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money, not only on wine but on lots of things, and are they living a better life than me? 
It's happening all over the world. 
All of this is wrong. 
Those are conveyor belts that go around. 
The farm's incredible. 
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk. 
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus. 
I have a website -- it's a directory -- and it started with about 1,200 companies, and in the last two-and-a-half months it's up to about 3,300 companies. 
If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies, the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation. 
We were calling collectively for actions, and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know. 
So now look at the different lens. 
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. 
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. 
being a victim of hacking for a change. 
You can see that just from the map alone. 
Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. 
For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems in 1400 A.D. 
Everybody wins. 
This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web. 
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes, which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards, and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. 
(Laughter) Now, I put the laser here, and -- now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but -- yes? 
This was a golden age of bipartisanship, at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems. 
So we went over into Michael's garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there, and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe, drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers, pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there, and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage. 
We've all experienced this. 
How many of us flew here? 
Because they're not sure, and they don't want to take legal responsibility. 
So thank you very much. 
Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. 
They were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes. 
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day. 
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling; it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. 
Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all. 
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500, but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers. 
Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century, maybe for a couple of days, in some cases for more than a week, electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars, and a charge for their iPhones. 
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says, "If something exists, it must be possible." 
But here's a scary one: Divorce is contagious. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
But I want to show you a different approach, and this is this robot over here, which has four legs. 
Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair. 
(Applause) As a boy, I loved cars. 
But let's go back to safety, because everybody after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear, and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe, and I'm really excited about this reactor for essentially two reasons. 
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility. 
But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple, in the sense that it is completely reliable. 
But I'm really hopeful. 
And if we had Redwood-like biology, we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were. 
JA: I'm not sure about the incident. 
And then we took this data. 
Okay. That's Lesterland. 
Now imagine that women are represented here, and men are represented here. 
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it. 
And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? 
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site. 
I finally got to taste it before I left. 
You get up, it flushes by itself. 
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. 
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different. 
(Laughter) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. 
And earlier this year, there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money. 
Or they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry -- and often both -- and sprint off for a drink and some food. 
And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. 
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One. 
Therefore, it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one. 
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking. 
If we can get the audio up? 
Now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated. 
Could somebody put this guy up? 
(Laughter) Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. 
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding. 
And by "regretted it," I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side -- and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street. 
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry. 
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. 
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories. 
(Applause) So, this is really where design is able to create a conversation. 
And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they're all looking at me like, OK, we know who's not going to win this race. 
And of course, eventually things settled down. 
She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think. 
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea. 
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks. 
Okay. So this is my next project. 
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter. 
Quite often queues happen at the tolls. 
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention. 
(Laughter) Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years. 
Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way, depending on how the wind is blowing, can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour. 
We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar. 
And that layer is actually normally very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone, and it's got stem cells in it. 
What if there are truths about justice, and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated, partook of that form of justice? 
We have interviews, we have surveys. 
Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. 
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam. 
Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization? 
These kinds of things. 
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends -- the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing -- how to invest in women, how to empower them, how to save them. 
They've just instituted dynamic pricing. 
Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast? 
Use your other hand to apply the force back down. 
That is the resource that I'm talking about. 
And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses, "I'm not going to leave you." 
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention. 
So the idea is that the hardware, the software, the design of the object, the fabrication, everything about this project is open-source and you can make it yourself. 
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else. 
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. 
And by doing that, he's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour. 
When out on the water, it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. 
They have a material culture, a social culture. 
But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. 
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. 
What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life, whether it's your work life or your business life? 
She's in the studio with him for a long time. 
What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. 
It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice. 
What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality, and that's not a good thing. 
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. 
Let me end with just one more example. 
And I think when you're authentic, you end up following your heart, and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. 
I was in charge of the four-year-olds, which is good, because four-year-olds can't play sports, and neither can I. 
We started with the prescription pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibiotics, an inhaler, medication -- but what do patients need to be healthy, to not get sick in the first place? 
Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind. 
If you have the right team around you, the right tools, the right technology, and if you have enough self-belief and enough determination, then anything is possible. 
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark. 
And as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose, we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing. 
That has been the most exciting thing, not the technology, not the things people have done with it, but actually the community, the spirit of all these people getting together, sending the emails. 
So, this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror, and our own life. 
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. 
For example, Dubai -- cool place. 
In the summer of 1950, Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder, went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question: "Where is everybody?" 
It's available for everyone to do, and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now. 
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge. 
The bottom picture is Hitler youth. 
And here is the last bit. 
Then, when that gave out, I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those. 
We like it. We like some parts of it. 
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch, despite distance, and in real time. 
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today? 
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy. 
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. 
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students. 
And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. 
This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company. 
Now our responsibility is to push that edge. 
And every now and then, find a friend, find a turtle, and take a long, slow walk. 
Well, the murmuration functions to record a number of principles, and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. 
We've started to ask the question: Can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive? 
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information. 
We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells, the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse. 
Mosquitos. I hate them. 
What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. 
There are thousands of suppliers in there." 
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen, the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott. 
Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. 
It's very hard work to make tofu. 
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy. 
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months, who was going to graduate from high school, based on who had good attachment with mom. 
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. 
Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. 
I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle. 
He picks up a spoon, picks it up, scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk, holds the spoon level as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously, to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk. 
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost. 
And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason, but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. 
Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots? 
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn't really tell you very much. 
Initially these holes were lone blemishes, and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated. 
Actually, all we've got to do is explain the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain, and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained. 
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together. 
(Applause) Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting, in doing this, we had to sit together with the companies. 
It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. 
So let me stretch out that equation. 
They do things in small chunks. 
Last year on climate, for example, we had the highest global emissions ever. 
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field. 
And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. 
Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers, where you have HTML5 audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. 
So what's not to like? 
So, here is -- here is a couple pieces. Move them together, and now this is an active piece. 
The amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for 30 years. Thirty years. 
No fighting, ladies. 
Interesting problem. 
It became part of me. 
That's the basis for the Western model of representative government. 
So when you first get them, they're babies. 
But we are crazy. We do these things. 
We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness. 
Thank you. (Applause) For the last 15 years that I have been performing, all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world. 
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs. 
["Academy Award Winner for Visual Effects"] Second doctor: Welcome to your new body, Jake.First doctor: Good. 
So making a living is not that easy for young people. 
Very useful word. So, look at that. 
He had never committed a crime before. 
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild. 
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities. 
So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. 
Here's what the friend said: "Well, what do you expect? 
There's a limb prosthetic up here, similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq. 
And it doesn't just stay on the screen. 
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics, along with her, of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships. 
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials. 
We're going to know at year end if that is true. 
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi, which I think is a great name. 
So imagine if you designed kettles, you actually found a way to solve these system failures, because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system, just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world. 
The boys call me faggot." 
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem, because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. 
RB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. 
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid, and then excavate the sand, and we have our architecture. 
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. 
Here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages. 
And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers. 
So the pieces are, not only the training of the lawyers, but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel, because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured. 
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests. 
You get books out of the machines, children's books. 
They were the Siemenses of this world, coming from France, from the UK, from Japan, from Canada, from Germany, and they were systematically driven by systematic, large-scale corruption. 
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500 out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something. 
Now we have, all over the world, women are called "bossy." There is a word for "bossy," for little girls, in every language there's one. 
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. 
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray. 
And the concept is to create a kind of onion, a kind of structure in layers. 
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. 
Search out the companies that are acting on this. 
Anybody else out there? Come on in. 
(Laughter) And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station, our condition was that we would work with them and that, whatever we did, we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. 
Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. 
(Laughter) Very mean-looking people, black clothes, black turban, and they pour into my office. 
That's a lot of light. 
You're missing not only these muscles, but your hand and your elbow too. 
(Applause) I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. 
You do feel a sense of exposure. 
(Applause) You will understand nothing with my type of English. 
I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. 
But nevertheless, my level of motivation still didn't change before he died. 
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense, in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion. 
And it'll be another six billion before that happens, and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. 
How should we view the Bible? 
So this is a timely problem. 
There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. 
You operate the world as you operate the real world, which is to say, with your hands. 
They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds. 
There were no lips. 
You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. 
These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line. 
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. 
Plank number two: Empower your children. 
There's a staggering array of wonders out there, across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing: success can be ours if we're willing to try. 
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. 
Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. 
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ... 
Biomass, to get 16 light bulbs per person, you'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth, either in our country, or in someone else's country, possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else. (Laughter) And a fourth supply side option, concentrating solar power in other people's deserts, if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs' worth, then we're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right. 
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact. 
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that. 
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. 
DE: This is "My Eagle Song." 
JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time. 
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting. 
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said, "The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once." 
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes. 
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. 
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. 
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. 
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we? 
They're cell-oriented. 
My story is a little bit complicated. 
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions. 
So we could think of adding on different, new sensory capacities and mental faculties. 
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos. 
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. 
(Laughter) The key phrase is "was," phew. 
How long did it take to go from one system to the next? 
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing; 9 to 10: future thinking. 
It's not going to happen, I don't think. 
But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open and there's a chance." 
But 18 months later, I asked him why he had tried to shoot me. 
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. 
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other." 
I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. 
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers. 
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. 
However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies, and its continued growth, its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues, leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself. 
I think this is the neatest-looking thing. 
This is the time to swim with real humility. 
Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day, and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs, which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it, and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. 
And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. 
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it, to get to the health care center. 
So their little wedding video went on to get over 40 million views. 
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums, having them participate in decision making, it's actually great. 
I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma. 
UNICEF thinks that that's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from 12 million in 1990. That is good. 
So I stopped the car and I went to help. 
But the problem is, we need more and more support for these ideas and cases. 
(Sound of metal lid clanking against a counter) (Clanking ends) And it stopped me cold. 
PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off! 
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election, who was the number one, active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech? 
And so inevitably, you would transform yourself -- irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration. 
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band. 
They found nothing. 
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same: like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension. 
Well, he compartmentalizes his life. 
And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. 
This article's about how their lives get ruined. 
As you get older, the risers get shallower and the steps get wider, and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries. 
I can love escalopes. 
As to the any danger exclusive of pain, the danger, if any, much consist in the tendency of the example. 
A little bit like on this picture here. 
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been. 
But these are numbers, and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are, where they came from, or why they're here. 
One of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups. 
And at some point he's dancing with his -- and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. 
Saving more today is not an option. 
Even the pencil. 
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet. 
And I'm going to leave you with that. 
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time. 
So, because it went into mass production, costs were reduced, 100 years of refinement, emissions were reduced, tremendous production value. 
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. 
Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it. 
It's a bee that, yes, flies. 
By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours, all victories for human-computer symbiosis. 
And I say, because ... because. 
And this is simply an appointment dynamic. 
The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species, the unconscious mind does most of the work. 
Because somewhere along the way, sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't succeed, and they believed it. 
(Applause) I love a great mystery, and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science, perhaps because it's personal. 
SP: But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war. 
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now. 
How do we do that? 
And to make them really stereotypical, let's make them both white guys. 
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. 
Well in the end, what we can also do: we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. 
The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms. 
But there are also glimmers of hope, and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. 
Derek Sivers invented CD Baby, which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man -- to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other. 
Paul Piff: Okay, so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. 
You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. 
We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined: inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge, recognizing and working with our fear, using anger as a fuel, cooperating with others, banding together with others, courage, and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence. 
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me. 
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them? 
(Laughter) But why is it so hard to slow down? 
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. 
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length. 
The problem may be relatively small; for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread? 
I am that refugee, and I am that girl. 
MM: The day is here. Life will change. 
Five factorial is 120. 
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. 
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars that are parked across France and 6,000 people who are members and eager to drive them. 
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing. 
Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. 
It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks, I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. 
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? 
That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. 
Some say bigger. 
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent of the global Brazil-nut market. 
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth. 
And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America. 
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later, like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time, and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase in the speed is constant. 
If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel, they would probably say, "This is worth the risk," because they could no longer see any other option. 
You can move inside, have different types of experiences. 
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles. 
Now, the remembering self is a storyteller. 
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years -- that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged? 
The authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car, and listening in on the car while tracking it via GPS on a map, and so that's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening. 
And to this day, I am ambivalent, but when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt. 
For the rocketeers in the audience: I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts, I admire the courage -- but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. 
This is my big vision. 
They weren't willing to engage in this. 
It is as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones. 
For example, a friend of mine. 
So, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T occurring in simplicity and complexity. 
Start with gene sequencing. 
But when we dare to break that silence, or when we dare to see, and we create conflict, we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking. 
What about longevity? 
You know my example of the Eurostar. 
Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world? 
And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on. 
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book, maybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community. 
And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing, then we're going to have a scream bag next year. 
I said, "I know someone you ought to meet. 
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago, a resource-rich, small Caribbean country, and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth, and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices. 
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators. 
It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife. 
(Laughter) And I remember it as a true moment of happiness. 
And we looked at, from the 1950s on, there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing. 
Thank you. (Applause) I've got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction, an arrow; that in some fundamental sense, it's good; that the arrow points to something positive. 
In the years following, the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. 
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways. 
And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter, I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table, and I pick it up, and I look at the headline across the top, and it says, "America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?" 
And what is it that we do that no other animal does, and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large, largest number of neurons in the cortex? 
And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year. 
We opened women's learning center. 
Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. 
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies. 
And so she watched this TED Talk, and she went back the next day, she took the job, she went home, and she handed her husband the grocery list. (Laughter) And she said, I can do this. 
(Applause) Okay, what is this object? 
And almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both. 
During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. 
(Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever. 
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall. 
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day. 
These machines that came out -- they started coming in the 1970s -- they would scan human bodies, and they would generate about 100 images of the human body. 
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. 
See that again. 
We are living on average today 34 years longer than our great-grandparents did. 
You could find the nodes, though, and then you went, and you go, "Right, I've got to investigate these people. 
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing. 
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so it was a lot harder to find. 
That was a decision based on love and responsibility. 
And even 20 years later, there was only 10 lawyers in the country, so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys, you'd meet women and you'd say, "Why are you here?" Women would say, "Well I've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him." 
It isn't always quite that simple, but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. 
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored? 
He said, "Well what are you doing?" 
We are fighting against this. 
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes -- charters, private schools, vouchers -- but we've had disappointing results year after year. 
I personally preferred the Spanish version, which was "Tortugas Ninja." 
I wanted to support them. 
And, you know, it happens for several reasons. 
ELA: So culturomics is what we call this method. 
We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. 
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning. 
It scales in the same way everywhere. 
All right. "Starsky and Hutch," arguably, yes. 
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf, and on the middle, cotton leaf, and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. 
And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. 
And of course all the data is inside, so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles, and I can see that this woman had a problem. 
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television. 
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking. 
Of course you're going to think this. 
Well, beforehand, everything is the same. 
But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided, "Why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve?" 
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. 
It allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story, and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story, and that's when we saw Modernism emerge, and we saw painting go into different branches. 
And if we can resist this crazy slogan, we shall discover -- in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya, and anywhere else we go in the world -- that if we can often do much less than we pretend, we can do much more than we fear. 
It's a non-spiking cell. 
Harvest baby teeth. 
We don't know what any of these symbols mean. 
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. 
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. 
Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom. 
And I am a role model in Yemen. 
One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day, he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?" 
I'm going to call it wonder. 
This is going to happen when hell freezes over. 
Further to the right means richer. 
First, a burial suit infused with mushroom spores, the Mushroom Death Suit. 
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs, Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed, and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain. 
It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. 
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. 
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. 
I was so upset. 
Should those be in the new package of goals? 
(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico. 
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent, which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. 
(Laughter) But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. 
Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons. 
So we tested all that, and in the end, he said, clearly people can be altruistic. 
And again, we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower. 
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years. 
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at, and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter). 
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts. 
Busy, busy work. 
They have been compared to astronauts -- these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. 
And vice versa, the best care often turns out to be the least expensive -- has fewer complications, the people get more efficient at what they do. 
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat. 
This is another painting. 
It attracted 42,000 people, and we showcased 51 films. 
And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see. 
Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher and he's still a dear friend of mine, and I was 14 or 15, and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course, and I was so excited, I was beaming. 
Now -- (Laughter) -- logic, logically, you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist. 
The more computers, the stronger the signal, and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together, tasks together. 
The photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison who wrote a book called "James &amp; Other Apes." 
And so they hire personal trainers; they're popping Cialis like breath mints. 
And: You’re completely wrong, and I’m sure you’re completely wrong. 
E: Happy birthday to you. 
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full-time job. 
At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache, but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life, and their lives are being totally ruined by it. 
This has literally revolutionized cognitive science. 
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all, and we're going to do a very high-res digitization, first because it's a way of preserving them. 
Because, if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this, the facts, not the myths, you may have policies which are very dangerous. 
And she turned to him and said, "Is that our cat?" 
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. 
And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that. 
So the NGOs become part of a public government system, rather than independent of it. 
We all love chocolate. 
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
And finally a mind-wandering question: Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing? 
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta, and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta, and this is happening right now. 
You see the canal they dug? 
But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient. 
And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again." 
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is, what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular, to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us. 
And what are their options? 
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe. 
But is it really that easy? 
What you're looking at -- (Applause) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye, and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there, I am going through the z-axis. 
This is one of my favorite features, this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line, running through a canopy of trees. 
Let's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts. 
Does anyone want to guess what it is? 
There's not really a lot of community support around it. 
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group, cheating went up. 
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before. 
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other. 
The holy man, Black Elk, said, "I did not know then how much was ended. 
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it." 
So the yellow bar represents car seats, the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts. 
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected. 
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone? 
He was not a schoolteacher. 
And you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work. 
It's crazy. 
I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries. 
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building, but he went to Cuba. 
Fashion, whether you like it or not, helps you project who you are to the world. 
(Applause) "When the crisis came, the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent." 
I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under. 
And with knowing comes caring. 
And if we could do it in Afghanistan, I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world. 
We have access to it all. 
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity, that recycle much of their water, that are much more comfortable than standard buildings, use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less. 
She was born one second after midnight in 1946. 
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain." 
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike, and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation, so in the respect that children, if they would like to read, you just take this incentive away in just paying them, so it just changes behavior. 
It's all just soda. That's just one choice." 
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years, if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me." 
The poet Frank O'Hara said, "If you don't need poetry, bully for you," but he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore, the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems had stopped him. 
And I understand. 
I want to live in a good country, and I so, so hope that you do too. 
(Beatboxing) NP: I remember that. 
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life. 
But I decided then to just give it a try. 
A baby first identifies its father through language. 
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. 
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. 
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings. 
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. 
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles, but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state, people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone." 
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything. 
But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed. 
In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003, and there are similar statistics all over the world. 
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker, and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance. 
My high school is Chicago, diverse and segregated on purpose. 
But our fantasies of substitution have cost us. 
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813, the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts. 
The intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know, in the example of the nose to the face, there's a fractional part-to-whole idea. 
And I said, "Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them, to see if you approve of them. 
And so we can feel unfinished. 
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it. 
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour. 
I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950. 
(Applause) I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects. 
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant, they don't seem to be able to figure out, "Do I have a training people issue? 
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. 
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow, and I was really tasked with setting this up. 
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. 
One of the other predictions of string theory -- no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory. 
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago, but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be, and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine, it's not likely to happen. 
But my parents -- I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. 
I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces, anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. 
And I told him, "Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country." 
I call them the Net Generation. 
In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out. 
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. 
The flux of its lava cleared all in its path. 
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. 
Green and gloomy eyes In dark forms of the grass Run away. 
Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go. 
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. 
First, within each video, the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous, but then integrating that with the best human engineering, ultimately to make something actually better than nature. 
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. 
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And "God"? 
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation, we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops. 
But the concept held true -- people working with people to rebuild me; people working with people to re-educate me. 
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. 
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple, honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis, with the government not keeping one dime. 
This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. 
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me. 
Let's take a look. 
In an even more radical stance against consumerism, the company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket" advertisement during the peak of shopping season. 
In short, we admire their willingness to play. 
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. 
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency. 
And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little. 
(Laughter) But of course, that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism, not here in the suburbs of Cleveland. 
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. 
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist, which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person, and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that. 
And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems. 
And the Russians, equally. 
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. 
This really changed how we perceived Twitter. 
So now, my friends, if that is true, and it is true, what is the point?" 
I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month, I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles -- very attractive. 
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- I used iPods as a material. 
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind. 
And the two species actually form temporary alliances when they're chasing sharks away. 
Place cells are also being recorded in humans. 
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment, and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas. 
CA: But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan? 
And skiing along that first trip, I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going. 
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly. 
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived. 
She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died. 
And oh, by the way, we've since quadrupled that, but -- (Applause) -- Please. 
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads. 
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images. 
And the reason is that cancer, like every cell in the body, places little molecular bookmarks, little Post-it notes, that remind the cell "I'm cancer; I should keep growing." 
It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash. 
(Laughter) Now, there's another way to do it, and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior, but the way that we're operating right now, that would require a tremendous change in behavior, and like an addict trying to kick a habit, the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. 
There's another one about personal health and nutrition. 
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted. 
You just press it. 
But the actual sub-adult at 65 percent had no crest at all. 
Here's another example from another piece, and then its realization. 
And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt, to draw down our own savings even further, just so that we can get the show back on the road, so we can keep this growth-based economy going. 
And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. 
And so they had to cram the sign. 
Now this may seem a bit ambitious, but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands, you realize that you're alive. 
They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use. 
Even when the information is terrible, the visual can be quite beautiful. 
This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos. 
It's kind of like a whole built town. 
On the way back down to the coast, our crampons — they're the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier — broke on the top of the Beardmore. 
Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee. 
They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero-emission cars. 
They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card, so it's completely open architecture. 
This was like a biological desert. 
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity. 
It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy. 
Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers. 
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time. 
Now we've switched to critical mass. 
BR: And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear, we really have something that looks, tastes and behaves like the real thing. 
Can you imagine going online -- this is a reality -- and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information, that data, and having the product made for you at home, ready to use, on your demand? 
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot. 
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true. 
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. 
So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate, and underneath that plate, there is a magnet. 
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger. 
The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature. 
We want a better way. 
And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed. 
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place." 
Now these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner, and at that dinner, you kind of get to know each other, sort of like what we're doing here. 
If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world? 
But perhaps, for me as a chemist, I want to keep away from general terms; I want to think about specifics. 
This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights, but the rights that were already written by these people -- these elitists, if you will. 
The first step is attention training. 
We're learning how to become like them. 
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom, a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth. 
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday. 
Not only can we think, we must. 
And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention. 
They live about seven good years longer than the average American. 
They didn't think that that was going to work there. 
But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. 
You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth. 
It's a primitive form of abstraction, and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain, because when that's damaged, these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki, but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor. 
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient. 
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy! 
Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like. 
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. 
Richard Saul Wurman: Really? 
He started making rubber stamps. 
It's also used, Arduino's used, in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider. 
So to get mobility without oil, to phase out the oil, we can get efficient and then switch fuels. 
No ocean, no life support system. 
Mentoring me. He'd come up and spend hours and hours with me. 
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. 
(Applause) There it is. 
My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact. 
And we just went out and looked at other people's collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth. 
Today, not so much. 
But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like, why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years. 
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations, and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life, especially that he had "done" World War II, that he had "done" the Algerian war. 
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. 
They start at the top of the technology food chain. 
But at all times, you're learning by doing. 
But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. 
But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory, mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures, and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. 
Let me introduce you to my brand new project, "Baroque in Rock," which became a golden disc most recently. 
Well, it's very interesting. 
But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds, what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am. 
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. 
Use more force? 
But, there is good news. 
Oops, I turned the wrong way. 
(Laughter) I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home, and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible! 
I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the 20th century, the people from Alexander Graham Bell to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers, I'd like to call them all up here, and they're going to call back to you. 
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs. 
But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect. 
This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley, and when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who's a world-renowned professor of philosophy, and I talked with him about this, and he said, "This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics, and up through Descartes. 
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting. 
Now, that kind of slavery is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. 
And we take samples of the sediment, and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean, and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere. 
When you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that. 
And you hear a rustle in the grass. 
This was work from many people, but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. 
There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations, of ballot boxes being stolen. 
Now having a large brain, as you know, is a big advantage, because you can actually influence your environment. 
And mad and crazy and fun. 
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people. 
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance, whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem? 
No dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done. 
You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. 
These individuals are at specific risk, particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. 
Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that will be your clue. 
One of them is to take that real ... 
The Arctic -- a beautiful system -- a regulating biome at the planetary level, taking the knock after knock on climate change, appearing to be in a good state. 
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States, except that with the technologies that are coming online today, today's corrections, deletions, augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play. 
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches, but I got mine indoors, and what happened is that, if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second, you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights. 
Somehow they find their way to you. 
Now, what's great about it is that people are working on -- within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. 
And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is -- I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web." 
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better. 
I think that's probably right, although this is a controversial issue. 
So the students would take their mobile devices, take a picture, triangulate the location, send that picture to friendly military units, who'd come in and take out the snipers. 
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up, but Jim and I talked there as he left, and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?" 
This is the way our centers are set up. 
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging. 
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss. 
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on. 
Is it worth their while? 
These are patients currently on drugs, sharing data. 
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence, and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military, so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay? 
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. 
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals. 
We need to get over it so we can move beyond it, and our little brothers and our little sisters, and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives more than money and power and titles and influence. 
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus. 
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory? No. 
But what are your fish eating? 
(Applause) So why do we learn mathematics? 
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure." 
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress, walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited." 
You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information, because the handout has to stand without you over here. 
He found the foster parents, and he said to them, "Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever. 
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere, and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas, but we also have problems that, when we lose power, we can't open a window here, and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. 
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in. 
Now, during the boom, there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density, a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods. 
And because we connect it to what they're doing — For example, they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society. 
And it received quite a bit of attention. 
So I went to the company's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products. 
(Applause) I love to collect things. 
How can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing? 
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead. 
But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women, revealing some surprises along the way. 
Even after his father died, he was still trying to scratch that itch. 
She can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. 
(Applause) I get that all the time in Dubai. 
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. 
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. 
This is a robot, Autom. 
They actually want our cultural souls, and that's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this. 
The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. 
Now, a film. 
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading. 
Now that journey, and what took me from Essex all the way across the world -- by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists. 
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. 
Now I don't know why that's the case, but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult, you almost invariably learn it through your native language, or through your first language. 
And as part of this training exercise, these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive, hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation. 
How? 
and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children. 
It's not the nation-states that have potential access to mass destruction, but individuals. 
So we're zooming in. 
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. 
But just two weeks before that, the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. 
Your genome is made up of your DNA, your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are. 
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool. 
So, now we clamor for organic food. 
And in this, you'd have like a -- something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time. 
This is really a unique capability of the MR. 
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- " I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter) She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man." 
We can't see them directly. 
Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge, the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems. 
And finally, India has had the deepening of its democracy. 
I'm going to cut some veins, arteries. 
I call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds, but all be equal as citizens in a state. 
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. 
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better. 
Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. 
Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world, the prince of any wine cellar. 
It has de-professionalized publishing. 
An amazing fact is that, given the right environment and the right nutrients, a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. 
But without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections. 
It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. 
And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today, reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century. 
And that can't happen in a classroom. 
Everything's good, low unemployment. 
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that. 
Oh! Good going. 
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think, "What could we do to make Lesterland better?" 
It's not a priority." 
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. 
That was our simple party. 
And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking. 
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?" 
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems. 
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off. 
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great, they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose. 
TG: I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place. 
So I was thinking about peace, and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace? 
McKim found this every time he did it with his students. 
Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday, also has a 50 percent probability estimate. 
It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea. 
All of that's great, and I don't denigrate it. 
So I started smaller. 
I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. 
So, in the opening days of 2009, a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and said, "We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve, that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself." 
As you probably can't see the detail here, but this is his report card, and you'll see, he's got perfect scores. 
And third, while they're in this paddock they are, of course, defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field. 
But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. 
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces, and this is just the beginning. 
We haven't yet launched, but if you go there, you can sign up to be part of our private beta, which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks. 
And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED. 
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones, and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down, they should notify humans to their presence. 
I didn't have the framework. 
The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century. 
In other words, this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. 
And we managed to boil it down to nine. 
(Laughter) But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him. 
They work against the clock and against the thermometer. 
(Music) Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk. 
I was probably being a little extreme. 
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact, show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione, and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on, showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus. 
Richard Feynman was also a showman, an enormous showman. 
In that very short learning curve, you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record. 
I took here a model from robotics -- it's called the Subsumption Architecture. 
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. 
This is one that isn't a game yet, but really should be. 
And many advances now, we can do that fairly readily. 
And a similar analysis, I think, can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation, and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset. 
Well we're jazz musicians, so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. 
(Laughter) He was much younger in those days, and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. 
"What does it look like?" 
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. 
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself, it's another thing to help someone else do well. 
And this is something we can work on my lifetime. I felt I could make a difference, and so I tried to get out of the computer business, into the brain business. 
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology, to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition, that also challenges the conventions of space and skin, and rethinks our dependence on vision? 
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor. 
With this money, I hired a team of young engineers from all over the world, and we rented a factory in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 
We are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world. 
So anyway, let's go with the red pill. 
I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I've learned in the past 15 years. 
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices. 
Second, economic growth. 
And so the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood: a lot of young people. 
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner. 
This is the step off. He's written on that thing, "The highest step in the world." 
It's not true. Very unsafe. 
I will do so with the help of words, of course, but also a geometrical shape, the circle, so throughout my talk, you will come across several circles. 
I have two loaves of bread here. 
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas. 
And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. 
(Laughter) Now this may be a way of saying "pure beings" -- like in angels -- or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē, an eternal youth. 
Well, you are to ride a bicycle, carrying your own weight and also some other weight, so that you can earn the bread for the day. 
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. 
Having a safer working environment actually, and avoiding accidents, it makes the business more profitable, because it's a sign of good processes. 
And in 1945, he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly. 
But it was fun anyway. 
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters." 
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. 
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy. 
Anything else is more complicated. 
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life? 
Let's just stop treating people." 
Certain themes keep coming up: justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues, freedom. 
But just very quickly -- we'll just see if I can do this quick. 
It's actually just a drop in the sea. 
Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons. 
This may be one of those myth-buster things that we'll have to clear up here, in a minute. 
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this. 
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth, taking with it not only plants and animals, but the legacy of humanity's brilliance. 
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation. 
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice, because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested, and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities. 
We can have both models in our head simultaneously, right, that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together, right, the cognitive dissonance. 
And it's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don't know. 
But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why. 
So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? 
Or are they one and the same? 
So I said, wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence? 
I get interested in different kinds of subjects, I dive in, I research them, and then I try to figure out how to craft a toy around that, so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as I did as I was learning that subject. 
They were in the lab working, and they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives. 
(Laughter) So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can, and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you, what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to, is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that really kind of fascinating. 
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. 
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. 
But I took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society. 
So no matter how lazy you feel, you're not really intrinsically doing nothing. 
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples, she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car. 
Child: There is no difference here between classes, nor white or black, nor if you have money or not. 
And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. 
We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. 
The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. 
Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten by this mosquito, and you've had this disease, your body develops antibodies, so if you're bitten again with that strain, it doesn't affect you. 
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. 
So I finished. 
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. 
We knew it was like six, but we didn't know what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together to give us that massive number. 
So, step four: We needed to engage men. 
She showed off her expensive bags, clothes and car on her microblog, which is the Chinese version of Twitter. 
And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. 
And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines, not hard, fast rules. 
MRI generates over a thousand. 
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" -- brilliant editing to cut together things. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
We've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease. 
(Applause) Oh, thank you. 
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. 
And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work, exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong. 
It's not our problem. 
Change has accelerated as human populations rose. 
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk, but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward. 
And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just -- please try. 
There's a whole range of innovations that we have. 
Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. 
Two of us are doing it. 
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns. 
If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." 
So the engineer's boss said, "Find a way to quiet this train." 
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do, and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is, if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex. 
I could have shown a number of other problems. 
So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body. 
I love that term, "question propagation," this idea of questions propagating out there. 
What are we going to do with all this research, besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears? 
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal, of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks. 
But it's going to be here. 
What makes the heart unique? 
And the question to me becomes: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart? 
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. 
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. 
In the video a moment ago, you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells. 
They went because it was a big thing to do. 
There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter. 
So if you look, as I did, through this tour, and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions, look at the recipes that they come up with for learning, they look nothing like school. 
We're not asking meaningful metrics. 
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. 
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that. 
She understands everything, but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture, the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head, which is where the bullet passed through. 
This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids. 
And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. 
So she asked, "Eat what? Do you want to eat ice cream? 
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species. 
I just extended it." 
(Laughter) BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool. 
Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. 
(Applause) What I learned from the yo-yo is, if I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible. 
You do it in your sneakers. 
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends. 
They have about 28 of these instructions. 
When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. 
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. 
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish: I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual and organization you know -- will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved, so that within a year we have a thousand examples -- a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships. 
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually, extraordinary blue sky. 
And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration between nature and man. 
It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car's going to be in the near future. 
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that? 
And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do. 
And they said, oh no, you can't study theory about brains. 
But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked: no credit, no logos, no sponsoring. 
And this really got me excited because again, we found the same pattern: the more people change, the more it affected the growth of their tumors. 
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel, ate it and, you know, talked and left. 
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter." 
The size is the population -- big China, big India here. 
And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second, because that's really important. 
(Applause) CA: Here's -- We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. 
As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle, it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use." 
Mammoth Chunks. These things weigh, like, seven pounds each. 
It's also an idea that we have forgotten. 
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die. 
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open source collaboration. 
And what the surgeon might do is take some bone from your iliac crest, which is just here, and then transplant that somewhere else in the body. 
But nothing else does either. 
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain. 
And of course, I was immediately intrigued. 
Because in the mean time, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. 
If we know people who are planning to support orphanages, we should convince them to support family services instead. 
Isaiah Berlin put it this way: "Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable." 
Folks, I'm petrified. 
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I know you're wondering, what gives these males their sex appeal? 
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true. 
And let's see how this one works. 
It's there right at its heart. 
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is. 
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world, and still played in the Southern mountains. 
I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University, but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. 
This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. 
John went on, and Michael did too, to become some of the inventors of computer animation. 
Or now we have a few more choices. 
Hilarity ensues. 
And it puts some obligations on those operators. 
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. 
And now, four large panels: this is upper left; upper right; lower left; lower right. 
So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking. 
Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one: "Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine." 
Well some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. 
We can laugh together. We're going to get through this. 
Okay. This is Camp One. 
You don't want just any mountain. 
I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. 
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm, but also with very much the feeling realm. 
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people, that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. 
And then you have to store them at about minus 20 degrees C -- that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think -- with a very critically low moisture content. 
Yeah! I'm gonna get crazy now. 
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. 
So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. 
We would actually enlist them -- which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals. 
(Laughter) Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes? 
And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course. 
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. 
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way. 
I asked him, what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles? 
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. 
Actually, it's all just an idea. 
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain, when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else, it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn, it shuts all of that down. 
(Applause) A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it. 
And my introduction to business was in these $100 little infuses of capital. 
I heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers, the majority of whom were black, but there were a handful of white performers. 
Let's take a look. 
And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling, literally crumbling. 
This is just theoretical. 
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy. 
When we received the land, it was less than half a percent rainforest, as in all my region. 
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged. 
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity, and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient, between 45 and 50 percent efficiency. 
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this, there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working. 
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. 
But we learn a lot from that: not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size. 
You take these cells, you put them in a dish, and within three days, they look like that. 
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm and decide, "Oh, I know! 
Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls? 
We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases. 
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels. 
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought, gee, this is like a little treasure trove here. 
There are countries up here which are very poor. 
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media. 
But if I take that same data, upload it to deCODEme, I can look at my risk for sample type 2 diabetes. 
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts. 
I would predict, if you're a representative sample, that many more of you insure your iPhones than your lives, even when you have kids. 
(Applause) So a friend of mine who's a political scientist, he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like. 
For example, I took my two year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. 
What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TEDTalk? 
And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour-by-hour power demand. 
We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight. 
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures, and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way, and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope. 
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion. 
But what really matters to me, and I think all of us, is action. 
What percentage of infected people were killed by it? 
I find it such a profound one. 
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago. 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. 
And you know, there you had this little sign -- I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read, "Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here. 
And it looks like this. 
But if we use a little computation -- we use origami, plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. 
These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. 
Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey. 
They've grown used to their face; they think they're special. 
So this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures. 
Now, normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics, the third system of a rebreather. 
They take their diet directly from the Bible. 
But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho, where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet. 
It's a pivot between a process and a system. 
He lived by himself, he would come in for chemotherapy by himself, he would receive his treatment, and then he'd walk home alone. 
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda. 
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. 
(Laughter) A 37-year-old road worker. 
Who are these cousins? 
Thanks very much. (Applause) I have a question for you: Are you religious? 
So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves. 
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up. 
It funds research all over the place. 
In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process. 
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. 
Defeat would have come too easily. 
RSW: What's the status of the New York project? 
We have the support of governments now behind us. 
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years. 
So before I start, I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine, because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today. 
Hold on! Wait a minute! 
When you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish. 
"Needed more knowledge and more understanding." 
Do you know what it is? Anyone? 
CA: One of the questions from the audience is, with fracking and the natural gas process, what about the problem of methane leaking from that, methane being a worse global warming gas than CO2? 
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse. 
Rich Player: I have money for everything. 
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us. 
What's the commercial picture here? 
And scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework. 
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. 
And when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room, and of course also a water tower, an elevated water reservoir. 
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists; it's about your freedoms. 
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. 
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there. 
In all fairness, when I started writing this, I thought, "Oh wow, what does my company, what does Tudor do?" 
And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing. 
So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. 
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know, once you get home, it's actually pretty useless. 
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it? 
And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?" 
And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization. 
Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 
(Laughter) Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you. 
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together and you've got something really powerful, but we need to put them together. 
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question: "Well, somebody has to." 
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet. 
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers, of audiences of science educators -- so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds, and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising. 
And he did a painting of this experience, which he called "In the Realm of Music." 
In order to make their experience real -- they were unable to find any volunteers, and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being's area where the device would go, and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically. 
But of course, China has an enormous population. 
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here. 
So what about treatment? 
Pretty much everybody else who does polls. 
I believe in the power of ideas. 
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way. 
And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub, because he was photographing from the other, and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this. 
Thank you. 
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. 
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof, deliver about 20 watts per square meter in England. 
But how does context signal? 
To be a prime minister or a president, you have to have an ideology, you have to have a meta-narrative, you have to have a theory of how things work, you have to belong to a party. 
And it was a physiological response. 
Not so much. 
(Laughter) That shows you how bad it is. 
(Laughter) What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees, they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch, and they collect pollen and make it into a ball, and they lay an egg on it. 
You simply take the proton, and you hit it really sharply with an electron. 
A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. 
And they came into my room the next morning. 
And for that work, when I was a final year law student, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year. 
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. 
Let's pull this apart: I'll go ahead and explode it. 
So if there are genes like that, then you can imagine that, if you could change one of the genes in an experiment, an aging gene, maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan. 
So it's about the lack of research, basically. 
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise. 
They know what they're looking for. 
And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions. 
Yes, I went barefoot until I was 12. 
Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication. 
What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again. 
Most of them were about resources. 
We all think a lot about how to live well. 
You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff, mash it up, tell the story your way. 
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. 
So I'd like you to meet John. 
And they are interdependent over a long term. 
Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there. 
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. 
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year, and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030. 
What are you going to contribute? 
Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ... 
There was no separation of sexes. 
It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding. 
My family's poor, my area don't have better health care. 
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed, but I was not the only one there who had that reaction. 
Thank you very much. 
There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. 
So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. 
They are the elite. They are our leaders. 
And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away. 
What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage, do you think? 
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. 
CA: And they don't disturb you? 
And this, then, led to my big questions. 
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy, granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar, we will do it. 
Traffic moved better. It was much safer. 
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs, some 8,000 miles from the drill site. 
My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. 
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. 
"Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would? 
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today. 
Well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. 
I can also make him spin. 
You don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty. 
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico. 
And the key detail of this is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the SNL writers. 
It didn't matter who did the choosing, if the task was dictated by another, their performance suffered. 
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. 
And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth is almost over. 
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at? 
And so as we see in this image of light during the night, there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less, but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean. 
But you don't have to be a billionaire. 
It generates all of the buoyancy, all of the payload for the craft, and the batteries are down here hanging underneath, exactly like a balloon. 
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know. 
But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way. 
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King. 
It's taught [by] word of mouth, and it's an informal education system around this. 
We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time. 
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. 
Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts. 
So here's an image of red blood cells, and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells. 
We went through several wars during my time in New York. 
One of the things that we also need to do, is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world, before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. 
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach, a company dealing with simple forms, making good designers available to us, and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well, and it seems to have worked. 
This is very early rehearsal footage, but the finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks. 
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was 77 percent female. 
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture. 
I was in a small restaurant in Spain, having lunch -- one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself, and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet, and feeling very lucky, and a bus load of tourists arrived, emptied out, filled up the restaurant. 
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff, and of course having an energy crisis at the same time, where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio-energy sources. 
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic. 
I then kind of thought about the other cities in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design, like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles, and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic, and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can't afford cars, but it did seem that in many of these areas 
You turn up the heat, you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar, forming a brownish caramel, right? 
So, what is a black hole? 
So, just like nature, we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that, we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then, what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours. 
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years. 
So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. 
You can go all the way through. 
But actually when you look at female circumcision, you see that it has nothing to do with Islam, it's just a North African practice, which predates Islam. 
After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. 
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. 
There are no sidewalks. 
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things. 
But perhaps more surprisingly, the translations that we get from people using the site, even though they're just beginners, the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators, which is very surprising. 
The craniomandibular system is critical to that. 
What are we going to do?" 
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms? 
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients. 
And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. 
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. 
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon, things we want to protect. 
Soon, my business really started to take off. 
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys. 
The people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality. 
And I believe that for us, being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed. 
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme. 
Remember, until the 1970s, the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. 
And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. 
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
So this is my mini fabric farm. 
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration, I think this is the new zeitgeist: open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long. 
I need to know that this week. 
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice, I was blogging live from my tent, sending back a little diary piece, sending back information on the distance I'd covered -- the ice conditions, the temperature -- and a daily photo. 
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction. 
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us, but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. 
They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this, so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down. 
We are interacting with our entertainment. 
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. 
That's enough. 
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?" 
♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫ ♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫ ♫ You see what you want to see. ♫ ♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫ ♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫ ♫ the power of creation. ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫ ♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫ ♫ I would run, run away ♫ ♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫ 
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants, maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off. 
And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. 
So three toddlers with identical plastic toys, but with very different reactions to failure. 
Many of you, I think, have probably trekked here. 
So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care, but as I said, it's also a challenge for us. 
Now, faced with opportunities like that, does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx, bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose, and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe? 
I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people, which we will hope to see happen. 
But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. 
The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand. 
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc. 
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. 
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun. 
And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality. 
And just watch the change in colors in India, China, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. 
But I want you to note his co-author: Charles Lindbergh. 
(Applause) For a long time in my life, I felt like I'd been living two different lives. 
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system. 
And that's a little found object. 
Would you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people, would you like him gone? 
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone. 
I call this environmental arbitrage. 
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example, like Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey, Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso Chicken, and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies. 
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass, will deflect not only the trajectory of particles, but will deflect light itself. 
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach. 
We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization. 
What do you think? 
In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator. 
Where is the soldier in each son? 
Anyone want to hazard a guess? 
In September 1979, Scientific American came out with a single topic issue about the brain. And it was quite good. 
If they then mixed with each other there, then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside Africa carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world. 
I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort, is a kind of validation, a sense of being seen. 
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it. 
Because that's what will stop: economic growth. 
International organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, contractors. 
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty. 
And then we made this. 
But today I have been transformed. 
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people. 
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. 
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank, turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank -- clucking, gossiping as chickens will -- and they make a beeline for the cow patties. 
However, we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one-time use. 
And he had nine days to make it. 
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well, they could be thin, right -- but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" -- it's thick. (Laughter) So let me show you the shape-changing mobile. 
To understand and use it sanely, as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you. 
And here, I suspect, they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar. 
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital. 
The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here. 
Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this. 
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. 
And this is a pretty well-educated audience, so I imagine you all know something about AIDS. 
There are thermocouples on the engine -- little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them. 
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
I was released after nine days. 
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits, mugshots if you will. 
I have typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. 
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. 
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. 
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music: what and how. 
So what do we do? 
I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece, and there I met Kamila, a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context. 
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things, but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. 
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic. 
Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value. 
And you can see two layers of fibers, one in blue and one in yellow, arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles. 
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire. 
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? 
And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity, if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good, then that will truly be magic. Thank you very much. 
If I stand beside that truck, my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap. 
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945. 
Why is this so different for people? 
Someone else bought it and died. 
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes, is this note that says, when asked, what do you think of conventional foie gras? 
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid. 
And we're about two and a half years into a five-year study. 
I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen. 
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. 
Now this plant here, the baobab, could be part of the answer. 
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right? 
These are the filters and funnels of global capital. 
So just to finalize, we're all individual. 
Now, in one sense, the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial. 
Maybe you will cut? Lift. 
She was the only mother in the group. 
We've been able to take malaria out of a society. 
Time has been compressed. 
He said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. 
You know that would reframe civilization itself -- (Applause) -- and our whole system of economics, if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us: the sustainable species, living on a finite earth, ethically, happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations, or 10,000 generations -- that is to say, into the indefinite future. 
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low: 40 or 50 years in a lot of places. 
Another factor in Gando is rain. 
(Applause) Take a look at this drawing. 
And you see it has that similar circular form. 
(Laughter) But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back. 
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand anything that they're going to say, then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. 
Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon? 
It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight. 
And I also ask myself, does it really work? 
And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. 
And here is the twentieth century answer. 
Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus. 
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know. 
He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. 
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. 
And what do you do with this food? You cook it! 
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. 
By about 1970, some scientists were sitting around and they thought, "What in the world? 
I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler and more and more childish. 
(Applause) PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation -- in a sense the small, portable, DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being. 
Learn to manage it. 
After six months in Japan, 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands, hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs, the large majority — (Applause) — a large majority of which did actually find their home again, importantly. 
I become alive. 
Where have they all gone? I had no idea. 
Worst talk ever!" (Laughter) Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks. 
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo. 
Nobody wants to do this. 
And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards, then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. 
We got a human, someone who's very outgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection, and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experience what she was experiencing, so they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly, they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go, and then conveying those to the Tele-Actor. 
He then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment. 
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils, you multiply immunization rate by six. 
Six months later it's still gone. 
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues because, he says, "They're too busy on their email." 
Narrator: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. 
And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. 
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective. 
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. 
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter) They never did anything. 
Thank you very much. 
And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit. 
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. 
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there, nine kilometers away from the town and the temple, and said, "That's where we have chosen the location." 
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. 
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home. 
We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. 
They're legal things. 
We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago. 
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think, and from this experiment they moved on to chairs. 
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row, I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. 
I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. 
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. 
And all of this matters greatly, because public safety to me is the most important function of government. 
But anyway, (Laughter) I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid. 
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home after the Trojan War. 
So what do we do to figure out who is where? 
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim. 
You can find out about the latest security incident. 
So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D. 
And as the shark came round, it would hit the net, the net would collapse on it. 
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there: "Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured." 
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. 
That's where things are going to head -- still very early days. 
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation. 
These places bleached too, but they recovered faster. 
One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport. 
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in, and we started to build technologies, because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork. 
It's women who actually push history forward. 
And this isn't a think, it's a feel. 
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. 
We recognize them in relation to corporations. 
He had had the experience. 
So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments. 
But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes, we can still think there is one out there, and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. 
There are more people being raped. There are more wars. 
So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit, and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters. 
Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide. 
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important, and really reflect on the world around us. 
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." 
That's for sure. 
Because I'm an extension of my work, and if they love me, then they will love my work, and if they love my work, then they will love poetry, and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job, which is to transcend it to the world. 
Some people are born in hells, and against all odds, they make it to heavens. 
It also informs the decisions you make when you make products or services. 
We can all think of someone, often a young woman, who has been impacted by breast cancer. 
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. 
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation. 
Or the 1963 Jaguar: It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time, but the owners love it. 
(Laughter) This was movie day -- that she organized -- where all the kids went to the movies. 
Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man. 
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour, which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour. 
What's crazy is what we do today. 
They are not missing because they've died; they were never born. 
To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases. 
Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. 
And the first night she was there, she was told that at 4 o'clock in the morning -- her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open. 
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. 
They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience. 
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel. 
It was my longest operation. 
And gratefully, it didn't. 
Rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire, instead they now hack into your computer, enable your webcam, enable your microphone, and steal documents from your computer. 
Thank you. 
But it has a terrible catch, and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse. 
The building was a true bird-killer. 
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes, we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power. 
For those without disabilities, at age three, they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven, to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender, they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings, often without even a chance to say goodbye. 
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. 
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files, armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. 
He wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is, maybe somebody else does." 
And they did have Tofranil and other things -- Mellaril, who knows what. 
And while they were trying to break down the door, I climbed in through the window, and jumped in. 
Now that's called perfect pitch, and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano. 
They had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. 
It meant something that would connect us all together. 
You know, back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan: if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl, you could take her out on a chop suey date. 
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. 
But seriously, it's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions. 
Were we being followed? 
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite. 
And he said, "Yes, that's my wife's car." And I said, "Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer." 
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back. 
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts; it's called the Peace Building Commission. 
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is -- Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface, which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. 
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. 
That brings us to the third point I want you think about: the ethical review of research. 
I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy. 
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size. 
But not an applause of delight like before, an applause encouragement. 
And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies. 
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. 
The energy consumption of this typical tank here is 80 kilowatt-hours per hundred person kilometers. 
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this." 
And one of the major gaps in care, almost across the board, is access to safe surgery. 
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. 
Racially, the county is about 60 percent African-American, but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. 
Just in case, I don't want to leave the men out -- I am one, after all -- I have really bad news for all of you in this room, and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere: You all have a universally fatal condition. 
Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy. 
(Cheering) Sebastian Seung: What am I? 
All right, let's go. 
After, we become a fish; after, we become a frog; after, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey, and the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story. 
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle," and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. 
And I believe this change in the mindset, of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital, has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset. 
I'm totally clueless. 
You speak English, a futured language. 
And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest. 
So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here, because I know you have my back. 
You've also got flies, the size of flies, that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard. 
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year. 
We have charted our love for our child over time. 
Joseph Schumpeter called this "the process of creative destruction." 
We've also learned the penguins love robots. 
The transition will be this one. 
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges. 
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first, because it's still sage advice, even today. 
The world presented me with options, and I took them. 
Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon? 
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show. 
I was on crutches, my wife was next to me, my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. 
Who would go for bananas? 
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists, until somebody properly defines the terms. 
We have fading memories of that provisional temple, erected each time an adult sat down. 
This is a drug that was developed for cancer. 
And maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation. 
And some kids, when they get a bit older, start to lie. 
In one project in the United States, information has been gathered on 300 innocent people, 300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do. 
I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Berlin. 
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties, so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made, let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. 
That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated. 
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words. 
They were tired of ghost dances. 
You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed. 
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump. 
You're looking at her open lung biopsy. 
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. 
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times. 
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay, heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. 
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique. 
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. 
He needs proper medical attention. 
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances, and theirs might be as well. 
I can help. 
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.) Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips, the texture, right, and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. 
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right. 
What's the fourth one? That's how we test it. It's all about prediction. 
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform. 
Here's another one. 
So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart. 
Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing? 
I guess we could make a glow chicken. 
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2. 
We want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same." 
It isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women. 
"My name is Bond, Jamal Bond." 
And they should be treated with love and respect. 
You can visualize this now; it's not impossible. 
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. 
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. 
If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar. 
It’s classically learning by doing. 
I'm not saying I believe this, but this is the standard Freudian view. 
This is why wars get fought. 
Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. 
And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that. 
Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. 
It wasn't until we really left Earth, got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself, that we could understand our planet as a limited condition. 
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things. 
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. 
(Laughter) But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel, airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect. 
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA, and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional. 
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." 
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm. 
And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression. 
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing, and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out. 
So, it's a very productive system. 
And why not? 
And after even 30 years of doing this, after 30 years of exploring the ocean, I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea. 
And this is why. 
What happened here? What's the story here? 
And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale," this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing. 
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. 
Of course one can make a biological argument. 
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. 
So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up. 
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. 
BF: Yeah. 
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now. 
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym. 
In the other condition, they're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them. 
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes. 
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms. 
By forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam and its doctrine of mercy. 
But I don't really believe in architectural problems; I only believe in opportunities. 
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. 
Let me wrap it up. 
What I'm going to do is open up a website that I wrote. 
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit -- there's ego involvement, they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome, or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome. 
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan. 
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. 
(Laughter) Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel. 
What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language? 
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones. 
WISER sets out to document, link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement, and fastest-growing movement in human history: humanity's collective immune response to today's threats. 
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me, but these are pictures taken from Mars. 
Then, on September 21, that tattooed man enters the mart. 
Heart disease used to be the biggest killer, particularly for men in their 40s. 
Is there more energy coming in than going out? 
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning. 
(Laughter) So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people -- you know, can I afford it? 
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. 
And we can find those that we would call habitable, meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. 
"Well, acts of God. 
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that. 
When you have rain in a place that has no trees, in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream, brings soil, destroying our water source, destroying the rivers, and no humidity to retain. 
That says to me, at least in rats -- and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture -- that play may be pretty important for our survival. 
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory. 
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now. 
What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals, but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. 
It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. 
How to make it? It's simple. 
There's no American compassion. 
But before I get to that, I want to address something that you may be wondering about. 
But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider, if they have the right abilities and character, is to go into banking or finance. 
But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills, especially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education. 
They are going to be cued these three square words: "like," "not" and "head." 
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. 
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders. 
That's engaging in the wrong debate. 
So I joined a gym." 
They're in the back of our body. 
I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies, I've advised over 200 CEOs, and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. 
It was half as long. 
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf -- in Iraq actually -- and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road, screaming, yelling, furiously angry, and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified, didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic. 
That's what I try and show in my stand-up. There's good people everywhere. 
So it's essentially a completely abstract, a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world, and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. 
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. 
Fanning Island, 2,500 people. 
Now it's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question, we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees. 
(Laughter) Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. 
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. 
(Laughter) Besides, for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago, while we were on our walk, my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. 
So, they first create this foundation of equality. 
For when one is honored, all are honored. 
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive about what happened. 
So a high I.Q. 
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people -- and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things -- but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago, people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits. 
This is our thousand-core supercomputer. 
Well, you could try looking really cute. 
The collectors, the friends, the press, everyone said, "Nice, but thank you." 
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves. 
And if we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it, it's a meter long, two nanometers thick. 
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy, and other things might want to eat you, or consume you. 
We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space, they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything, and probably anything could happen there. 
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors. 
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there, but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star. 
And I don't know how I became one now. 
The policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities. 
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. 
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness -- have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ... 
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it. 
They have enough income for three families. 
So for example, if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand, you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. 
Isn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had? 
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst, they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history. 
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw, but in a slightly better rendered version. 
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now. 
This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone. 
And we did this because we think that it's actually going to allow us to realize the potential, the promise, of all of the sequencing of the human genome, but it's going to allow us, in doing that, to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells, not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective, much safer, much faster, and at a much lower cost. 
First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid, showing 85 percent biomass in the predators, that seems impossible. 
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. 
But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. 
They basically went out on a date, and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now. 
All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. 
This female can live only three to four days, and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs. 
Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control? 
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact. 
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. 
Two things: One, I never had sex. 
Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. 
OK. Now, if you want to understand autism, animals. 
Suddenly you've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window. 
And we started talking, and he said -- I told him what I was doing, and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. 
It kind of knows how stripes should run, how it should be shaded. 
But for an Adventist woman, their life expectancy is 89. 
I was in Dubai. 
If I've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems, it's this: just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence, just because they say it with lots of detail, just because they express emotion when they say it, it doesn't mean that it really happened. 
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food. 
So there is spill over; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them, while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience. 
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. 
It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. 
Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik? 
And I saw my work come alive. 
So low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. 
We do have the technology that's scaleable, and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate, so we're comfortable that this task can be accomplished. 
After the war, you opened your markets to Europe, you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy, and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge. 
And I would add a cautionary note here, however. 
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60's strip shopping center. 
An extremely important part of this project was about how I photograph these extraordinary people. 
(Laughter) So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this. 
And he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter) "But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on." (Laughter) "And we talked -- I talked to them about Movember, and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad one on one about men's health. I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was 
Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha, with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. 
We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers, as it does at AIMS. 
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete, my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever, as they said they were, my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me. 
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person -- Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. 
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union. 
The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey. 
This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages. 
Animals, just like humans, sometimes get strange tumors. 
If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time. 
He didn't die. 
We had our best Ph.D. students, our most advanced equipment around the world, we got 1/10,000th of the project done, so how're we going to get this done in 15 years? 
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. 
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. 
It's called The Cloud. 
And I'm not making that stuff up. 
You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so, "Honey, I'm in the pool," will take on a whole new meaning. 
It shows these women playing with these toys. 
And the second great thing about conservatives: they get ecology. 
In particular, there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets, when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. 
Love is something you discover. 
So this is an example. 
You can do it immediately, right? 
It's not very complicated code. 
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something, you can find out in two minutes? 
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum, but positive sum. 
That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago. 
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years, this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe, and it is not lunatic fringe. 
"No, I want to make maps of planets." 
61 was like 60, but a little bit more. (Laughter) She had prettier eyes, and an approachable smile, And like him, rough around the edges, casual style, And like him, everything was in disorganized piles, And like him, her mum didn’t mind if friends stayed a while. 
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.) This is one of the jackets you grew? 
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. 
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now. 
It's implanted with very conventional techniques. 
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence." 
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. 
A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. 
It was published in the literature. 
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based. 
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that. 
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes, or even cobras. 
(Laughter) But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either. 
Let's starting with sensing. 
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes. 
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. 
The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right? 
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am." 
It starts with a single sheet of paper. 
And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s -- Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said, "Geo-engineering won't work." 
Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right. 
Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen, and have repeated it at every conference on climate, that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming above pre-Industrial standards. 
Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. 
We were up in the mountains, 1976. 
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems. 
I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning. 
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels. 
We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral, and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. 
So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. 
But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked, that's when the problem arises. 
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss. 
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call. 
So, shortly, I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco-Heroes. 
You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court. 
We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897. 
In Manitoba, this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg, and this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site. 
We'd like to get therapies better and more effective. 
One is a flash of white light. 
This was civic mobilization. 
I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. 
Today I’ve had a really nice time, So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine? 
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high. 
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways. 
"You know, do people really use it? 
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. 
They do it to make a profit. 
Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in. 
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. 
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry, they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called "displacement maps" that animate as well. 
I built, along with my two brothers, the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala, and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen, but in their startup enterprises. 
The law requires accountability. 
So then we tried a blend, and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1, and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index. 
And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. 
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe, which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. 
I'll take that as my scientific legacy. 
So, his son said, "Dad, I have a sleeping bag, I'll sleep on the floor." 
In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries, the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past. 
But the system has moved me on because, as my family started to discover, there is no long-term concept in the health care system. 
So as we think about power in this century, we want to get away from this view that it's all I win, you lose. 
So I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial, how am I going to travel the world and find these artists? 
And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff, you need a lot of data. 
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. 
Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man! 
In 2010, right before the revolution, even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years, Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives. 
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there. 
And what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information. 
And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas. 
I think ... 
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. 
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. 
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water, which is often lacking. 
They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. 
But they understood something more fundamental -- the sheer joy in discovery, the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it, the richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are. 
Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect. 
And for me, poetry and literature have changed my life. 
MH: I'm really interested in the running thing. 
There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. 
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture, and the importance of the image: celebrity is born of photography. 
There's another hub in London, now, and the rest are getting set up. We hope to give the data away at some stage. That's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world. 
Was it designed around cars or around people? 
And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive, some are negative. 
It makes lots of energy. 
(Applause). 
For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis. 
So about three or four weeks later, we met a group of engineers randomly who had worked on the first private imaging satellite ever developed, and they told us that back in the 1970s, the U.S. government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff -- that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution, being able to see objects one meter in size, they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images, but get a lot of them at an affordable price. 
Here's a wonderful fractal. 
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay. 
People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. 
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard; it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here. 
Zoom in a bit more. 
The service providers, well, for the first time, they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years, not just one or two as often happens at the moment. 
And it was a beautiful urban day, and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. 
You want your kids to have a better life. 
For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk. 
Think how many discoveries they represent. 
We swivel towards each other, we do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk. 
Everyone has seen a street person, unkempt, probably ill-fed, standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting. 
And so I went online and I did some research, and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn, the social networking site for job seekers. 
You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh, and his character, Sherlock Holmes, was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell. 
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this, we'd love to hear about it. 
Now, it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura, I don't mind, but please look at each other, give them a compliment. 
She asked me to make sure you knew about it. 
It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can, in principle, subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy. 
And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up. 
And these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification, introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent, and also taking the hypothetical seriously, that is, wondering about what might have been rather than what is. 
He does not seem to be breathing. 
The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. 
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati, who are over in Tarawa, the westernmost group. 
The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling. 
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. 
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. 
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful. 
(Laughter) Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up, so a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK. 
The Internet is a fantastic resource for business, for political expression, for art and for learning. 
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one, because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts." 
This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation, because, without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants, advocating one of them, in preference to the others, is irrational. 
It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs. 
The trick was to decompose the computer's construction into numerous stand-alone modules, each of which could be individually specified, built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project. 
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience. 
We need it to connect us all together. 
See, I'm an artist. 
Communication between people, on the other hand, is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. 
And it had to be run in a quite new way. 
We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. 
And there's whole industries designed for managing bad people. 
You see, this place was zoned retail, and in San Francisco, they were not going to give us a variance, and so the writer who founded it, a writer named Dave Eggers, to come into compliance with code, he said, "Fine, I'm just going to build a pirate supply store." 
And every musical era had different priorities of these things, different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'. 
(Music) (Limited Frequency Music) I had patients tell me that those sound the same. 
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m. 
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness. 
That's one way to go. 
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. 
Which battle do you think is harder? 
It's actually very popular. 
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age, and you want to get as high as you possibly can. 
In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America. 
It has to do with watching people train puppies, and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills. 
More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector. 
And here's just one example. 
The woman's face looks like a watermelon. 
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. 
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared. 
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon, it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow. 
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. 
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. 
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause) This is there for every child, and every child can enjoy this. 
It's a room broken in two halves. 
We won't make it. 
And for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da Vinci. 
And with the material that's left -- because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it, they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school -- I packed it. 
SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne. 
We may not be that many, but if we are promoted as a good, positive example, there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again, coming to the bridge -- between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion. 
And I thought up a lot of ideas. 
This was our laboratory before. 
Whoops! Passed each other. 
["What does equality mean to you?"] ["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"] ["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"] It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that. 
They've come together. 
He keeps mobilizing. 
We are almost there. 
This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle. 
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places. 
That's the scary part. 
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U., they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. 
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them? 
Political, economic, psychological, whatever. 
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced. 
So the fishermen are catching more. 
And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12. 
In 1932, that's the picture. 
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia. 
But here's the problem: sometimes patients become resistant to the drug, and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free, they come back. 
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years, and we put them together. 
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective, and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately -- I think we've now turned it off, if I remember. 
It's just dough that is wet. 
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang. 
You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare, which you might expect, but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent, as those two spaces interface with each other. 
And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation. 
And I went on a run that I know so well. 
And I'm so grateful they did. 
Now all of this has been tremendous for the world. 
So are the pessimists right? 
And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy. 
The first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman, "a little break." 
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period. 
(Laughter) If you do that, you might think, "Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s." 
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. 
But you have to maintain it. 
All of origami comes from that. 
We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly. 
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. 
He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia. 
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time. 
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it. 
It plummets. Something is going on here. 
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D, and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest, and it's a person important to engage. 
The introduction of iron, in some ways, had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. 
I can look at your clicking patterns. 
In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. 
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff, it tastes better to you. 
So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well. 
And then when I took that moment to take a step back, magic. 
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service." 
And if you do that, you do that responsibly, I believe that instead of delivering Spartans, you can deliver maidens. 
I'll give you one, a syringe. 
does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. 
(Laughter) Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that, I think it would be good next year. 
And so he goes around the room, and then as he's leaving the diner, he first-names almost everybody he's just met. 
If you look carefully, you can even see a hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left, where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical. 
We have people who have, for example, taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine, so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more, you can point and discover the information. 
They bought fixed income securities, bonds. 
We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds. 
But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor to consciousness. 
In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword. 
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic. 
Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones. 
This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group, who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. 
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design. 
But then he said, "Boy, if you run into a lion, don't move. 
It listens to the lecture, and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis, and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis. 
They were about my age. 
But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers! 
So the next question, of course, is: Is there any effect on age-related disease? 
And in the process they use up all the oxygen, and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away. 
Well we can begin to ask those questions also. 
Sentient beings are co-citizens in this world. 
So I'd like to start by focusing on the world's most dangerous animal. 
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt. 
In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States. 
It's important to be accurate. 
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? 
But we also found some non-obvious things. 
And to my mind, the scientific method -- trying stuff out, seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. 
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams, and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun. 
Now is the time to believe. 
I think this tells us there is an opportunity. 
And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 -- a video game called EverQuest. 
But not only that. 
My head was cut open across the front, lifted back, exposing the skull underneath. 
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. 
This is only 1,000 galaxies. 
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires. 
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds, who are thinking these really big-picture, world-changing, life-changing ideas and technologies. 
While from the outside, these homes look like any other informal structure in the city, when you step inside, you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. 
In the morning, I am born again." 
How come this has remained the high-water mark? 
So what happened now is, when the watercolor was flowing into the structure, the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid. 
Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. 
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land, physically pushing people away from their homes. 
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction. 
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 -- [We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] — magically changed to this. 
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. 
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor. 
Because it is hard to make symmetry. 
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us. 
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. 
They wished they'd not packed rice. 
This could be our finest hour. 
Culturomics is similar. 
And what happens after the lights go out? 
Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance -- but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles in a particular sequence. 
So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline. 
Civil society is pushing, civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem, also in the U.K., and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing, and so on. 
It's an entire package of services, and it works. 
My ancestors moved to the United States. 
It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer. 
So, thank you. Another person, another card. 
There are two dimensions to authenticity: one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed. 
And then he said, "But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice." 
There is evidence from neuroscience. 
And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. 
And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for, and who has gotten above the laws. 
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel. 
We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS, and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing. 
There's a target somewhere here. 
So why did they go? 
And then rework the level of the health care systems, building stronger health care systems. 
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased. 
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world, beyond virtually any other part of doing math. 
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. 
Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm, and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD. 
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends, and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own. 
I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing. 
And there on the table we took her, in turns. 
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number, I want you just for a second to think of a million people. 
There's a whole family of curves here. 
I call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" -- that's a climbing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, what is there to be done? 
So, the approach that we took was the other way around. 
Well, who are we not to say this? 
Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. 
The third component of Coke's success is marketing. 
I mean, you lose. 
It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition. 
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? 
What does modern science have to say about this? 
The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves." 
And number three: We need to respect the creator, the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them. 
And still a third group got a message about being good citizens, preventing blackouts. 
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics, that it's not just about singing and dancing. 
And there's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because I don't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum. 
And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over. 
This is all natural. This is all natural. 
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long, you can only run one of these reactors for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it. 
Some things are not right, and you'll say these words are probably not English words. 
This has really invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up, to try and do something interesting with my day. 
Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price. 
Neptune's probably not very big in your life. 
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America. 
But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities, there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine. 
Read the license. 
"How much will it cost?" 
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. 
So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. 
She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet. 
So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind. 
I don't want to depress you too much. 
As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls? 
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment. 
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in. 
They want to visit us, see what's happening on the ground and make a decision. 
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere -- where you're doing something to the muffin -- you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse." 
Create a space for an office, a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. 
I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development. 
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. 
I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time. 
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. 
You went to the most expensive school and college in India, and you want to dig wells for five years?" 
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly: "Transparent. Market-based. 
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually understand these things. You don't understand shit." 
Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? 
But I would listen to people, hear their issues, draw in the sand, try to figure things out, and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing. 
And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. 
Eleven out of 14. 
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car, that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone? 
And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, "You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians." 
They tried harder, they persevered longer, and they were more resilient in the face of failure. 
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year, you'd need this much coal. 
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle -- pitch black. 
Look at the end to see the animal. 
Mystery number one is this: Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. 
The market is not alien to Africa. 
He said, "Dave, I pulled up the X-ray image on the screen on the computer at home." 
I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. 
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears. 
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says, "You! You're a student." 
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. 
To our knowledge they had no music. 
The women are very good about getting mammograms now. 
You read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red. 
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know. 
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them. 
The year is 1987. 
Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different candidate shapes, so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. 
This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. 
We became, or those victims became, more importantly, a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization. 
The subway was against, of course. 
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. 
These kinds of products are everywhere. 
And I think that if you're not, there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in, if you're a designer. 
Thank you. 
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. 
Why is this market worth getting at over here? 
In contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way, what you see are these regions in pink, which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing, thinking about what somebody else is thinking. 
You bodies are wonderful as they are. 
And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow. 
It's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of. 
Reductive listening is listening "for." 
And this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in California. 
Metamaterials, unfortunately -- A, it only works on microwave, and B, it doesn't work all that well yet. 
And these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel. 
It's meaningless. 
And the speed with which they associate it with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature. 
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting. 
It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too. 
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism, or it's a power struggle. 
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. 
They like to look at beautiful faces rather than plain faces. 
Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn that actually there's no trade-off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense. 
And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion. 
So without a doubt, agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. No question. 
(Laughter) When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. 
The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects, as you see on the right. 
Imagine for a moment that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you, there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs. 
This is actually one of the rangers. 
I wanted to know which poet he read, and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"], a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be: Broadway, baby. 
That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. 
"Danzon No. 2." 
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. 
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex. 
Are there moms who've raised boys around that table? 
So what makes people notice? 
It was run by the great and powerful parents, and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children. 
There are many, many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs, but those are all being standardized as well. 
Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone. 
And so the impact of one new telephone, which is on the vertical axis, is very little. 
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned, just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. 
It's actually relatively simple to do, technically, because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground, existing wireless infrastructure. 
It was all these things. 
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions. 
Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin. 
And here's one example that's really exciting. 
They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. 
A lot of humans have lived since then. 
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... 
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems, and when you do that, you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt. 
But well before my imagination was my vocation, my imagination saved my life. 
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this, you need a little bit more informatics, so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis. 
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other. 
So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test. 
Even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass. 
It's a performing arts school. 
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) — when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they're working, to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. 
One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. 
So this brings me to lesson number one: life can do a lot with very little. 
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough. 
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out. 
Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed. 
I said, "Can I quit school then?" 
On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens. 
And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. 
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level. 
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. 
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation." 
And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." 
The third point is, the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings, but in this day and age, you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside. 
After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated and raised the grade. 
Today we don't confront the chaos of nature. 
Most of all, I learned about love. 
We're hungry for culture. 
Now, in terms of biomimetics, as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature, nature becomes a much more useful teacher. 
We did see a bunch of people, a lot of them missing a lot of body parts, and parts they had left were burned; half a face gone, an ear burned off. 
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it. 
Now that we have concentrated sunlight, what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity? 
Abuse thrives only in silence. 
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. 
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. 
People can try and ban these things. 
It's in the smell. 
So I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves. 
(Applause) I have Excel. 
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men -- stay with me -- so that you can't hear the song, and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected." 
(Trumpet) But she jumps to action when called to duty! 
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog. 
And it's just amazing, walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator. 
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph. 
Indeed, the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. 
And surely, at three and four years old, I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice, but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. 
So the equation is conceptual. 
It's a very powerful system, and most of our communications consist of it. 
So, are we ready Adam? 
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. 
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. 
Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago. 
I really like the art of Mantegna. 
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of, like concertos and symphonies, but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment -- like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto. 
They would say, "What is this?" 
When I came out of college, I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California, and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that. 
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind. 
By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. 
How could we survive that? 
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten. 
When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism? 
(Applause) If compassion is so good for us, why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do, which is to really transform suffering? 
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that. 
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews. 
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings. 
So in the Philippines today, parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website, Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school, the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. 
And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods. 
This is doable. All the pieces are there. 
But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible. 
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle. 
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome. 
This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem. 
But as you can also see, projected going forward, the gap widens a bit and raises a bit, and this graph is only through 2021. 
Absolutely my favorite star in the world. 
So it's delivered overnight by FedUp. 
We expect, and others expect, that perhaps the FAA, the CAA might say, "You need to put someone in a suit that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft." 
So she comes to the rescue. 
And that became the baseline of what I was doing. 
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. 
If you do this, the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist. 
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. 
There’d be a paper princess Kate but we’d all stare at paper Pippa, and then we’d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper, because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices, papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists. 
And I ended up like going down the spices, and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper, thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. 
This is perhaps a first element of a change. 
So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this. 
What's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world, is, I think, only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor. 
It's really very simple, but really very complicated. 
I tried to grasp what she was saying. 
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent. 
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. 
Gray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas and back every year. 
On this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines, but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there. 
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?" 
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. 
Like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy, or things like that. 
It turns out that previous studies show, like this one by Saddler and Good, that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades. 
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about. And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about. 
So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. 
When I was a kid, growing up in New York, I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls. 
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you. 
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say, particularly from the United States, where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling. 
And originally it was a math problem more or less. 
While the carbon dioxide, vast quantities of it, gigatons, goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. 
It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic. 
I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania, children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society. 
Then you saw what that device looked like, that the woman was using to fix her migraines? 
But I took them outside one day and I said, "I want you to estimate the height of the building." 
Our neighborhood was full of large families, where fathers were the heads of households, so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment. 
Well, I've come up with seven things that, I think, show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. 
He was hoping it was going to work out okay. 
In fact, the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas, help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. 
But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid. 
Here's a short glimpse from those years. 
What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry? 
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies, proximity to death, or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death, I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. 
It's what the money motivates, that we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. 
And our PC version became quite mature. 
things die when there's no food. 
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school. 
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering? 
And David won't take "no." 
Experience is about responsibility. 
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. 
There is only one option, I'll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists and scientists, and that is to do the unthinkable, and to use livestock, bunched and moving, as a proxy for former herds and predators, and mimic nature. 
This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed. 
He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say, "We have rights." 
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. 
And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. 
What kind of world do we want? 
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there, and I could never get rid of them after that. 
If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up, then the figure becomes astronomical. 
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature, only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on. 
As you know, an animation is a series of images. 
And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. 
So, that's the bonus. 
(Applause) I’m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician. 
But I knew what he meant, because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then, basically, index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't. 
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology, because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute. 
She came to me bloated, very pale. 
There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. 
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games, there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest: cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. 
Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly, efficiently and cheaply right where I am. 
Shinseki was right with the argument. 
I said, "You make your own groups of four. 
If I take a stand, it makes a difference." 
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old. 
All of a sudden, NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans, but they were taking [them] into the negotiations, partly because they represented the victims of these weapons. 
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything. 
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world. 
And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. 
Coprolites are fossilized human feces, and they're actually extremely interesting. 
We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling, if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect." 
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman. 
You can follow this in the Guardian. 
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese -- designed by Michelangelo, built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape. 
And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. 
Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. 
There are microbes which, through their metabolism, produce hydrogen sulfide, and they do so in large amounts. 
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N., staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. 
And with that growth comes some severe practical problems, one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it. 
So here's an example. I'll use a figure eight, tracing out a figure eight as an example. 
So we are creating Dylan, which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive, and autonomously discovering: What are the objects in this visual input? 
We were risk takers, of course. 
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay. 
Political parties: oh boy. 
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up. 
Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that? 
As far as national representation, 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter. 
She was offered a hysterectomy, but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option. 
Wild is love. 
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813. 
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard: A people's dream died there, and it was a beautiful dream." 
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called "Julian Po." 
(Music) Okay. 
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast. 
The Dalai Lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. 
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use, and she is decidedly not an energy geek. 
I took some photos, and this is a billboard in Florida, and either they hadn't paid their rent, or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign, and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down, so they just teared out sections of it. 
You know we're being penetrated. 
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped. 
And I also strongly encourage you, and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards, to think about, how do we actually prioritize? 
They drag him out on the boat, and he's -- evidently, I didn't see any of this -- but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out. 
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives. 
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. 
PM: Gabby, has your recovery been an effort to create a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords? 
The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions. 
The best way to learn about anything is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish. 
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. 
For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 
So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. 
So this is Ben 80. 
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall, to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work. 
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it. 
She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities. She's going to give up university to look after Mum. 
Self-injury. 
You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. 
The first: study up. 
When you go home, tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information, they don't have to do it. 
I've never felt as small as I did in Antarctica. 
And often it does something more. 
The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has halved. 
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours, the number of days. 
They were not people from outside. 
This is a view taken along the summit ridge. 
(Piano notes) AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it. 
She will create another 100, 200 more jobs. 
I canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went. 
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? 
And as a result of those high expectations, we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them, not simply to survive in science and engineering, but to become the very best, to excel. 
I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment. 
Well that's what's actually happened so far. 
Because no one's really watching. 
For example, even our videos are not just videos. 
This is a 15 year-old boy. 
That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch; the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve. 
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies. 
It doesn't always mean plot or fact. 
But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away, the dolphins will start whistling, they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group, wait for the boat to go by, and then they'll get back to normal business. 
Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon, a thought-controlled computing company. 
We could, for example, mimic infection, where we add bacterial cells into the lung. 
For some reason you guys are just really slow. 
Why is it not taught? It's crazy. 
(Static) (Crackling) (Static) (Crackling) This is the planet Jupiter. 
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay. 
And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. 
And it's also something that resides in each of us, to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today. 
TSA -- thousands standing around. 
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it. 
But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators; you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe. 
So given that that's true, how good are we at increasing our happiness? 
And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain? 
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems. 
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. 
A person comes out, they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back for a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter -- but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. 
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering. 
There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience. 
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times. 
They're a great model for flies. 
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. 
We're talking about something very similar here. 
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics, moves the continents around, forms ore deposits. 
And we see that in some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong. 
And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. 
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city. 
So they're like perfect actors. 
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today, to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause) It is part of corn's scheme for world domination. 
A lot of it didn't pan out. 
And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete. 
So how did we achieve this success? 
(Laughter) All right, what is complexity in this view of things, and what is emergence? 
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity, but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD. 
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. 
I really miss that era, you know, where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you. (Laughter) But Babbage, Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century, and was a fairly famous mathematician. 
Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. 
So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special. 
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream, "4chan!" 
Second, the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque, with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved. 
But they did what they could to stabilize the people. 
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. 
I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. 
That's the warm up. 
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources. 
(Applause) I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years. 
So this was a trick to get these two sides. 
(Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. 
We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020. 
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside. 
That video was made in the spring of 2011, and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people. 
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia, but I do think we have to give people back some control. 
And this ethical problem's a big problem. 
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes." 
You're going to place this in an oven-like device. 
And then I went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking. 
I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move. 
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book. 
We were on the stage and then -- by the way, spectacular. 
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants. 
How do you judge people based on the content of character? 
It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo chambers. 
It's phenomenal. 
You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades. 
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically, what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. 
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country? 
And on the other side there was a rising sun. 
And secondly, it's ignorant. 
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise, but we do it in the lab all the time. 
One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley, who was a famous ophthalmologist, or at least became a famous ophthalmologist. 
So time and again, I found people like this. 
New ways of making electric transportation. 
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator, so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of, you know, following the rocket all the way down, and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing. 
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health. 
And if you looked very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils, and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles. 
And so that became the governmental goal -- is, how do you stand out in this chaos, which is an expo of stimulus? 
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us, and the stress created in families by dying is enormous, and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else, so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you've got a choice. 
It was an opportunity that was missed. 
These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and what it does -- the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. 
But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. 
But guess what? We do not know exactly how they will take this into account. 
Now, this would require nutrients and water. 
So there's actually a conversation, which has never before happened. 
And then of course Arnon to Thoth. 
We also are going to need political innovation. 
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. 
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational, and they're highly disciplined. 
Now, I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia, and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry. 
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. 
That's all true. 
We object to genetically engineered food. 
But I think they're doing very important work. 
But it didn't make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl: they were going to go to school. 
Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up. 
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement. 
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago. 
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958, Yutaka Taniyama killed himself. 
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today. 
And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. 
We can say, "It's luxurious time." 
And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. 
Evidently, a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin, it's sending a venom. 
So when you think about it, we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. 
So that's a scooter, but she had -- well, she still has a BMW motorcycle. 
Each one has got two games. 
As I diminished, I grew. 
There was no way they could win. 
(Laughter) So the main element though, the main complaint we get -- and one that I find most worrying -- is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist on ruining the magic? 
I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers. 
When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. 
(Laughter) But there is good news around the corner -- really good news. 
Sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it, but you're not 100 percent sure if you can because you don't know if the source is credible. 
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. 
Don't do it. 
But I've become increasingly interested in religion. 
Now, you may not believe in ancient sayings. 
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common. 
Thank you. (Applause) There's something that I'd like you to see. 
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980. 
If you mosquito-proof houses, when people get sick, they're sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can't get to them. 
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith," which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people. 
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask: Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines? 
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so. 
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner." 
So how can we change this dynamic? 
I climbed out of the ice. 
He survived the Middle Passage, and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia. 
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance. 
And one day, my father actually took me into the bush. 
So I did just that. 
And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures, we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups. 
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table. 
After all, we are the mouse. 
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature. 
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy. 
Look at the fat layer. 
So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. 
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. 
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program. 
The "my" means it connects with something deep inside your soul. 
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. 
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da. 
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat, the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot. 
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter) And all this time, I never saw a single rat in any of these places, until recently, when I was in the London sewers. 
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition. 
You have a mind. And you have other people. 
And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense. 
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video, and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots. 
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. 
And that's what we really need. 
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze. 
He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. 
Here I have a bunch of other examples, all suffer from the last mile problem. 
So they went on about their business and from a foot away, we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. 
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA -- the Trilogy Emergency Response Application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since. 
And I've had some incredible warm-up acts. 
I want to say this and emphasize it, because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today. 
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but... 
But again, a little diversion to the topic of organ donation. 
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful, are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that, because we can realize that their complexity is not random. 
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions, and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. 
He wrote a long time ago, you know, thanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, mini-cams and more, the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. 
And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. 
But then I went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced. 
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking itself against the best in the world, and it became a huge brand. 
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense. 
They say that we reconstruct reality. 
And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me. 
It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien." 
So a natural answer is 99 percent. 
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. 
What we're saying here is the probability of an attack killing X number of people in a country like Iraq is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack, raised to the power of negative alpha. 
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches. 
And then eyebrow raised, indicator of surprise. 
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. 
You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal -- it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol, in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications, traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society. 
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. 
We don't have a neutral word for it. 
The ability to make and test models has become essential, not only to every single area of science today, but also to modern society itself. 
He has this little 10-square-meter store, where so much is being done. 
One is another American inventor Ted Henter. 
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. 
And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice-based food web. 
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam. 
So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future. 
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. 
But densification is not going to work everywhere. 
So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative. 
(Laughter) Actually, we're not going to have to talk, we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. 
It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. 
So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. 
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. 
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours. 
It's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties. 
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatically. 
This is a little risky. 
And he looked at his daughters, and he puts his hand on his chest, and he says, "So, Gov, tell me, who is ever going to hire me? 
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. 
I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order, and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names, their mother's maiden name. 
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now, an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim. 
But, when it encounters a very extreme terrain, in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot, Then it switches to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder, and camera systems, to identify the obstacle and the size, and it plans, carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility. 
We don't actually solve all problems. 
It's what makes a child play a violin at home, while his father works in his carpentry. 
We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. 
We have now data of about 15 years, to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions. 
This is, it seems a bit dull you know. 
While these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country, it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done. 
There was an eight year-old girl, a 10 year-old girl. 
It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. 
Well, we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting, and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things, but that's for the future. 
I don't understand where the idea came from. 
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web, and we're all visualizers now; we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. 
But it is really a worse social model because of what's involved and the cost to all of us. 
But it's definitely an interesting new worldview. 
But I figured I gotta do this. 
We exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins. 
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you? 
Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need -- they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing, warmth-requiring creatures. 
And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today. 
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill. 
I think you can get change. 
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion. 
And he says, "I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free." 
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups. 
I want to say to you Richard, in closing, that in TED you've created a home. 
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. 
A study published last year found that from birth, from the moment of birth, babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language. 
It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship. 
The good projects, which we as a donor community would take under our wings, they took years, you know, you had too many studies, and very often they didn't succeed. 
One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we've got our priorities out of sync. 
They're not building transmitters. 
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect. 
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground. 
One run on one of these machines: 200 gigabases in a week. 
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. 
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. 
He lived for another 10 years, then the Macedonian faction caught up with him. 
From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors. 
And we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence. 
While you're thinking about that, this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore, a psychologist in England, who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test: How much did they believe in the paranormal, supernatural, angels and so forth. 
You can take it really, really far. 
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. 
So I thought that it will be good to start with it. 
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park." 
One of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis, who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and -- rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said about where songwriting's going. 
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market, and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel, and in that panel, between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing, I'm trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building, and totally, if necessary. 
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. 
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it. 
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians. 
And it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy. 
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often. 
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. 
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted. 
Biological yield is really important. 
And these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee, with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible. 
They have electricity, but the question is, how many have washing machines? 
Who have been doing that? 
The interface is the OS. 
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease, or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease, 140 million Americans have one or more chronic disease, and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease. 
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do. 
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention. 
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!" 
At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers are melting fast, faster than the Arctic. 
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. 
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls. 
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars -- which I know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking, "Let's use fuel-efficient cars." 
So they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. 
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both. 
It's the interchange of ideas, the meeting and mating of ideas between them, that is causing technological progress, incrementally, bit by bit. 
You can't type very much on this. 
Yes? OK, Steve Jobs. 
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees, but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. 
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay. 
Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. 
Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game. 
You bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it. 
Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. 
But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention, it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get. 
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie. 
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary. 
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah. (Applause) They deserve a hand. (Applause) The first phase is in getting better information in. 
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature. 
What can we do? It's not so easy. 
And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized with all the go-to, go-back-to, also made into a beautiful choreography. 
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women, selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people, you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. 
Now, this is an interesting little message, and it's a lesson that has since, I think, been forgotten or lost or something, and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface. 
Let's call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel. 
So you've got an interface that has no interface. 
A bit more searching through the profile and there's a photo of their office. 
Thank you for being here. 
To see a vision of the universe that's more perfect than our own. 
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. 
We've launched them. 
So we then look to do this with pairs of individuals, starting with two Africans, looking at the two African genomes, finding places where they differ from each other, and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like? 
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube, and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower, just on the right species, what happens? 
And that was when I started to write a book, because I didn't think it was miraculous. 
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale. 
We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence. 
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. 
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned. 
It goes up to four meters per second when it runs. 
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. 
And that's why it's great to have collaboration. 
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival. 
I did no longer want him to die or to murder him, and I felt free, much freer than I'd ever felt before. 
It is an easy answer. 
And so this is not a video. 
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine." 
Suddenly, I had a body, a body that was pricked and poked and punctured, a body that was cut wide open, a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed, a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it, a body that was burning from chemicals. 
Go tell Facebook to figure that out! 
On the one hand, result. 
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? 
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening, was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say, and so I stopped listening. 
And it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car. 
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment. 
And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings. 
This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India. 
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening? 
This picture was taken two weeks ago. 
They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. 
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much. 
If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison cell upgrade. 
MK: Yeah, that was it. 
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver. 
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life. 
Yet it would do very little good. 
Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be. 
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals, if you're a company, what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation, or 100 people who are in charge of innovation. 
Well, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. 
Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you, and then it will really be a good day. (Music) (Applause) Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you. 
We believe in you, we don't believe in you. 
"My child, what are you doing here?" 
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx. 
It can make me feel this? 
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent. 
We'll look at sea level rise. 
Also, the people had changed. 
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation. 
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. 
And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you're sitting next to someone. 
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms. 
I had to see my coach screaming for me, "Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!" 
So first, five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom. 
I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is. 
There are two ways of thinking about this. 
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand, soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. 
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid. 
And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe. 
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. 
They are symbolically fed and cared for, and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions, which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
This is, you know, the movie poster. 
And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality. 
That's a very appealing picture, however, it's just not true. 
They had no safety, no real technology. 
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market. 
I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation. 
And, aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example, the E. coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved: this would be lives saved. 
We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us. 
So I made a lot of work in the '90s. 
There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting -- through the action of testosterone. 
There's actually only about 20 people on each page, because we have the name, address and telephone number of every single person. 
So where have we got to? 
The American people, taken as a whole, when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues, are moderate, pragmatic centrists. 
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church. 
Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS. 
How disgusting. 
Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. 
The first year we got nothing. 
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice. 
But then -- and here's the trick -- Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people, "You know what? New rule. 
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. 
And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves, and you get a big mess, a big mess that you can't possibly clean, you can't touch, you can't extract and, I think most importantly -- this is what I think -- you can't see it. 
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. 
For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card. 
That's number one. Number two: This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create. 
You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat? 
This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right." 
They said, "We look at it every day." 
We need a little bit of police; we need a little bit of military, but for defense. 
Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist, they made her think and think and think again. 
Let's actually try that. 
And they get inside, and they get it all on. 
And so after I developed Avaz, I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar to children with autism. 
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own. 
No arms at all. 
And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years. 
And I have a passion for images and for words. 
It weighs less than a gram. 
There's a protocell AB now in this system. 
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. 
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares. 
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball. 
Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room. 
(Whistling) It's easy, isn't it? 
We can take the easier road, the more cynical road, which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was, a fear of each other, distancing and blame. 
(Applause) What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict, and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. 
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. 
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin, so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery. 
Many of them we haven't benefited much. 
They look like they're expensive, but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot -- like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years. 
It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us, which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us. 
Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder. 
This is the root of the clash of civilizations. 
Not only that, they're able to do it lap after lap after lap. 
And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. 
And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations, what are the externalities? 
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters, and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. 
You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products. 
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance. 
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year, seeing how it was 100 years before, 1,000 years before? 
So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution, Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. 
So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin? 
We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. 
We go back down. It's going to go up and down. 
And by the end of September, he was living on the streets somewhere in France. 
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. 
Well it doesn't break even. 
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually. 
So we started to change genes at random, looking for long-lived animals. 
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
Does anybody know what he was looking for? 
(Laughter) Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted. 
And she said that it's a rather boring movie. 
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets. 
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D. 
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership. 
A child a week was dying, but nothing changed. 
And with these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month. 
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey, that would be bad. 
It only works about 12 months. 
Now, I prefer that term over magician, because if I were a magician, that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic. 
It's totally strange. 
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly. 
What I do with my kids now -- I've got two, nine and seven -- is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard, looking for stuff that needs to get done. 
I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life. 
Here are the types of thinking: photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me; pattern thinkers, music and math minds. 
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging. 
We don't have anything to translate that will into action. 
Not authorized, but not illegal. 
We wanted people to get involved. 
And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference." 
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim, "Walking distance to Le Grande Orange," because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call "a third place." 
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing. 
But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart, or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. 
I supported the war in Iraq. 
Why as a result, what happens? 
We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize. 
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again." 
It's pretty exciting. 
No legends, no fairytales. 
Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system. 
So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet, but I don't know. 
We needed to reduce the population growth rate. 
Hours earlier, when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman, the two men got to speak for the second time ever. 
Can Ethiopia do this? 
He painted a beautiful Vermeer. 
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is, they switched all the rules round, so that the way to successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country, has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new — you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter) Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one. 
It's not about overthrowing capitalism. 
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors, the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives? 
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is, and it's been really, really hard. 
That's their problem." 
Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem; home for many of black America, very much the psychic heart of the black experience, really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed. 
We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. 
So here is a little question for you. 
Those of you who can see will know how many notes, but Derek, of course, can't. 
And once again, this is, for me, interesting. 
Descartes. (Laughter) Before the horse. (Laughter) Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around. 
And just so you know, 1982-'83, that El Nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. 
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process, and that's actually what we did. 
(Laughter) So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father -- and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert -- decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria, particularly among Igbo women, the Billings ovulation method, which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. 
One of them is from Mr. Einstein, and he says, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." 
And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. 
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies. 
And that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium, and it absolutely looks beautiful. 
(Music) It's really a remarkable, awesome thing that happens there. 
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. 
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros. 
(Applause) Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. 
Just a few moments. 
However, it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization. 
So the DNA is really badly mucked up, whereas if you have a chance of surviving, the DNA isn't so mucked up. 
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. 
But for the moment, that's the case. 
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. 
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. 
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. 
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary. 
We have just published an evaluation of this program, and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable. 
Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another. 
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen. 
(Laughter) But by the time you get to block nine, you see that respiratory syncytial virus. 
My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen. 
And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air. 
(Laughter) But basically I love being a woman. 
It is practical, and pretty too. 
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium, that light becomes literally a building material. 
Let's visit where these creatures live, the northeast Amazon, home to the Akuriyo tribe. 
So that big sweeping, white sphere in the corner is Saturn, which is actually in the background of the picture. 
That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality, come in, release her spirit. 
So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law. 
Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused, more efficient, more results-focused. 
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday." 
By now, these things just feel wrong. 
We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware. 
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives. 
It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage, it was buried in the paper. 
That has been achieved after two years of work. 
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. 
And at heart, both reformations, I think were asking the questions: who's entitled to practice? 
This is a room of sleep-deprived women. 
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like. 
I'll tell you the quick story. 
Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. 
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers? 
And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was. 
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't -- the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves. 
Thank you, Sergey. 
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch, and I'll take you there for a minute. 
We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer. 
And I realize this is a global forum, but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history, in some places, not all, of American ideas being appropriated, being emulated, for better or for worse, around the world. 
It's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems. 
What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save. 
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds. 
(Honk) So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations. 
The history of Christianity, the internal history of Christianity, is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing, and it's also involved in struggles with other religions, obviously starting in the Middle Ages, a struggle with Islam, in which, again, it was the infidelity, the fact that they didn't believe the right things, that seemed so offensive to the Christian world. 
That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. 
This is Van Quach. 
It's also about how appearances deceive, how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things we didn't intend or don't like, and Armantrout's style is trying to help us stop or slow down. 
Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola. 
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it." 
And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight. 
In fact, more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male. 
But they said to us, "You know what? 
And we just record what we see." 
How are those resources really created, the resources we're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges? 
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck. 
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. 
(Laughter) So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. 
It is not the infrastructure, not the toilets, not the libraries, but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. 
"What are you doing here? 
That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer. 
Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements, they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord. 
Now, how do you do this? 
Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy. 
Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this. 
Right now it's very exciting actually for me because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that's my new title. 
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance. 
I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words -- which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content. 
Thank you very much. 
And as you think of the implications of that, here's a brief history of the universe. 
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him. 
I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. 
Now I do own stocks. 
That's the inferred task trajectory, and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. 
We talk about what still has to get done, what's so critical to get done in the lab. 
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier, headier days. 
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around. 
Censors and transparency, the overheads go in both directions. 
And we're going to show you, instead of the kill laser, which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse, we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time; otherwise, you can't see it very well. 
And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google, both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that I was away. 
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. 
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko. 
Of course, as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible, and that's what was said by Suzuki. 
But in Rwanda, in one country, they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her -- that's the rule. 
This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle. 
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times. 
Pianist transforms to violinist. 
(Music) See? He is there 100 percent, but not commanding, not telling what to do. 
There were several steps to this. There were two sides: We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules, and we had to solve the biological side of how, if we had this new chemical entity, how would we boot it up, activate it in a recipient cell. 
Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car. 
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. 
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!" 
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. 
This here, on the right-hand side, is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel. 
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan. 
You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. 
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from, which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience, of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are. 
But now, three years later, here's where we stand. 
Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you. 
You prove one, you prove the other. 
Flavor is king. Flavor rules. 
The cheetah generation. 
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. 
I do get tired, as we all do. 
This is called "The Dress." 
So it's a tree, and in its trunk you have the roots of languages. 
And if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve, for example, you'll get motor neuron disease. 
And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. 
Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. 
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane. 
So this is a mystery. 
We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally. 
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. 
We're going to have to do everything very differently. 
And I wonder what he's soaking in. 
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP, really unsustainable, really dangerous. 
How many would opt for memory? 
And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world. 
Now, don't get me wrong. 
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you -- part of acquiring the skill or ability. 
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand. 
And look at those great-grandmothers. 
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks, and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different components that I'm working on, and again, it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. 
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. 
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others. 
Now, of course, that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on. 
These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders. 
And the more we learn, the more that was reinforced. 
And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure. 
So, how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other? 
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books. 
Good morning. 
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. 
So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. 
It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles. 
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. 
But they couldn't get the results they wanted. 
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense. 
Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is? 
And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. 
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property." 
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective, we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass, and all of a sudden, you get this biology. 
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again, and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone. 
Everyone watching. 
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device. 
And so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas, hydro-electric, which in most places is maxed-out -- and nuclear. 
(Laughter) The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham, but absolutely no baloney. 
He rewired it. He invented it. 
And then they create, in real time, a facial composite of these two friends. 
But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago. 
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else. 
Each one of them is completely different. 
I'm going to move to some pictures of China. 
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects. 
Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar, like this CAPTCHA. (Text: invisible toaster) Then what you're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it. 
But if you want to look for effective charities, this is a good website to go to. 
And they would see a coral head, maybe 10 feet away, and start moving over toward that coral head. 
The question is: How likely are they to do that, and if they do, how do they do it? 
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. 
It's about something in between. 
He is a bridge figure. 
So this is an amazing kind of result, and it really shocked us when we looked at that. 
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females. 
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure, and so basically -- and what do they learn from it? 
This is brand new. 
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison. 
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter) MM: I should leap in. 
We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. 
Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you. 
SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate, and I think probably because animals have taught us that. 
(Laughter) But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. 
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. 
This is a nuclear-proof facility. 
Look what happens when we keep going. 
What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment? 
And so, the real question is, what is the challenge? 
One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person, and yet, as the game unfolded, we saw very notable differences and dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. 
(Applause) Other people. Everyone is interested in other people. 
We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis -- you name them, we went to see them -- the secretary general, all of them, and said, "This is all wrong. 
And we really appreciate you all being here today. 
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships. 
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels, and then I ask people, "Which one do you prefer?" 
Well, that's less than one percent of the surface area of the bay. 
Let's continue with that same excerpt. 
We know that money is very important, goals are very important. 
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. 
And that's because Everest is so high, it's in the jet stream, and winds are constantly scouring the face, so no snow gets to accumulate. 
In fact, just as I was writing this talk, I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks. 
But there is an underbelly. 
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. 
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." 
I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system. 
Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. 
So, I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore. 
It is the best place on the planet, many say, to study the history of climate change. 
He can make his own spears and axes. 
And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. 
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it, as it's now the most represented language on the internet. 
In most of my work, what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material, but then the pages inside are still loose, and then I carve into the surface of the book, and I'm not moving or adding anything. 
And here's Hedy Lamarr. 
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. 
Now if you think about it, if I tossed a coin a hundred times, and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times, then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads. 
He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice. 
That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. 
Why does this happen? 
It was dying well before he did, and now it's on its last legs. 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. 
I wanted to make a sequel. 
At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. 
Would look at it. 
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer. 
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well, a very interesting observation, that actually those strange little signs that actually flash "35" at you, occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown, according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit -- those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras, which come with the actual threat of real punishment. 
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. 
When it came back, I went to see the shaman again. 
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate. 
You could jump off the end into the deep end. 
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick." 
Now, we all think that Shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays, too, and the most well-remembered essay is one called "A Defence of Poetry." 
This is one reality. 
Children pick up disease in the place that's supposed to love them and protect them the most, in their homes. 
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope. 
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. 
And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. 
In particular, things were a lot denser. 
No special needs schools. 
Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade. 
Those are all shrimp. 
And she put her head back and she said, "It feels like leaping into heaven." 
As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help? 
But as was the case for most of my generation, I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. 
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe. 
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be. 
(Applause) It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression, and I really like this image, but a lot of people think it's fake. 
The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have, it's how you use the bombs you have, and more importantly, whether you ought to use bombs at all. 
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you." 
And so the lecture moves on before, really, most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked. 
As one woman said, "I’ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes, and they’re always there for me and nobody else is. 
This next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream. 
But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. 
It's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits. 
That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. 
But they were right. They were exactly right. 
And he turned to his friend, and he said, "This boy and me have a deep, deep connection, deep, deep connection." 
And they're the same ones that I have today. 
And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner, but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto, and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used. 
And you need some design to be successful. 
Harvest witness, smoke. 
And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective. 
(Laughter) The nerds here, they get laid -- except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket -- and you say to yourself at some point, "Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?" 
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle, peace, justice and equality, but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. 
And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. 
You might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this. 
It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant. 
Language represents specific stages in our lives, and terminology that is linked to our emotions. 
KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before -- a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die," sort of sense of existence. 
To Svalbard, in fact. 
They found something called Facebook. 
In playing this toy, you kind of -- this will bring up philosophical questions in you. 
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful. 
SP: But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral? 
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything. 
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century. 
(Laughter) And this is by Cicily Bennett, and it's from a series of short films. 
Thank you. 
That is our river. 
I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape. 
And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through. 
If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves. 
This is actually a patient who [was] presented with a deceased organ, and we then created one of these smart biomaterials, and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. 
But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17, there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt. 
It died in large part because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder traction. 
They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy. 
Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here. 
Almost nobody gets out of love alive. 
How do you design that nozzle? 
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows. 
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from. 
You really have to do work to figure out, well, one option's a thousand, 2,000; one is 1,500. 
The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, "How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?" 
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them. 
♫ Don't understand you ♫ ♫ Don't understand you ♫ ♫ I turn around ♫ ♫ See the sound ♫ ♫ Turn around and see the thing ♫ ♫ that made the sound. ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ Mysterious whisper ♫ ♫ The day that love came to play. ♫ ♫ I'm having a heart attack ♫ ♫ I'm having a heart attack ♫ ♫ I'm having a heart attack ♫ ♫ I'm having a ... ♫ ♫ Fingertips ♫ ♫ Fingertips ♫ ♫ I walk along darkened corridors ♫ ♫ And I walk along darkened corridors ♫ 
The study of dinosaurs may, literally, one day save the planet. 
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago, I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply. 
It's not like the teddy bear. 
I want to close with a quick little video. 
I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East; something different is happening. 
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae. 
We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas, and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit. 
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five, as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. 
Thank you. 
During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media, now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster. 
So, what's the future? 
There is even, most beautifully of all, a "Report this item" button. 
I had a 24-karat gold ring. 
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. 
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question. 
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done. 
We don't know why, but we do. 
Vaccines were promised to developing countries. 
And so I just -- I hope we all dream well. 
Amazing thing, those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart. 
So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted, and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome. 
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. 
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. 
So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. 
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success. 
And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point. 
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is." 
My true love lives up the river; a few more jumps and I'll be with her. 
In an unprecedented fit of generosity -- and you have to be very suspicious about these people -- in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully — unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors. 
But what if they were poems and psalms? 
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true. 
There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. 
CA: So there's so many things playing into this. 
But it turns out, if you look into research on people's mindset, that caring about outcomes, caring about public recognition, caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long-term psychological well-being. 
And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same, about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal, or renewables that are more or less centralized. 
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. 
So they are now sending the character back into that world. 
And it was snowing that day. 
It is not just technological, it is social innovation that we talk about. 
(Applause) Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine. 
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside. 
"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. 
I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way. 
And now, if you're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics, these are the ones that should do it. 
LD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world, (Laughter) we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage. 
And our cities are going to be at risk too, because a lot of these are coastal cities. 
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist. 
And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections, or hospital-acquired infections, this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices. 
And we've heard those things about "is it nurture or is it nature," right? 
So, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952, which happened to be the year of my birth. 
For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys. 
I think there are signs of hope. 
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments? 
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes. 
(Music and singing "Lickih nehu") (Music ends) And in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions. 
And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou, talking about something that is very dear to him, which is the accidents of life. 
Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root." 
In fact, without the optimism bias, we would all be slightly depressed. 
And if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. 
No, I hire a student and mentor him, teach him how to think about the problem, to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose. 
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left -- (Laughter) with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto. 
Since I was a student, I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. 
So these brief examples that I've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to bring together, arts, science and engineering into a new age of math, science and art. 
And two tens. 
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. 
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant, and most of the organism is overhead, unseen. 
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in what are to our eyes an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. 
Thank you very much indeed. 
It's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. 
All of us can see it. All of us understand this. 
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change, but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. 
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses. 
I'm still excited by technology, but I believe, and I'm here to make the case, that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go. 
She looked at me, and she said, "You're exactly the person I need to talk to. 
You're all being intelligent right now, but you're not doing anything. 
And most of them did so without using birth control. 
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits. 
So this is what we've been working on, and this is what our prosthetic does. 
And on the 21st of September this year, we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process, to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities. 
Given the access to technology, even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board. 
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. 
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven. 
(Thumping) Now it's gone. 
And everybody says, "A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one." 
Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays, and almost all of that is done in the language domain. 
And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America." 
I love this because it looks so easy. 
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [unclear] by doing things differently. 
Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16. 
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience. 
So just finally, cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. 
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds, or 10 kilograms. 
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. 
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay? 
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like? 
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. 
It's not a joke yet; those aren't the jokes. 
Attention is the currency. 
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. 
The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. 
I'm referring to how immigrants, when they come to these neighborhoods, they begin to alter the one-dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems, as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage, or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family. 
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again, as we've just continued to sprawl, and they now have a relatively central location. 
Could this be done? 
Here's some data that we collected through our company with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them, in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees, and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape, for even that matter, and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is. 
And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice. 
BG: That's an editor taking responsibility. 
You don't know that. 
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea. 
You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels. 
You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles, you're swimming at 60 strokes a minute, so you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well. 
We have this non-zero-sum relationship, and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you're more likely to cut them a break. 
Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. 
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. 
On the left you have Edward Witten. 
Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. 
And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff. 
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book. 
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions, and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer, talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless? 
They're really kindred disciplines. 
It leaves their children paralyzed, and it drags their families deeper into poverty, because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have, trying in vain to find a cure for their children. 
Now, I have this device on. 
This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country. 
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. 
Okay, good. 
It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments. 
going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way. 
I'll get your postman making dinner plans. 
But you have to fight for your self-determination today. 
(Applause) Because of what I'm about to say, I really should establish my green credentials. 
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there." 
I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational, but I remain radically rational, whatever that is. 
When we talk about power transition, we often talk about the rise of Asia. 
My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. 
He says, "This is the gesture of the music. 
It's called "All the Answers." 
And we're all acutely aware: what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket, when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free? 
You get your board certificate, and you can go out into practice. 
And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat, OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well. 
"You didn't shave.""But sir —" "No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. 
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof. 
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music, within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine. 
And then not only humans. 
In a primitive and simple world, there's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality. 
We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. 
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years. 
So what they're doing, let's see, something like that, so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they're generating it into a phrase. 
(Applause) But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines. 
It was so tragic. 
And I'm already off-message. 
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly about this issue. 
So, for instance, there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant, that the baby will not have HIV when it's born. 
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer, it assumes you are human, and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly. 
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. 
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago. 
Now, here's a piece of chalk. 
And that's something that's just profound and sad, but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this. 
This is what William said: "Never heard me before." 
And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. 
The second thing that this generation needs to do is to create our institutions. 
And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much, much simpler way. 
They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not. 
But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism. 
And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other, they have totally different physiology. 
This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. 
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles. 
I don't know what the answer is to that. 
Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago. 
Let me tell you about Saima. 
And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise, and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us, and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. 
I'm still breaking the silence today. 
You want to help. You want to fix. 
But over the past year or so, researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance. 
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller. 
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed. 
And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. 
(Laughter) I felt this was one of the more successful solutions. 
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent. 
But a typical Hans Rosling graph: think for a moment, not what it shows, but think instead about what it leaves out. 
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me. 
As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance. 
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. 
So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals. 
If you're leaning forward, he will try and slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face, because we went out with this strong idea: how can we make you believe that something's real? 
We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. 
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards, throw up rooster tails. 
And then you can highlight it into something like, yes, CouchSurfing.org. 
However, acting majors are not supposed to act. 
You had to concentrate a whole lot. 
I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. 
Yeah well, you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round, a nice round shape. 
Or should we use something else? 
Now we're experiencing one every week. 
Because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted, and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it, create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement. 
They just pass through anything. 
Along with outward development and increase of opportunity, there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. 
In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans who are unable to speak, and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate. 
(Applause) As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible, standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights, so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper, and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done. 
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. 
Life is a right, not collateral or casual. 
It was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five French strangers. 
And so, that decision to work with his friends -- now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started. 
And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government, and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight, and I pushed Enter, and it came back and said "obese." 
So what is an insect seeing? 
It's how we've built it that's really unique. 
It's a very wuzzy line. 
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it, Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature. 
Let me show you what these people do. 
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts. 
The second challenge was cells. 
Today, we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men. 
That can be very embarrassing. 
This is about my friend Brennan. 
And then for a real beginner, you would go down even further and elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out, open the door, don't leave it open too long, put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever. 
(Laughter) They said, "Why have you put it there?" 
So as I go around the world, I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off. 
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray. 
They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk-related behaviors. 
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that. 
One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this, is actually increasing. 
This is the guy who started the project in my lab, and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff. 
And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. 
Yeah, I'm Harry. 
So click responsibly. Thank you. 
Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. 
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart. 
And the basis of the fetus' prediction is what its mother eats. 
So he's saying, "I've got this problem." 
New word. 
The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet, so those invoices don't get issued. 
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. 
I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA. 
So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. 
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different, deductive method. 
So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. 
Well maybe so. But I don't think so. 
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended." 
But you see, the question is this: If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money, it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars. 
That doesn't seem terribly shocking -- although it's controversial for a lot of people -- that we are self-interested. 
Then one day, a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms. 
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. 
And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal, a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in. 
How did they treat my parents? 
For kids growing up, that skill is the bedrock of development. 
CA: Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that, because you're regularly putting your life at risk. 
(Laughter) And I'd also like to say that the irony of course, is that denying girl, suppressing girl, suppressing emotion, refusing feeling has lead thus here. 
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk. 
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards. 
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself. 
Three of the key people in this project, Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. 
And there's the first little cam that drove Furby. 
The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story. 
And at a point in time, he got so engrossed in the whole challenge, that he himself became a member of the team. 
It's put inside the computer. 
It's so complicated. 
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end towards which all other things aim. 
So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face, offline or online, and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. 
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology. 
We developed these novel actuators for joints. 
Even more worrying for the Americans, in December 2008 the holiest of holies, the IT systems of CENTCOM, the central command managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these: plain but infected USB keys. 
They could point at the visual object, or they could mimic the whistle. 
BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield, this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it, which is our heat shield. 
Elegant. 
So I didn't think much about it. 
I can go literally anywhere in the world, I think since I was already in Ecuador, I just decided to click on the word "tropical." 
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. 
There are more people dying of simple things. 
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants. 
Video games are a symptom. 
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life, and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life." 
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways. 
Day to day, I watched women being carried to a graveyard, or watched children going to a graveyard. 
It reminds us that we know we can do better. 
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. 
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened. 
Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. 
And they all treat learning, not as some sort of academic, analytical activity, but as that's something that's productive, something you make, something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from. 
They may feel confident, say, in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. 
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York, and my dream job, but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate, so I agreed, and I quit my job, and Conor and I left Manhattan together. 
But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do -- was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. 
They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities -- are mobilizing them on behalf of the state. 
It's wireless. It's always connected. 
It's not software. 
Here he is: (Video) Prince Manvendra: I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society. 
They had her scanned inside out. 
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. 
And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent. 
Okay? (Laughter) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. 
What is New Yorker humor? 
Ultimately, especially now in this world, where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws, in reality TV that thrives on humiliation, and in a context of analysis, where the thing we hear most repeatedly, day-in, day-out in the United States, in every train station, every bus station, every plane station is, "Ladies and gentlemen, please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you," when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. 
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues who've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many, many, many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis. 
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear, that was the noise. 
(Laughter) Also, from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest. 
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen, they eat, and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish. 
(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here. 
And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions, then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care. 
Now you can try to move your outcomes around. 
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968. 
Companies can even give control to hackers. 
Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good. 
And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left. 
There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy. 
And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness, you know how challenging it can be. 
He was an actor. You saw him act. 
That the place where, during an earthquake in 1954, this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly, and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. 
(Applause) So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw. 
So if you want recipes to work -- for virtually anything -- health, education, government politics and education -- you have to go to these places. 
If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks, which is the standard, about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. 
Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya, the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located, and the darker the shade of green, the more the number of out-of-school children. 
Thank you. 
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language, they have biochemistry. 
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you're all so young. 
I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart. 
Significant problems remained. 
I took a couple victory laps in there. 
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz." 
FW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah. 
It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people. 
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies. 
I said, "No. 
And when you put them together, something magical happens, something absolutely incredible happens, and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. 
Deworming. 
Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world. 
And these are everyday conventions, conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. 
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee, and drinking everybody's water at the table, and I think they all thought I was a druggie. 
I have to take a moment. 
But individuals with severe depression, they have a pessimistic bias. 
Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world. 
We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things. 
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. 
Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines. 
But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me, aside from her very existence, is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden, the community of disabled people. 
56 percent of all rape cases don't result. 
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms. 
The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. 
Again, a push, now this time from the front. 
We can do what we need to do, but it will take every entrepreneur, every artist, every scientist, every communicator, every mother, every father, every child, every one of us. 
No movement, no growth. 
Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo. 
Microsoft is doing something wonderful. 
As a kid, I was obsessed with space. 
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. 
Now, the academics in this audience may think, "Well, that sounds like plagiarism." 
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells, broke them open, and compared their gene sequences. 
(Applause) Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything. 
You don't choose the spoken word. 
The most effective bow for me would be like this. 
And the informal level -- I learned about people, and what we do and how we are. 
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies, how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. 
That changed my life quite dramatically, and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers. 
And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps, but it's also about our children as well. 
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities. 
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. 
It has moments of experience, one after the other. 
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight. 
We end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them, where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know. 
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. 
The difference between our nachos and the other guy's nachos, is that this is actually a dessert. 
Now here's an interesting comparison. 
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. 
This has never made much sense to me, this argument. 
And the candle wax was dirty, and we couldn't image through the wax. 
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me. 
These never really caught on either: the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. 
In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. 
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. 
For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling -- to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder. 
Many rooms are not so good. 
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin. 
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building: every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood. 
And why is the physiology different? 
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it. 
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect, but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women, because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. 
But he was still going like this. 
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale. 
And then she turned to me and said, "And you know what those young actors did? 
It's great to be a kid. 
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. 
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things, we will take a very big step in that direction. 
Well the problem with that is that it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years. 
This is a song that came out of that. 
And the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers of Google snacks. 
I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread," and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture. 
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice? 
It is absolutely true. 
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. 
Just for a minute, imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap. 
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music, I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water. 
Because it's about surveillance. 
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time. 
Let me start again. 
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. 
I find this extremely important, because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions. 
BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist, and to me, it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis, Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story, which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility, but how did you sell it to your editors? 
NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that. 
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer, which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm. 
And institutions can learn from this. 
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time? 
Drinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage. 
For the first time in human history, talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. 
That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries, and new, unexpected phenomena. 
In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years. 
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that. 
One is about the war in the Middle East, and another one is about a public demonstration in France. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, even by the police's admission, this makes not a dent in the profits, really, of the major exporters. 
It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg. 
And you can run your script through there, and they can tell you, quantifiably, that that's a 30 million dollar movie or a 200 million dollar movie. 
Women in Uganda this year, who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day, actually evoked the wrath of the government. 
The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge. 
Teacher: And then, have you got it again? 
It lived for up to 42 years, and this bat's still alive in the wild today. 
(Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. 
But remember, Greece is there today. 
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. 
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family. 
These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment. 
This is Kylie, her sister, who's now a doctor, on the right. 
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. 
In 1993, there was a table at the conference in Seattle, and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web. 
But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects. 
CS: The barrel of the gun! 
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. 
The colors show the continent. 
Okay, so how do we understand this? 
And I thought, "This is what we need, as a language." 
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women. 
If you have extreme diseases, you need to get extreme remedies. 
And what does it mean? 
In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected. 
These same infections create harmful algal blooms. 
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work. 
Find other people reading those books. 
Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us, the infidelity of a parent or spouse, money inherited? 
But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects, can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend. 
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.) So I decided, kind of told myself, "Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter) Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months, so I was like, what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar, and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers. 
It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room. 
He was a man of tremendous leadership. 
I was actually crying during his presentation. 
I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from? 
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T," the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day. 
We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being, and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate, so personal. 
And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them, prison is their only destination. 
The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators, and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this. 
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons, something interesting happens. 
And what's really happened over the period of time that I've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then. 
Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. 
Champion sounds so goofy, but it's what it was, right? 
The best way to describe it is, I share therefore I am. 
And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. 
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together, and so we can look at spots. 
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose, ideas for maybe how to do that. 
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. 
Why? 
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room. 
This is a tense moment in the first football game, I think. 
What are you going to do? 
Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her "like new" copy of "Sex and the City" for my copy of "24." 
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy. 
You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract. 
That's a 2,000 mile journey. 
What shapes are the trees? 
(Applause) We do not invest in victims, we invest in survivors. 
The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated. 
(Applause) So if you've been following the news, you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States, all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years. 
Today, what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers. 
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. 
And absolutely -- I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy, dollars spent in restaurants or on parking, at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes, the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. 
And with a mobile phone, you can record a song, load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. 
So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of "digital humanists" that are going to be ready for this shift. 
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years. 
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop. 
There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down. 
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County, because that's where her family is from, where she calls home, and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. 
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force. 
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels, one paper towel per person per day, 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used. 
Let's go to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this, that's fine, just tell us, we will take you home. We love you no matter what.'" And she says, "So I went the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration, and I looked around and I just knew I couldn't do it. 
And I speak, but this is an amazing audience, and what am I doing here? 
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms. 
Now, there are less than 10,000, and family support services are provided across the country. 
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we? 
Thank you very much. 
We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that. 
And when I returned it looked like this. 
(Applause) I wanted to be a rock star. 
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather. 
And so, the year 2000, you see there. 
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove. 
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it. 
I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there. 
And so seven stars would stand for "elu meen," which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. 
They're going to -- They are very threatened in the United States of America alone. 
Thank you. 
If there's tension in the village, if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent, the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says, "Shake hands. 
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect. 
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle. 
It has sensors. 
Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. 
Because after all, the ban on women in combat was still very much in place. 
OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK. 
They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well. 
Heroes: How do we view leadership? 
That's about a 50th of a millimeter. 
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. 
(Laughter) Thank you. 
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger, because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. 
And the following morning, my mother came to explain that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room, that I'd been working in film and television and that I had been in a crash and that, yes, I was married, but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash. 
And that's really where interaction lies, and that's the importance of interaction. 
And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes. 
That black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste. 
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. 
So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor. 
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. 
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. 
This is of new infections. 
And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen, that helps. 
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded. 
And you start to see things. 
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other. 
As it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization, it has driven us toward moral truth. 
And so she must have taken the ferry over. 
And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe. 
Now the largest economic region in the world. 
There's a wave about to crash onto him. 
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. 
And what that means is that it's not dormant -- it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. 
So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion, but at the end of the day, religions are so subtle, so complicated, so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone; they're for all of us. 
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces. 
John Edward, Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators. 
And the base of the building is again about public space. 
Once again, most of that doesn't get paid. 
Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it, but we eat them. 
And what is their predominant concern? 
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call "passive observation." 
I'm performing for you. 
A lack of oxygen in the water. 
I see it in our business leaders. 
So here's a list of problems that come up. 
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. 
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. 
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. 
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant. (Applause) (Applause) Okay? And then if we want, we can continue the scroll to find out, for example, on the staircase, the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple, and there are a lot of figures showing up. See? 
(Laughter) Indeed, it is discouraging. 
And I wondered, what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places, where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms? 
What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -- phoniness, false sophistication, jargon. 
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural. 
And I thought, "No way, no way." 
It doesn't even have a lawyer present. 
And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA from a small group of people, and in a matter of weeks, we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country. 
We all use Wikipedia. 
You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought. 
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. 
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. 
By the time it lands, they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. 
We're doing 12 cities for China right now, based on cradle to cradle as templates. 
This disconnect was never actually resolved. 
And we do have such a tool. 
And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. 
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. 
In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture. 
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. 
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. 
DR: Yeah, surprising. 
(Applause) He's actually here today. 
Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles -- a swarm of little particles." 
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences. 
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. 
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not. 
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders, we need Bricklayers Without Borders, to rebuild the skill set. 
So, he didn't really want to say anything. 
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling. 
Now, a dolphin, mother dolphin, any dolphin -- there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin. 
That's my feeling. 
The easiest target was the peace process, and now the Iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite, and Iran began supporting extensively Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously had shunned. 
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries. 
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep. 
The quality of advice was identical. 
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals. 
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. 
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa. 
Hooked it up to my laptop, and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank. 
That's what John Keats is doing in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem. 
It's already halfway over, but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care. 
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff, the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth. 
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here." 
When I visited them a few years ago, what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early. 
Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now. 
A single strand dipped in water that completely self-folds on its own into the letters M I T. 
It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. 
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs and tenacity alone. 
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death. 
(Applause) I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation, which is what drove me then, and still, it's a delusion that drives me now. 
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'" He looked quietly at me and said, "You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work." 
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success. 
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that. 
I don't research what's killing the bees, per se. 
CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. 
There was dignity in defeat. 
They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border, they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool, because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you. 
Behind each of the million children in institutions, there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova, who only had enough money to feed her baby, and so had to send her older son to the institution; or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children at home until her husband died, but then she had to go out to work full time, and with no support, felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents 
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected. 
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. 
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. 
Thank you very much. 
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying, inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way. 
So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. 
What is this?" 
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation. 
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer. 
Seven. 
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did. 
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. 
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist, but they were great. 
(Laughter) Still juggling. (Laughter) Impossible, you say? 
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. 
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on. 
The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day. 
The patient's cut open, twice. 
Come here. Come here. Come here. 
It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. 
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know. 
And I had my vision restored, but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position. 
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, "Listen, you've got to join choir. 
I took more than my body had to offer. 
(Laughter) So here are 12 dinosaurs. 
If I were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. 
Individuals unite into a team, a movement or a nation, which is far more than the sum of its parts. 
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. 
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions, and took a number of set photographs, and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures. 
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services. 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. 
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much, I thought, "I'll go out for a run." 
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. 
That's all this project was about, about restoring those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back. 
Secondly, different types of pivots. 
AT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us, it's about the future of these children. 
So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being. 
Here's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers, for governing people, for economists, for scientists. 
And actually 700 and change million cars today emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2. 
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople, are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those. 
And so, you know, for example, with these devices, patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges, not very much more, so nothing close to normal vision has been possible. 
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS, at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions, read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. 
CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work and you've taught us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before. 
And one of the lessons we've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth. 
And I hadn't even thought about that. 
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community. 
Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. 
There's an environmental component. 
The navigation is difficult. 
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic, and be really, really quick. 
Why? This is a real mystery. 
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well, too, with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart, and when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in, I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. 
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. 
And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex. 
Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain. 
It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out. 
And if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company, you can see that written up in this week's edition of PLOS Medicine. 
Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying, as they should be, for a pioneering city. 
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead? 
While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough. 
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning, but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin. 
Being generous to concentrating solar power, I think it's perfect credible it could deliver 20 watts per square meter. So that's nice. 
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately, but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four. 
Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. 
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word? 
Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is daily wage earners, mostly landless, are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and plumbers. 
Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a view port. 
Only sometimes. Only sometimes. 
Rather than what we think that they might need. 
These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up. 
So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, there, where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open, you throw your laundry down. 
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff. 
Before YouTube, there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential, because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right? 
Maybe it's a problem of the political culture, and we have to think about how to change that political culture." 
I'm biased. 
So what will happen now is quite straightforward. 
We will know that we're not that miracle, right, that we're just another duck in a row, we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. 
Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it, and I love the mud on my legs and feet. 
This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network, is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid. 
There's a lot more to come. 
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it. 
And it even got better. 
And here in my chart -- on the left-hand side is where we are now. 
And that may not sound very intuitive, but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers. 
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now. 
I didn't give up, and there was action behind these words. 
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle? 
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you. 
So, I'm going to challenge all of you. 
That was the job. 
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things. 
So to sum up: language is a collective human creation, reflecting human nature, how we conceptualize reality, how we relate to one another. 
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future. 
Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. 
We all are creative people. 
And similarly, there were many other things, many other practices. 
So, I went. 
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. 
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. 
Suddenly, this appeared. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. 
(Applause) Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse. 
And this is what it is. 
And still, you may not see the branches. 
They don't see the little, tiny sign that says: "Stay out of the water." 
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more. 
(Music) In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame. 
You know, they're just not going to get it. 
Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up, they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency, down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks, all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention. 
It said, actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many of those women. 
Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing. 
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?" 
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus. 
So here, if you look at this poster, it has all the trappings of Western culture. 
Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context. 
Tom: I'm Tom. 
And so, this stuff is like battery acid. 
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds, it's a false premise. 
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas. 
Now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century, we find a new style of technology. 
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common. 
So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. 
(Laughter) That's the difference. 
We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. 
And then that was it. 
How do you fix a price for a player? 
Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make. 
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker, because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against. 
And you even find a church. 
Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted? 
And this groove right here, comes from the Crescent City, the old second line. 
So you have what's called the xenon pit, and so some of these fission products love neutrons. 
Thanks. 
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered? 
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy. 
It's a very violent process that is little known. 
And when I love my servant," God says, "I become the eyes by which he or she sees, the ears by which he or she listens, the hand by which he or she grasps, and the foot by which he or she walks, and the heart by which he or she understands." 
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives, of the things that they value and care about. 
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. 
If it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae, I would certainly think. 
And you've got to get better, and better, and better, and better. 
Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great! 
Turn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem. 
I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers, I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda. 
I had more supplies lower down, which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. 
We're smitten with technology. 
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant. 
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, "I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. 
But what you are buying now is great." 
These are stars being born out of here. 
All right. 
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will. 
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained. 
And number two: does this theory really work in detail, when you try to apply it to the world around us? 
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none. 
So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV. 
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science, obviously biology, obviously astronomy, but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of, "We're looking for E.T." 
And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface. 
After a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready to give up, but he has an epiphany one day. 
His intent is to be funny. 
Why good bugs? 
Information spreads in populations, norms can spread in populations, behaviors can spread in populations. 
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. 
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions. 
A simple volume, the cube. 
My father has been a poacher for quite a long time. 
For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. 
So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues. Right? 
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine, and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum. 
And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world, I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that. 
Elio Caccavale: he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. 
My name is Theresa Battles. 
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me? 
(Applause) A couple of quick factoids; it really took 155 people over two years, and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut. 
I suggest that real equality, full equality, does not just mean valuing women on male terms. 
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. 
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?" 
So it's a little bit unexpected, but, in a way, it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents, which is in itself a form of honor. 
The next day, all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island, where he was going to give a conference to the world's press, standing in front of his former prison cell. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 
Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities, they were also exploring physical objects. 
Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills. 
is very painful. 
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that, you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens right here in the United States every single year. 
But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history. 
But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet. 
Now the new Global Goals are explicitly universal. 
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag. 
And that is how this difference has come. 
And then when he won the general election, he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet. 
So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia. 
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. 
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics, complete with solar power generators, good lab technology. 
It's not only the forms of cities, but the fact that they incarnate emotions, not just of those who build them, but of those who live there as well. 
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs, and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that these people, instead of dismissing their fears, these people read them closely, they studied them, and then they translated that fear into preparation and action. 
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles. 
Horses' hearing is very important. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up. 
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw. 
The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive, is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible. 
We can, for example, go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. 
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. 
They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. 
Takes just under a minute to work out that it’s because of the way that he slept. 
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said. 
It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. 
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. 
And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. 
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles. 
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul. 
A well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. 
What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. 
I am banking on you and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something. 
I said, "Okay." 
And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. 
And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time, to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. 
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing." 
As the years go by, I hold back my tears, because if I cry I'd give in to fear. 
He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back. 
Use of freshwater. 
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs. 
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is, and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time. 
(Laughter) So I began to realize, by the end of this course, that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain. 
I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment. 
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years, and here comes the Internet, technology, BlackBerry, SMS. 
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned. 
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband, and this was a sequence of images. 
It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG. 
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. 
Some who understood the project would explain it to others. 
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. 
We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code. 
"Make no mistake about it," he said, "these women are warriors, and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the United States Army." 
So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons, and what we must address. 
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages? 
And that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account. 
And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline. 
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. 
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax, going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period. 
Good. 
And you can see here, there are a lot of them. 
How much depends on how lucky you are. 
And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion, I didn't find it amazing; I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments in my 15 years of work. 
Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people. 
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to. 
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. 
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head. 
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. 
In order to break down our barriers, we have to learn to talk to people, to demand that people work on translation. 
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles, whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle, isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle, if you've got that misconception in your head, then that two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses. 
Here's another example. 
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them -- this is amazing. 
In fact, we were the only people in the universe. 
There is a place where you can. 
But is it really true to itself? 
We can call this place in Congo a death camp, because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation. 
I don't want to know all the ins and outs, and the gazuntas and the yaddas and stuff. 
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. 
I thought, "What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral?" 
50th percentile female frame. 
Evan. Okay. 
Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted, 50 percent goes in their house account, 50 percent goes in their toy account. 
It'll dim. 
So no water is stored. It's always on tap. 
For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore. 
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time. 
America today is a sprightly young body, hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side, while leaving the other worryingly perfect. 
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. 
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. 
And indeed that's exactly what stars do. 
I'm going to show you our latest dataset. 
Man: Let's go. 
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out," and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme, and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint. (Laughter) So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist. 
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. 
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. 
Well, it's not the war on terror. 
At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way. 
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers. 
MK: I can help you. 
I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. 
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. 
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there? 
He can read a novel or two a day. 
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter) "You'll get it!" he said. 
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we? 
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question. 
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. 
She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder. 
And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?" 
CA: Wow. So, most people, if you ask them what are they most passionate about, they'd say things like, "My kids" or "My lover." 
I live in New York now. Just this week, posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage. 
It's called the vegetative soul, because they lack movement, and so they don't need to sense. 
And it serves you the 404 page. 
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading. 
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now -- I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that, and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this. 
And that's where about half of our drugs come. 
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go. 
It's not a bug. 
It's the hollowing out of small towns. 
RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. 
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated. 
So I had to convince everybody. 
So can you read it? 
Every few minutes, the video pauses and the students get asked a question. 
Well, it means if it were united in a single political system, one country, call it "The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R., or "Bazaaristan," it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year, and that would make it the second largest economy in the world, after the United States. 
I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. 
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. 
(Applause) All buildings today have something in common. 
It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma, but you don't need charisma to become a leader. 
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. 
And the answer is really straightforward: They are lost forever. 
But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so. 
Let's do the reflection in X first, followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. 
People see each other behaving. 
And something very, very nice happens. 
So that it was something that just got into your spirit. 
Americans are about 50/50, whether they're Democrats or Republicans. 
And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. 
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer, and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here -- is filled with iridium. 
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. 
(Applause) So I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust. 
They behave with a swarm behavior, where they relate to each other, modeled after insect swarm behavior, and they could be made very numerous. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq? 
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy, while another group of pregnant women drank only water. 
Let me put this bluntly. 
And I thought a lot about, What was my daughter's life going to be like without me? 
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply, if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. 
And in these times of change, we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete. 
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to." 
We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. 
The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic, and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. 
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design. 
and he wanted to get the data. 
What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment. 
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting. 
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves. 
And you can do more than just insects. 
I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. 
We don't need a media company to help do this for us. 
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP. 
It was called Talibanization. 
What we need in this space are strong data and analytics. 
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy, and cannot wish not to be so. 
(Applause) So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. 
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe. 
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do. 
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. 
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz, it's two. 
A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time. 
Where there is no trust, the music quite simply withers away. 
In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine. 
Thank you. 
But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts, it looks like that. 
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma; in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma. 
And some things look very familiar today. 
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they're taking or taking too little risk, we need to think about that. 
But a lot of times in Hollywood, when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent, they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great. 
Since 2001, we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people -- young and old, men and women, educated and illiterate. 
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone. 
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own. 
20 years ago, no one had heard of it. 
He's going to think I'm not working hard." 
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. 
Where you are now, all of a sudden, sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems, and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen? 
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products. 
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay? 
So one answer was George Clooney. 
But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. 
Here's my favorite design moment: In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s, I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire, who raped and pillaged that country. 
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets. 
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example. 
But mostly what you need to know, to find out if you're sick, is not your predispositions, but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. 
CC: I can't do that, son. 
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming. 
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact, wild and now protected -- entirely protected -- in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park. 
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way. 
Over time we got a little bit better at it, and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff. 
And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. 
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. 
(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters. 
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet -- and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing, which also goes back to Turing, who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless, little, finite state machine, just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. 
OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation. 
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated. 
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible. 
People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way, to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time. 
It's just that, whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light, your language relies on pulses, discrete pulses, of sound. 
(Laughter) That is how innovation happens. 
A history of at least 2,000 years, a history of conquest, occupation, absorption, assimilation and so on, led to the process by which, over time, this notion of the Han emerged -- of course, nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. 
But I really like it, it feels right. 
I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear. 
But first, compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. 
One, you can make people actually secure and hope they notice. 
It's just completely different. 
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this. 
And even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain. 
(Laughter) And in those days, I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. 
And the thing is, it's not just big industry. 
But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail. 
Because you know, some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician, when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this. Let me change. (Music) Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, 
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane -- the materials that help us, when we're hit like this, not to hurt ourselves too much. 
It's also important to think about what the benefit is. 
Now, another thing is the sensory issues. 
This is what runs everything around us. 
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger. 
I was given a slap in the face reading a book, "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. 
Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix, we could just put them together in one good photo, and remake the whole photo. 
It's for your own immediate use. 
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa, in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back. 
He told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing. 
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands. 
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment, and we prepaid them. 
First, don't become a cannibal. 
Now let's look at another part of the world, the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans. 
This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water, carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. 
And these people were pouring into my office. 
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. 
We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me. 
You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?" 
We have engineers, we have cell biologists, we have clinicians, all working together. 
People have tried very hard to do this. 
The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes. 
Okay, so that's all you have, eyes that weren't really designed for this task, but then people ask you to do things like, you want to make a lane change, what's the first thing they ask you do? 
This is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment. 
And he was such an extraordinary man. 
I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys. 
In Africa, because you didn't have these cities, you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation. 
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community. 
It's a horse head, that's right. 
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. 
We work with a fourth technology. 
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this. 
(Laughter) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. 
And the real question is, what lessons did we learn? 
As a high-schooler, I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey, and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world. 
And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. 
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular. 
That's a subject that we want to dive into. 
And I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label," and all that happy worker crap. 
So the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process. 
Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic, it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard. 
I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them. 
And then it would be too late to act. 
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV. 
You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all. 
And this is the shape that evolved. 
(Laughter) A good friend. 
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says, "He tells me, he tells me, before he passed, that he had trouble breathing." 
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated, depending on whose statistics you're looking at. 
Still here, child death per 1,000 on that axis. 
These are organized chronologically. 
That makes a good cartoon. 
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros. 
And in fact we can make fusion happen. 
If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin. 
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it, but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man." 
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. 
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from? 
I mean, frankly, I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue. 
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated. 
Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables. 
We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. 
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles. 
Those things really exist. 
And that's going to keep happening. 
But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. 
You could apply the same principle actually, if you like, to the security lanes in airports. 
It's kind of a well-kept secret. 
And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general, and they never expected any generals in the family, as long as you got an education and then you got a job. 
So I'll just give you an example from my lab. 
Socially motivated investors: there's an interesting idea, right? 
These were the bad projects. 
JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram, and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead, although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. 
So, will we find the whole of physics? 
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake. 
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street. 
But the really interesting thing about it is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. 
And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech. 
Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film. 
So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. 
We'd like to tell our story better, and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective. 
Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils, like Charles Darwin, for example, or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley, who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen. 
And I find this very much disturbing when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong with democracy these days. 
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity, as well as an enormous social problem. 
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license — oh my God -- (Laughter) — we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do, and that's also reminiscent of ADHD, which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine. 
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. 
It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users. 
Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself: dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable, and finally allowed to break free from the frame. 
We need to put money where it can productively grow. 
No to stripping the people, and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads, "Long live a peaceful revolution," because we will never retaliate with violence. 
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals. 
But now we've narrowed the streets, highly landscaped them, making them more pedestrian-friendly, really a redesign, rethinking the way we build our infrastructure, designing a city around people and not cars. 
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. 
And then we scrutinize them, logically and with data. 
is a constant. When the frequency goes up, the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up, frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here -- over here, that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up, things get closer, pitch goes down, things stretch out. 
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. 
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way. 
I'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower-lying countries. 
He will not be pleased. 
That's the idea. 
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. 
Can we find a solution to produce more? 
So at this point, music diverged. 
(Laughter) It's a short introductory part. 
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. 
The first is: Are cities part of biology? 
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind. 
So what we've got is a situation. 
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury, and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. 
And that communication, that connectivity around the world, that globalization now raises a burden. 
Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it. 
So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com, let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you, to help make the world richer, fairer, cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. 
(Laughter) They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is. 
I'd already served in Germany, Norway, various other places, but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. 
But they came up with a book, looking back at 13 years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. 
This is an ecological network. 
Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising, David Sarnoff commercializes radio. 
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms. 
It's the bridge over the Drina River, the subject of a novel by Ivo Andrić, and it talks about how, in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans, over time there's been enormous building of walls. 
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name; it's just the two of us standing there. 
Then the old will die. 
So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume, without deciding, that James Somerset was indeed a legal person, and he issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. 
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words -- not normal -- a different strategy, by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants. 
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.' If you make that an option rather than the default, you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking, and they do it three times as often." 
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. 
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. 
Sickness, health, tender violence. 
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better." 
Okay, here it is. 
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people. 
Some are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve. 
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk, Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row. 
It's twice the size of Australia, a continent that is the same size as China and India put together. 
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. 
Well, by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability. 
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology: using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old, old technology called "domestication." 
(Applause) I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. 
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you. 
To explain what this means and what this thing is, please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. 
And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. 
And so they had a ready supply of converts. 
Now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67-percent drop in shootings and killings in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago. 
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone, and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take, and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. 
As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe, they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. 
Well it allowed you to do that. 
They are both right now on the run. 
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy. 
But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. 
We started with, you can take it off in the office. 
First of all, translating the Web. 
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. 
But let's take the idea further. 
As Eric Schmidt said, "It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them." 
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. 
They will fall into black holes. 
And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues. 
I'm a bit of a health nut. 
Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere? 
This was actually the experiment. So you can see the coils were somewhat larger. 
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior. 
Don't think you don't trust me anymore. 
(Laughter) Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that. 
A break of light and air, an architectural biding of time. 
But, in fact, if you have cell phones, you can now go to this nice lady who's somewhere like Namibia, and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT, she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way. 
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production, to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. 
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them. 
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire. 
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. 
On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856. 
Well our patients have to use very code-y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs. 
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. 
My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All," and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending. 
White is the synthesis. 
What happened? 
The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of "24." 
You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. 
What am I doing? Why would I do this?" 
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. 
Help us tell the story. 
It's a geometric language. 
Four hours into the deployment, we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time. 
And there are two key things it's got to do. 
I think in our minds we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle, say, "Oh, little bottle. 
We the children had gathered at a friend's house. 
In a major article published in 1978, Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York described a model to understand how conflicts could arise. 
I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub, like Grand Central or Penn Station, right next to some of the other, actual vending machines in that location. 
You could still buy the music, but you couldn't hear anything because it had been silenced. 
The first of these is natural selection -- that's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. 
That year she introduced me to dance, and thus began my tryst with classical dance. 
(Laughter) The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection" A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway, serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit. 
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet. 
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job. 
I don't know if my parents really believe that, but I didn't want to prove them wrong. 
They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty. 
And "done this before" is starting an enterprise and creating value, and taking something from beginning to end. 
And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. 
We don't claim to have the answers, but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues, such as race, gun control, the refugee debate, relationship between Islam and terrorism. 
We kill about 100 million sharks a year. 
He put it on a personal basis. 
And it's the process of learning things. 
Like you've heard the other economists say, we are at the point where China was when its boom years began, and that's where we're going. 
Here we go. (Laughter) This little baby has a lot of horsepower. 
This is not about money. 
And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well. 
So, this sounds really crazy, right? 
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits. 
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick, just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. 
It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. 
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. 
We're understanding the software programs that make our body run. 
I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt. 
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms. 
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. 
So you have the prefrontal cortex here, lighting up in red. 
He came out of nowhere. 
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now. 
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. 
This shape is of an extraordinary complication. 
Something really weird is going on here. 
And every single one of you, every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment. 
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years. 
One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me what was I doing, and I explained. 
And they redid that building. 
So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice. 
That's the first time I've ever played it. 
None at all. 
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky! 
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down. 
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. 
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. 
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off. 
What does this mean? 
We were to be below the radar, so there was no communication, really, between Bageye and us and us and Bageye, and the sound that we most looked forward to, you know when you're a child and you want your father to come home and it's all going to be happy and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening. 
And I called my sister whom I'm very close to -- and had three children -- and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?" 
There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder. 
(Applause) The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides. 
And what shall we do? 
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said, "but some people are stronger in the broken places." 
You know, in recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. 
I don't have much to ask of you. 
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure, and whether this is one that predisposes -- and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. 
The will is there. 
It was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership. 
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing -- I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing -- I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. 
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS -- it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said, "You tried your hardest and failed miserably. 
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can, and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. 
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed. 
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. 
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there, pushing him in, those turned up jeans. 
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school. 
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually, from the shape, that these are skull fragments. 
Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't. 
But the statistical result is loud and clear. 
Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly. 
In fact, policy is paramount. 
GDP has been our hammer. 
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces, and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. 
And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. 
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?" 
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar with it, is a natural ingredient, and it contains a special property. 
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles. 
He didn't know what death row meant. 
But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position. 
You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech, things that you can't get out of closed captioning. 
So, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital. 
They have had to move, and every parliament session, I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls, to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed, and so in my trips to the different islands, I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops, the contamination of the water lenses, and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate, within five to 10 years. 
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device. 
This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old. 
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania, which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. 
Here's an example of one such text. 
And finally, it's a rich lavender, and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black. 
(Applause) This is your conference, and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period, about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. 
And it involves a great deal of technique. 
My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates, such as the sinister question, bulging with hidden motives and innuendo, "Where are you from?" 
And of course, coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines, you get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines, but not in others. 
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on, but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person. 
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom. 
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in. 
And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction, and I needed to be back helping. 
Already, I'll give you an example. 
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent. 
So why aren't we jumping up and down about this? 
She gave me heat, she gave me cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots. 
Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important, because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years, in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. 
The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. 
I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough. 
There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch. 
In the early 2000s, Arabs were flooding the web. 
And you saw that in the '30s, when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on. 
"OK. OK? OK. OK. 
And that blew my mind. 
And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians, he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk, and started writing out the powers of two: two, four, eight, 16 -- come on, join in with me, you know how it goes -- 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048. 
Now, I know what you might be thinking. 
So the expansion slows down with time. 
It was about everything. 
My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. 
It doesn't need light. 
After I left Bimini, I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort. 
It will probably increase, and the probability is enormously huge. 
And no one raised their hand. 
And I sat down, and I opened my legs. 
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak. 
And it's important to remember that, because if we don't, then we become ahistorical. 
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived, had much higher CO2 than today, was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO2 on climate. 
So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design, furniture and other parts, but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia, only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. 
Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest. 
Some came from the winning party. 
So full circle -- why do I do this? 
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. 
If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes, and then in rooms, and then in buildings, and then in cities, do they also have a final skin, and is that skin perceptual? 
At the same time, we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems. 
Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it, and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately, about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project. 
I call it benjoin in the local vernacular, and the botanical name is Terminalia bentzoe, subspecies bentzoe. 
And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data. 
(Laughter) So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. 
Just do it outside, please." 
We're so good at this we don't really even notice it. 
["CG Destruction"] ["'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003)"] ["Massive Software - Crowd Generation"] ["Academy Award Winner for Visual Effects"] ["'Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ' (1925)"] ["Miniatures and Puppets Bring the Crowd to Life"] ["'Gladiator' (2000)"] ["CG Coliseum and Digital Crowds"] ["Academy Award Winner for Visual Effects"] ["'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' (2011)"] ["Academy Award Nominee for Visual Effects"] ["Produced in conjunction with the Academy's Science and Technology Council."] (Applause) ["'It is today possible to realize the most impossible and improbable things.' — Georges Méliès"] Don Levy: Thank you. 
And revolutions? 
What are the risk factors? 
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side. 
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. 
Because if we can make a profit, we can do it for 10, 100, a million, 100 million, a billion. 
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining? 
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male. 
He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. 
Today, we can take a routine job, codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions, and then replicate it a million times. 
So I think it's a great example of things unseen, which the power of mathematical language allows you to create. 
But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff, and you enslave stuff. 
Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing. 
(Music) (Applause) Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it, and I dance around a small stage so -- two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on -- what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it. 
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale. 
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this. 
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket, and I sold all these little doughnuts to people, and I came back, and I was like, "You see?" 
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges. 
This is her half-sister. 
Because, if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration, I should tell you how much it costs. 
He can place those exactly where he wants. 
HC: So the key thing to remember here is, we don't really care what this tuna really is. 
So I should talk about art. 
Rodney Mullen: That's a good question. 
Some are included, some are excluded. 
I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. 
is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams, but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction. 
Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: "Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice." 
In another year's time, three extra steps. 
I think novelists put this best. 
(Laughter) This is the final design for Times Square, and it will create a level surface, sidewalk to sidewalk, beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards, creating a great new energy on the street, and we think it's going to really create a great place, a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name. 
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. 
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people, when they get educated, lose it: they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than. 
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize. 
Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency. 
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things. 
There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes. 
Allow many people to come in. 
So we have this database of things. 
And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse; I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web, that have been extraordinarily innovative; I've gone back to the history of the first cities; I've even gone to biological environments, like coral reefs and rainforests, that involve unusual levels of biological innovation; and what I've been looking for is shared patterns, kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. 
I'm in my garage, making weird stuff. 
They are using Flip cameras to record, edit, and reporting to their own channel, Kibera TV. 
We'd like to understand that. 
Nothing could be less materialistic, or more sentimental, than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees, because he wants to please Jennifer. 
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. 
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light. 
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me -- called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter) And what we did was we put people on our egg map. 
So this means that if we manage to look death in the face, and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide, like some of the men or women I know did, such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo and other people I know, like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer, who gave up field assignments after a trauma. 
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter) Sometimes they look like our spouses, but they are not your parents or spouses. 
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that first of all, you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience. 
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office, "I will drive. I will drive. 
So what we did was, we got the victims down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them. 
And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. 
In the 18th century, it became a verb, and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. 
This is a mighty industry, and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes. 
I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate, but most importantly, highly trained, specialized mental health professionals. 
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them. 
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. 
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer, about typography, even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. 
The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted -- he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. 
Are they alive? 
In-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it." 
And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me. 
Here's what it looks like in 2002, 2006, 2008. 
(Applause) Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately? 
Avelile had the virus, she was born with the virus. 
When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both. 
And this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with. 
Even in the slums of India more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools. 
Now, when you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of: all these big, hard, elaborate corals and lots of bright, colorful fishes and things. 
So, this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. 
Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like. 
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them. 
So are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are, are somehow an E8 object of possibility? 
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. 
This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal. 
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes. 
However, in the presence of the tumor, now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Depending on the context, depending on the outcome, choose your paradigm. 
Or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming. 
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces. 
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware? 
For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. 
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago. 
It's not as though, as I try to suggest, it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things, or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things. 
Helping Africa is noble. 
It's true. 
Like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life. 
And we get within about the same price as current electricity. 
Why are they numbered? Is this person more rare than the other one?" 
So that's a problem in philosophy, but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I don't have to worry about this. 
There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively. 
Not because you force them to do something against their will, but because they wanted to connect. 
(Laughter) Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song. 
(Laughter) And I barely finished elementary school. 
We were apart then for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal for both of us. 
You may think they're obsolete now that our science and technology are so powerful. 
You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life -- but no, you just love them harder. 
I was taught that when I was very, very young. 
There's an outer layer and an inner layer. 
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person? 
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan. 
It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off. 
It's kind of arrogant. 
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy. 
And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths. 
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase, and now, as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing, it becomes even more prominent. Where are all these people going to come from? 
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. 
The person who said five of clubs say stop, when the cards are in the air, right? 
But meanwhile, as you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature, set in the context of that, interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place. 
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall. 
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in, Ni'lin, Wallajeh, in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible, valued and effective in their work. 
The energy's a little bit high here. 
But when something like this happens, things are qualitatively changing. 
But if you give talks to kids, you know, one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think, "Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go, you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever. 
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. 
You would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls. 
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract. 
But reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year. 
This is the first time it has ever been recorded. 
This is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected and that allow certain visual access at certain places. 
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono, have to get into all these technical words. 
NW: So this is from this animal right here, Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon. 
This is a key issue. 
We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years. 
And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot. 
It was perfectly natural. 
And that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles." 
The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth: growth that is consistent, quarter on quarter; growth that is competitive, better than the other person; and growth that is profitable, so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. 
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day. 
These techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated. 
Then I'd say, "How do you know?" 
Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two? 
This can all seem very sinister. 
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object. 
Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good. 
Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of your normally available resources. 
So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient. 
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like "Avatar." 
Here's how you grew. 
(Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. 
And this freaked the media businesses out -- it freaked them out every time. 
And a light bulb went off, which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers. 
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable, you've succeeded. 
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic. 
There's good news here, for example, from Latin America, where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming basically to a dead-end, with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil, leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies, which today, for example, in some countries, have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch, zero till farming which, not only produces more food, 
You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded. 
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming, which leaves the soil in place, getting healthier from year to year -- slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere. 
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it. 
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible? 
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. 
It's laying dead on its belly. 
They are wiping out traditions and practices. 
Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war" is that we have to acknowledge that Islam, as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people, was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks -- and as a consequence, at one degree of remove, the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. 
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. 
9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him. 
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life." 
And so this is very important. 
So I decided to give him a little support, and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. 
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion." 
Why is that important? 
Thank you very much. 
I don't get necessarily inspired by research. 
And what we're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us. 
(Laughter) Obvious, right. 
I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social, environmental and political in nature. 
(Laughter) But one of the great things about the search for massive primes, it's not just finding the primes. 
But that's just where it starts. 
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. 
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. 
All right. 
JC: While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, "Do you have a husband?" 
We really changed how people see the Middle East. 
You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up you're dead. Alright? 
Imagine touring this facility, learning about how the leather or meat is cultured, seeing the process from beginning to end, and even trying some. 
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, "Wait a second. 
He has complained a lot about people copying him, but in one interview I read, he said it has really forced him to up his game. 
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience, have that creative edge, if you know what I'm talking about. 
This guy's 60 years old. 
So, about three years ago I was in London, and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said, I represent a group of people, and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. 
And — I really would ask that — and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey." 
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful. 
Privacy is the building block of our democracies. 
The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle. 
People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information, real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use. 
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. 
They're called Millennium Development Goals. 
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable -- there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting, was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad. 
And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors, and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. 
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground. 
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. 
My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave, right around the corner from here at Georgetown. 
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. 
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally, and it surely doesn't work virtually. 
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art. 
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. 
Where is the danger going to exist? 
It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation. 
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller, and therefore more wild area is freed up. 
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. 
Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS. 
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. 
And what else do you think about these people? 
This region right here is the reactor. 
It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble -- and this is the idea of inflation— one large bubble surrounded by something else. 
But as many people have said, there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. 
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened, disk-like structure. 
For instance, here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall, an artist born in 1887. 
I walk around and encourage them, "Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two. 
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life. 
She thought I'd gone off my head. 
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site? 
Then you notice that if that Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough, there's an entire open-source, third-party, independent Lego CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make, in fact, movies out of Lego, 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube, and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things. 
So, how do we do that? 
They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not. 
Of course, we can't forget Africa. 
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore. 
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World." 
But it was something he later turned to his advantage. 
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened. 
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village, and they agree to that. 
(Laughter) As you can see, these are all maps. 
As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. 
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it? 
But I can give you a few examples. 
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies. 
And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast. 
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think. 
So I didn't give up. I continued. 
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there. 
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people," is about the most home-biased thing you can find. 
And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet, here's her Collusion profile. 
Now, the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires, and it took a lot of time and attention. 
So we shouldn't dismiss this because it's an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results, or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health. 
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. 
(Applause) So, this guy, with all the cells in his body, all have the same genetic information. 
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do, and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. 
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice. 
To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. 
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. 
"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one; you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one -- I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment. 
And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter, How they loved "X Factor," how they had two factors, How that did not matter, distinctiveness made them better, By the end of the night they knew they were meant together. 
ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause) I study the future of crime and terrorism, and frankly, I'm afraid. 
We've been asking it here at TED already. 
We can be at the table or we can be on the table. 
SS: But is it safe to use everyday? 
So I'm trying to penetrate that. 
This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. 
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing. 
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we'll see that right there, it says, "Welcome to the dungeon." 
Air force, strategic airlift goes both ways. 
Not just show up to class every now and then. 
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking. 
Not very long. OK. 
It's doubling every 18 months now. 
And Grandma was even more excited. 
Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. 
And this is where you come in. 
But this is just the point. 
And it had nothing to do with technical capability. 
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least, at a minimum, been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities, which presumably, from our perspective, gives them the ability to decrease their own risk, and then obviously the risk to their families, the village, the country, and the world. 
You go again and again and again. 
Or a mother who, at four o'clock, suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. 
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya. 
Thank you. 
Fast-forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors. 
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself. 
You can be logical and intuitive. 
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene. 
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated -- tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. 
And it was worth it, because they bought this thing, and it played out on such a grand scale, and it's so internationally recognizable, but for me it was actually a very, very depressing year. 
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth. 
Now, this was cosmic. 
And every time, we see the same thing. 
It's a national holiday. 
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her. 
SP: What about religious faith in general? 
So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. 
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells -- actually, the machines that are operating -- that's where the action is. 
Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark. 
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way. 
The success will not come if we "just," quote, unquote, fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane. 
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower. 
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period. 
We don't go home at the end of the day and think, "Well, I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points." 
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. 
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama. 
Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that you're a performance artist. 
Man, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade. 
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine, and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. 
This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
We need to identify how we can start to leverage these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems. 
So now I need to name this object. 
So this is some work that we're doing. 
Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. 
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see, and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me. 
Okay. There's 15 feet. 
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition. 
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak? 
We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient, not even the NSA. 
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works. 
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog." 
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so -- (Laughter) -- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. 
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes." 
We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain, but if it will be a different organ, it will be a different transducer attached to the patient. 
We really struggle to do this. 
The only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. 
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
They don't get any information, they don't get any value for what they spend. 
Can that be right? 
So, what do I discover when I look at artworks? 
So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here. 
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. 
How do we take their contributions to their jobs, their communities and their families, and convert that value into reputation capital? 
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't. 
That's what keeps you from getting help. 
That's the only way they are effective. 
Just as you move, it generates power. 
The real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue. 
If you could pick up the white area, it would look like the figure on the bottom. 
Is it because their weapons weren't accurate? 
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die, they grow larger and they reproduce a lot. 
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves? 
We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS. 
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades. 
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online, inspire each other to greatness. 
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show. 
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations. 
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving ... 
We felt like we were surrogate parents. 
Texting has developed one from this slash. 
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in. 
So at the end of it, we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own, irrespective of who or where they were. 
So Wilson's Principle Number Three: March away from the sound of the guns. 
So when my mother used to take me to school, she thought I was at school, and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned, and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. 
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. 
Well, making and testing models of the universe is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe. 
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap. 
"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge. 
This is challenging work to do. 
No, I mean, I think -- CA: But is that your hair? 
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story. 
And when people have done a variety of studies, they have learned things such as, when a baby is born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother. 
Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. 
Just look at pandemics -- swine flu, bird flu, H1N1. 
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers, the carpenters -- some would say the butchers -- of the medical world: cutting, reshaping, reforming, bypassing, fixing. 
Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home. 
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. 
The second school I was at had big trees too, had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country, and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields. 
A hundred years ago, guess what? 
And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you, I mean, surely there are huge risks with that. 
We got data from the Gallup Organization, which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately. 
We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it. 
I should have gotten it so they could have won. 
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. 
He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be, if he were whole. 
So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography. 
In fact, the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. 
Now these collars are put onto animals. 
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. 
All these things are possible -- some of them are very close, or already, as you heard, are available today, in some way or form. 
And yeah, we're there. 
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws. 
We are playing with fire. 
The problem, as we see it, has to do with a single, simple word: "space," or a single, simple phrase: "real world geometry." 
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. 
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall, because L'Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed, so musicians were moving out. 
So we get this. (Text: bad christians) But it's even worse, because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God. 
It actually changes the way people think. 
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. 
I see evidence everywhere of how it works. 
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. 
It's a definition really of Euclidean space. 
Lee Cronin: So many people think that life took millions of years to kick in. 
Working together is what changes our world. 
It developed in collectives of human beings. 
But in the quantum world, this happens all the time. 
If we come back to the same place in 2001, what we're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads, and more roads after that, at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows. 
Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances: alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia, black, had to take care of a younger brother. 
The question we all face now is, "How can we make best use of this media? 
So in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures, these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play. 
And about three years later, when I left the hospital, I started studying at the university. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way, then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix, in a particular moral matrix. 
The new machine age can be dated to a day 15 years ago when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, played Deep Blue, a supercomputer. 
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you, in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib, or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there? 
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. 
And I understand that. Who can blame them? 
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K., but it's a global phenomenon. 
It turns out that driving, with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles, is actually a harder problem to solve than flying. 
RB: Of course. 
And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation, like this one, which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before, until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved. 
And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined, even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands, just hiding them in the pockets. 
A few years later, we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want, the way you want it and the easy way? 
(Laughter) I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark, New Jersey. 
I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. 
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. 
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia. 
So let's start off by defining some terms. 
But actually, there's a lot of people who, if they're given the chance, would love to invest in something that does social good. 
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago. 
And a lot of people, especially in the art community, don't necessarily engage in science in this way. 
It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. 
In Fort Chippewa, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain, this has been scientifically proven. 
So that's a still from the video there. 
Why no hearings, no denunciations, no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House? What's the deal? 
But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment? 
Look where my belief had brought me to. 
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was. 
This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective. 
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. 
Why are you still thinking that the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?" 
Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed. 
AG: Okay, hypothesis two. 
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website, and someone said, "When I look at the first photo, I ask myself, what was he thinking? 
It's going to change the way we have children. 
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this. 
This is the most complex. 
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated. 
Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. 
We've learned an amazing amount. 
Other studies have shown this as well. 
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly. 
And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone. 
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone. 
It was cute. 
I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. 
We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. 
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition. 
Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process, and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. 
The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed? 
But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units. 
This is very promising. 
And they started listening to the marketplace, and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips, and sorghum bread, and before you knew it, we had cornered the Kigali market, and the women were earning three to four times the national average. 
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. 
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads. 
It was actually robotic surgery. 
The tree can easily recover. 
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on. 
Without needles and radioactivity, without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
First of all -- any questions so far? 
No, I'm not even going to look up. No." 
It triples the amount of oily, messy goo that you have in the water, and it makes it very hard to handle. 
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996, I was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then, bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting. 
And ultimately, up in the flytower, the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur. 
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.

I found myself in a cell, handcuffed, blindfolded. 
I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges. 
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. 
So that became a challenge. 
But I was curious to know, what else would they do if they could do this much? 
We see that the world is feeling "used" at 3.3 times the normal level right now. 
and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. 
Anyone can kill me, or you, or you. 
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy. 
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. 
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific. 
And we find that when we do that, we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results. 
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. 
There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. 
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. 
The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. 
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame, and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they're doing. 
(Whistling) This is very promising. 
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections, one we called the general election, the second we should call the money election. 
Supercomputers -- same thing. 
We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars. 
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. 
And with the money he earned he could stay this year. 
This plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls. 
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple. 
But once the annual rains began, the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park. 
It's a really important problem. 
Time. How can you look at time? 
It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. 
It's particularly a cultural crisis, a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing, unable to challenge the oil-hungry, selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption, from southern California to New York to Dubai. 
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage, some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid, the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. 
Well I think you probably already have the picture. 
We don't tell them to do anything. 
(Music) In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. 
I mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it, you know, productive down the road. 
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it; I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools. 
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women. 
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there. 
But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. 
So this was really interesting to me, this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life, and also adding interactivity to sculpture. 
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. 
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time. 
These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended, but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses. 
So then once you do that you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?" 
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground. 
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco." 
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

IM: Oh, it's so fabulous! 
And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic, and that's based on the light. 
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here. 
I can't believe that I did it." 
I was alone on foot. 
(Applause) Everyone needs a coach. 
In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven, and so I was not functioning as a composer.

In her essay, "The White Album," Joan Didion writes, "We tell ourselves stories in order to live. 
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank, I learned about the Torre David, a 45-story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. 
And credit where it's due -- on many levels, vaccines are a successful technology. 
And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen. 
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience. 
(Laughter) This looks like — (Applause) This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon. 
Who should you invite to lunch? 
So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale. 
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers, but we don't have very good software for them. 
I think that the claim, the aim and the task are all misconceived. 
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant. 
You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important? 
They're searching for bush meat; forest animals they can kill to feed their families. 
So some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves. 
But alas, that hole has closed up. 
One is that they're highly prevalent. 
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great. 
And he is a world expert in performing "The Ursonate," which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem by Kurt Schwitters, written in the 1920s, which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense. 
Our bodies have adapted to these new diets. 
In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition -- there was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees. 
Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news. 
Finally, I'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication. 
Some trained musicians out there. 
(Applause) But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common. 
and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people. 
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. 
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned. 
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation. 
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake, and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping. 
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years, has quite successfully filtered the web, is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services, because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. 
Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction, so if you were to take the lid off that bottle, it won't stay inside. 
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason. 
I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song. 
We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. 
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It’s no joke: it’s real. 
And all the tiles match up again. 
In fact, we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had. 
Instead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s, things had gotten worse. 
So he designed a plotter as well, and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. 
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. 
Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. 
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years. 
When I ask people "What's wrong with having a conversation?" 
And these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal, and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you’ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. 
And we've asked: What is the scientific unifying idea here? 
It wastes the body, but the mind remains intact. 
That's not too good. 
A random odd number is a lot harder to test. 
Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings: they can sense this new quality in yourself, and it helps them already, and gives them an example. 
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. 
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers. 
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. 
This is an aspirational graph. 
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot. 
And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith. 
One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera. 
They came, and there were nine of them -- nine Taliban. 
It's a different idea, because usually, when people talk about early childhood programs, they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants, in preschool, they have better K-12 test scores, better adult earnings. 
These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means. 
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. 
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one. 
But first, I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system, for the oceans and for the Earth. 
It’s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition. 
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one. 
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward. 
Now, this is starting to happen in transistors. 
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. 
If you do lose a lot of weight, you become hungry, and your muscles burn less energy. 
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place, it was just fantastic. 
Totally mortifying to him. 
Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. 
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. 
Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi. 
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed. 
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work. 
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences. 
That was post-War Europe. 
But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented, as we started to automate the economy, and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses, as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy, the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot. 
We didn't know about DoubleArrow. 
So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. 
You need also state ownership, especially of land assets, in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. 
Do you know what that says to me? 
And so he's assembled a group of people. 
And also, is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology, and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. 
Other birds, like this tanager, have adapted within the same species. 
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. 
You know, we're bound together, not, I think by technology, entertainment and design, but by common cause. 
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. 
I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view. 
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user, who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq." 
So, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. 
Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends, and that creates a huge challenge. 
His name is Madhav Chavan, and he created something called Pratham. 
And he was so inspired by this article, it kind of directed the rest of his life. 
In fact, inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits, right? 
Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya, 50 percent of those from a single town in Libya, hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi, a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group. 
Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. 
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. 
And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place. 
It's not whose army wins; it's also whose story wins. 
How could this be? 
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them, the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. 
Most of them have fairly good education. 
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters. 
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example. 
So, can we print money for international aid? 
Do not fear what has blown up. 
This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy, because you are here. 
But my skin color wasn't right. 
And now we have 70 percent -- since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world. 
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say, That's really cool, but what's it good for? 
You may have heard, this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an 18-month study by two Nobel economists, focusing on happiness and wellness in France. 
I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before. 
C: This is the gun. 
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds? 
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening, which is as important as external globalization. 
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time, whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. 
Why? Because if you earn a lot of money, you can give away a lot of money, and if you're successful in that career, you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers in developing countries, and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done. 
Energy systems of the world becoming progressively -- year on year, decade on decade, century on century -- becoming less carbon intense. 
This is a Christmas tree of a fish; everything on this fish lights up, it's not just that lure. 
Why? Because for free, this isn't a new technology, this is a letter -- we're getting a Big Bang in behavior. 
Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. 
But then in the last two years, it goes up again to 39 percent, indicating a rising living cost. 
This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I’ll be more than happy to show that I can say: “What’s good” “Whatagwan” And of course …“Hello” Because I’m “articulate” Thank you. 
We saw geysers coming out. 
And here's another example. 
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. 
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play." 
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is "mise en place," which is just a French way of saying, "get organized." 
So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee for above-knee amputees. 
Part of the income for his farm. 
It's quite free of commercial clutter: you don't see our logos and brands and names, and therefore you're alert to things physically. 
These three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of Western societies, with radical consequences for the individual. 
It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan. 
But what it means to have a brain there is that, not only the big brain has to talk with the food, the food has to talk with the brain, because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. 
There's another pile of leaves. 
And there are lots of other examples. 
This one is a circle, and this is a square. 
(Music) (Clunk) (Clunk) (Clunk) (Clunk) So what this bird does is fight his own image. 
So, the social layer is all about these connections. 
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding -- here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter -- for China to adopt cradle to cradle. 
(Laughter) So, should Vander play football? 
I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. 
He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge. 
So what's caused this excitement? 
We can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter) So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) — and his parting comment as we shook hands was, "Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this, we'll gladly take it." (Laughter) So my lesson that year was persistence. 
But through it all, look for a way to break out, to find a field and subject not yet popular. 
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog." 
In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments. 
You should always use a condom," and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered -- what's going to happen? 
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down. 
I mean, if they have the same mutation, and they get this genetic test, and they understand it, then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life. 
Now, that's a bit boring. 
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop. 
Now this is the neurological goldmine, if you like, because a known reward excites people, but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward, the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty, that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not. 
Interestingly enough, you give them a few months, and this is what happens. 
But when we live in a denser community, suddenly what we find, of course, is that the things we need are close by. 
That means the next time you are in the grocery store, take a look at the four people ahead of you in line. 
Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? 
So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. 
Go in there and look at the archives, and you will begin to understand much more of what I've been talking about today. 
Okay. (Laughter) Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent, you have people guessing three, four times that level. 
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she? 
The man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America. 
There isn't anything wrong with nuke. 
The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries. 
Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity. 
It matters to me because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble -- trouble certainly in how we relate to each other, but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection. 
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty. 
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently, because there are tens of thousands of these, and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. 
We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing. 
But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world? 
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly 200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization, problems of forest management, problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist: climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example, as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing -- that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture. 
"Police chief fires Taser into 14 year-old girl's head." 
So, the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet. 
You took a pathogen, you modified it, you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened. 
(Laughter) Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. 
They're going to have to care in the social program, but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years, then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. 
It's a beard trimmer, you see? 
Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest -- because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050. 
And if you move to the right you also get language, because that's abstracting even further from resemblance, but still maintaining meaning. 
And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. 
Now, planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story. 
And we know selection works. 
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay. 
But it's happening all over the place, and these tools are part of what's making it possible. 
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries, and those are the 12 stars on the European flag. 
And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins -- when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. 
I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. 
It's short. And on the bottom, this is the repeat sequence for the egg case, or tubuliform silk protein, for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. 
(Laughter) And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox, I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection. 
On the [right] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses. 
The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. 
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days, I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. 
Thank you very much for your time. 
Why should we care? 
He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister, basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street, and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying, "I bid you good day, sir." (Laughter) The thing he designed was this monstrosity here, the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this, this is a view from above. 
So what happened here? 
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters. 
Because we never talk to the people in these countries. 
You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed, maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years. 
Let's see. 
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there. 
There's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them. 
There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. 
So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. 
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. 
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. 
And it's an important issue because it means that we have to, as a society, think about what we value. 
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test. 
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure. 
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs -- getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses. 
So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them, and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive, I knew we had to give it a go. 
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans, but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. 
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize, describe, the way that scientists find out about the world. 
They're going to be the tough ones. 
And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world, the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on. 
Finally, he accepted my offer, and once I started a class in his compound, the word spread all over. 
We haven't finished analyzing this data, so we're still peeking in, but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not, which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that. 
And we found three. 
I don't know the answers. 
I've been quite interested in both. 
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies. 
And on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday, there will be global Live Earth concerts. 
It's basically efficient brainstorming, and when I visited David to learn about his research, he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method: PowerPoint. 
So let me summarize where we are. 
And they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up; they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators, and in so doing, they accumulate. 
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. 
And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin. 
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning. 
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable, and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men who got yellow fever ran. Right? 
This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. 
I sure am glad I never saw her again. 
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress. 
So exactly why did China grow so much faster? 
(Laughter) TR: So, we've talked a lot about global warming, but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice -- good weather in the wintertime, and New York City. 
Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients. 
I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling. 
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. 
One was his daughter, Laurence. 
So -- oh, jack of spades. 
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. 
However, it's all about balance here. 
One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder. 
I just tell the stories. 
And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. 
We work in groups, in big cities — (Laughter) — and in small villages. 
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser, not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. 
Every employee, from secretary to CEO, was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. 
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. 
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure. 
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. 
All of our statuses are different. 
She does this with cardboard, but since I have an expensive computer here I'll just rotate this little guy around and ... 
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was. 
So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy. 
Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention. 
And as you go up, those are the bigger trials, so they've got less error in them. 
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all. 
So what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget. 
And indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest, from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, from Canada down to the Gulf. 
You can see here the picture of somebody's brain with Alzheimer's disease next to a healthy brain, and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain, ringed red, there's obvious damage -- atrophy, scarring. 
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. 
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. 
And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health. 
["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"] You have to hit many different platforms. 
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular. 
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity. 
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson. 
We call it Cool Carpet. 
Example: Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. 
She went back to her life and, fortunately, today she is doing well. 
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect, learn, remember and want to improve. 
Not bad. It's also not good. 
And if I vote it makes a difference. 
Ladies, don't do it. 
So each idea has its own meme-ome, and each idea is unique with that, but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other, they kind of steal sometimes, and they certainly build on each other, and we can go through mathematically and take the meme-ome from one talk and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk, and if there's a similarity between the two of them, we can create a link and represent that as a graph, just like Eric and I are connected. 
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. 
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying. 
Hands up -- how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? 
Ready for some jokes? 
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing. 
And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect. 
And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. 
And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings. 
Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you don't care where -- whether it's aid. 
So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. 
Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, "Well I guess that was just a place for girls. 
And I said, "Yeah. 
Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. 
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. 
They're out there because they need to eat. 
The city goes out in annular rings, consuming more and more green space, and more and more roads, and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead. 
But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war. 
Thank you. 
It's difficult to swim in. 
Wow, that's interesting. 
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course, which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained. 
These are not just crop plants, as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway -- fantastic work there. 
I was 22, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the United States. 
After all, we humans are animals, too, and it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species-spanning approach to health. 
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. 
This reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent, which saved them money, and at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales. 
Now, so many of these students had come from households where English isn't spoken in the home, where a lot of them have different special needs, learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded. 
So he starts out with one line, and then two, and then four, and then 16, and so on. 
We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer and who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery. 
SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements, we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over. 
It prevents weird things from the north. 
The next thing, the telephones go out, the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street, there's roadblocks. 
I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. 
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations, but are too scared to mention them. 
Size and scale are no longer the same. 
So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. 
At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. 
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book? 
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months renovating this place. 
I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty, so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. 
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. 
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors. 
That could power a rocket there. 
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ... 
So this is the Gulf of Mexico, sparkling place full of fish. 
The mystery is this: What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences, such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet? 
It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me. 
This could really change the way we do clinical trials. 
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use? 
It just became big, heavy deforestation and an environmental problem. 
We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. 
Sex tips are not glamorous. 
But if you look, even today there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths in India alone. 
But for me, unlike them, in my world, the slate was not clean, and what was written on it was not encouraging. 
But then one author arrived, and he changed the game forever. 
We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations. 
(Laughter) So the video won't show everything. 
Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying off one of your children? 
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out. 
I look around and I see them everywhere. 
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide. 
I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind, the things that made us different from everybody else, and all our relatives. 
I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. 
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. 
SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play. 
When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day, or the old songs. 
What turns me on about the digital age, what excites me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. 
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated. 
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves, "Are we next?" 
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could. 
The electricity is free. 
The final movement is called Mounds. 
And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface that's maybe really creative and interesting? 
(Applause) Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide? 
It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. 
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye, you don't really see how complex it is, but when you use a microscope, finally the hidden complexity is revealed. 
And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas. 
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer, a world-class language learner, and a tango champion. 
That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing, a better life for people. 
So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus. 
Maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today, is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture, millions of them, every season, in the paddy season, when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water. 
We have no control over these forces. 
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims -- who care very, very deeply about their traditions, who do not want to compromise those values -- believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam, that these two ideas can work together. 
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled. 
The people knew their God by His mighty acts. 
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden. 
Those shapes are parabolas. 
I've been working with him about 10 years. 
Well there's an answer that many people would give. 
We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species, but plastic hurts people too, especially poor people. 
Would you like a better system? 
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? 
Not as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely. 
So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. 
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. 
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. 
Given that it was such a vast civilization, you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings, and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings. 
Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene. 
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. 
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water. 
The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe, and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. 
And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders, and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith, and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists across the world. 
(Music) (Laughter) NM: Uh, sure. 
And as we say at Worldchanging, another world isn't just possible; another world is here. 
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material. Again, a stop-up. 
♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ Thanks. 
Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff and the villages of about 1,500 people. 
Lots of risk factors, but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. 
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly. 
(Laughter) So they get to try again, and this time they got it right. 
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries. 
No, I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here, which shows me the slides ahead, the slides behind, my notes from here, so I can see what's going on. 
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller, mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more, and living in detached buildings, you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. 
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?) JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?) JA: Well, because these sort of things reveal what the true state of, say, Arab governments are like, the true human-rights abuses in those governments. 
So let's try them. 
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it. 
Sub-surface water on Mars, frozen in the form of ice. 
So genomics, proteomics, the environment, all this data streaming at us individually and us, as poor physicians, how do we manage it? 
They make a lot of money. 
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar, and they say the most important factors are: "Increased age at first marriage, increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force." 
Gigantic mistake: I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra, go right to geometry and trig. 
And the big picture is this: elections should be verifiable. 
One of them also being, although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it, if it only serves two floors, it's actually bloody terrifying, okay? 
better than lamb produced in New Zealand, frozen and shipped to the U.K.? 
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife. 
And the back story is this: SOPA and PIPA, as legislation, were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century. 
Why is this? 
I thought this would be easy, but I emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where I lived, and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. 
That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere. 
He was tortured, brutally tortured to death. 
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff, which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. 
Famous for its diversity, human diversity. 
Amazing. 
And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland, and they're still working on it, because there's still a lot more to do. 
What happens? It rings. 
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet, human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable. 
(Laughter) But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online. 
Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. 
I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court. 
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now, those first deliveries to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year. 
My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. 
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. 
And my grandfather would call me every week, and he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?" 
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes, and that is a good thing, because your conscious mind -- how do we put this politely? -- it's easily distracted. 
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained. 
And we have not thought enough about the solutions. 
We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. 
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently, and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin, and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive and differentiated, depending on where it is. 
Let's go back to diabetes. 
So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space. 
It's what comes after thought but before language. 
He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot. 
I had no idea. 
Now what you need to do, if you're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or Alzheimer's disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe. 
And that is that we live in a competent universe, that we are part of a brilliant planet, and that we are surrounded by genius. 
Some of them were hypothermic, some of them were frostbitten, some were both. 
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. 
(Laughter) The weather station's pretty interesting. 
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby, there's no problem with this visual. 
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future." 
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. 
So what we do is we give you another word, one for which the system does know the answer. 
And I decided that I was going to set out to try to solve this problem. 
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation. 
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. 
But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing. 
And of course, look at Africa. 
So we're able to then see the self-assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we've seen previously, and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse, very complex, organic black tar. 
You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box of who-knows-what. Do they have a point? 
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor, but hasn't actually had that cancer, to call themselves. 
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. 
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore. 
It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately, one of these met an unfortunate end. 
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. 
Side street in Italy. 
But he gave me a cup of tea. 
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. 
They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in. 
So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules, and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. 
They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive? 
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something, and it feels like it's made of stone. 
Jung may have called it "the subconscious." 
And we're encouraging others to do it as well. 
Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it. 
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke, afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage, and felt that they were bound to lose. 
A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes, doesn't know how to do those things, and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind. 
And she told me -- the nurses hadn't mentioned this -- that she was blind, that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years. 
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics. 
So, when Ragav experienced that he went from "teacher told me," to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift. 
And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described, the power shift represented by transition among states, the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states, we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. 
I must say, many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like, but let's talk about it. 
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets, while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography. 
You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. 
And the last day, the sun comes out, the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. 
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here. 
We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are, and yet, through our insouciance, we keep on destroying them. 
The males have dominance displays that they use when they're chasing each other's females. 
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. 
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. 
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight. 
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all. 
NP: Where it came from. 
You can see it for yourself. There are colors, streetlights, new pavement with no potholes, trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe." 
(Applause) Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful example of the technology. 
We were a little bit rattled. 
It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers, covering what is now Pakistan, Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran. 
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because, I mean, it's very, very trivial. 
And they look at Europe, and they see an example, again, to follow. 
So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. 
Every year, thousands of cochlear implants, diabetic pumps, pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. 
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years. 
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then -- but it's still the same theme song -- and introduce you to my lab and current work, which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. 
We need to make the best mathematical models we can, the most consistent ones. 
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. 
Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. 
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born. 
Probably not. 
You know, what if people are rational? 
That's 200 watt-hours. 
You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said. 
It could really change things quite significantly. 
Did it answer the question? 
So we're going to watch another film. 
Now this, for me, is a common situation. 
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub, one on the left by Robert Colescott. 
Now, there's another problem. 
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories. 
It needs months and years. 
I had very good friends there, who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai. 
The meme went out there. 
Well, so far only one connectome is known, that of this tiny worm. 
He sort of does that. But I'm going to -- Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh. 
Number one: high expectations. 
So there's 2005, -6, -7, -8. 
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing." 
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy. 
And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS, email and web, and put a map so that you could see what was happening where, and you could visualize that data. 
And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. 
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square. 
It was still 1991. 
And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing, which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision. 
And this is our building, which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company. 
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. 
this is easy, $1.10. 
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. 
I'd lost so much weight in the hospital I now weighed about 80 pounds. 
(Laughter) There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture. 
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. 
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. 
You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe. 
We need everyone at the table. 
Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist. 
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy. 
I don't know. 
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm, they put a chip in your head, and you're like, "I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. 
All of this information is relatively available. 
And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat? 
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing, doing new things, in the south. 
They believe juniper smoke is holy. 
More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan. 
It's not the basis of the rule of law, it's not the basis of a free society. 
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine. 
That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example. 
I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you. 
It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car. 
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature. 
This is our maiden voyage in this. 
But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist. 
It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease, let's say motor neuron disease, you take a skin sample, you do the pluripotent reprogramming, as I've already told you, and you generate live motor nerve cells. 
We know about the end of oil. 
Using this technology, this is mapping in three dimensions. 
This is another robot, Cog. 
Now that's one thing, of course. 
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it? 
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips singing "Midnight Train to Georgia," while -- (Laughter) -- in my dad's big easy chair, you know? 
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there, we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets. 
But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me. 
You went to war, came back; you're fine." 
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those. 
Public services working well. 
I think we should say it all together. 
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos, but anyway, they’re there in the garden. 
One of the senior doctors at my hospital, Charlie Safran, and his colleague, Warner Slack, have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient. 
But it was intended to be quite quiet. 
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far. 
And I asked the question, what are you doing about it? 
I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused. 
We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. 
And I realized that I had hit upon something that I think has this huge potential to change the world. 
And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities -- that better memory. 
What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki. 
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion. 
And similar topography. 
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said, "In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place, you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity. 
Remember when images were first possible with a computer, those gorgeous, full-color images? 
And you may wonder, how do we know what these sounds are? 
So even in the event of an accident, yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know, sorry for the power company, but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land. 
He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man. 
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims; they nurture victims? 
This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine. 
For example, we presented this word. 
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. 
SJ: Excellent, thank you. 
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective. 
So when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame, because it's a very, very good idea. 
It's getting blunter and blunter. 
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me. 
But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law. 
These are the dead in Jonestown. 
Now, modern slavery: according to State Department rough statistics, there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions. 
President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security, and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it. 
How could you keep the law? 
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor. 
And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right? 
He said, "I just can't rent to you." 
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. 
We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. 
I'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and, thereafter, as a reader. 
Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher. 
So the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour. 
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult, because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post-conflict situation. 
So we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona, who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech. 
A big stick, a baton stick. 
If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here, you will get another one. So you will have two." 
May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. 
We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. 
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) -- take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating. 
They're not going to die of hypothermia. 
Thanks so much for that. DH: Thank you. (Applause) I'd like to begin with a thought experiment. 
We can have 3D printers today that build structures like these. 
(Laughter) We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. 
But I want more. 
Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. 
This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea, the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. 
But we're really, really happy about who they are. 
E: I love you. 
And the more they succeed and the more power they have, the more unhappy they are. 
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system, Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s, said that, "A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income." 
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does, and then, say, it rains, and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water. 
He likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry," quoting Hulk from the movie, but I've never seen him angry. 
(Laughter) Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail, remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it. 
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy, but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane. 
You don't even recognize yourself. 
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight. 
And these are children who are flunking out of public school. 
Now, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others who work intimately with music and language, but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid, how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us. 
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. 
Who is that going to come from? 
And they are doing density, new density, better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. 
I immediately went to the personnel office, and talking with the guys in personnel, they said, "Hey, no problem finding an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho. 
Is it really yours?" 
Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly, like this one, the recent Icelandic volcano. 
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp. 
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? 
There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made, so we could build and repair them, or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy. 
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797. 
We need not just campaigning physicists, but we need biologists, computer experts and environmentalists as well. 
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. 
The truth is, everything we know about America, everything Americans come to know about being American, isn't from the news. 
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine. 
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent. 
And because of this, they have a lot of difficulty with language. 
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other, is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age. 
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim, and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night, and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done, the trainer says, "That's great. 
Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically. 
It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like, and put in the material properties. 
But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down, to condense them to their absolute essence, and from that essence create a new language, a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. 
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile. 
And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me. 
And for those we still need stem cells. 
It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it. 
Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. 
And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. 
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. 
The state is everywhere in China. 
What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals, including new viruses in the same group as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses. 
We bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant. 
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with, and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with, and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar, they're hardwired to flee and hide. 
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system. 
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA. 
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions, our interactions, and the clustering and grouping of individuals. 
He wrote that, "It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals." 
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole, even though you think it's black, it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. 
But when politics is only management of mistrust, then -- I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned -- now we're going to have "1984" in reverse. 
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. 
We went to some topless beaches. 
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball. 
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. 
And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head. 
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials. 
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. 
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. 
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months' wages for an iPhone. 
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into. 
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. 
Now, that's the good news. 
In fact, there's an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us. 
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17. 
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million. 
And it's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty. 
And I don't mean chewing the crabs. 
For instance, when I started, there were wars in the Balkans. 
(Applause) For the past decade, I've been studying non-state armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias. 
But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex. 
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust. 
And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother. 
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio; it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot. 
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth. 
It has to be, and now more than ever, with economic divisions growing wider every day. 
Let's call this scheme "Print Aid." 
So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs, that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease, that contributes to various forms of psychosis, is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you're interacting with somebody else. 
They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get. 
We're working with local communities. 
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined, he felt something different. 
Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. 
I don't want to imagine what might happen to you. 
Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left. (Laughter) Now folks, this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true. 
And we're doing it again. 
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought, "He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people." 
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status, and that's dominance. 
The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well-designed chair, where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this, and where there is something as conspicuous consumption, where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. 
And I think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity. 
Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, and we study theoretical neuroscience, and we study how the neocortex works. 
This might look familiar. 
IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever. 
You're safe. It's fine. 
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod," presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new. 
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do: that of rebuilding a life. 
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files," who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do, and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains. 
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around 2,000 years old. 
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. 
But the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately we'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around. 
I'm not reading. I never read an address. 
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan," which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter." 
SS: Why don't you show them your legs? 
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free DNA at a small level. 
(Laughter) So, my closing thought. 
This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me, I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean. 
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. 
But the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. 
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa. 
And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around -- "Get the hell away from this kid!" -- when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us. 
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome. 
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. 
I didn't know how to talk about wine. 
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is, shouldn't they own their reputation data? 
In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region, there were 500 million people living in poverty -- that number now is under 200 million. 
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not, or they get simply shelved, out of sight and out of mind. 
Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot? 
Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him, but underneath it was a constant, a guideline, a road map. 
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth, a typical growth cycle for us, and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse. 
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend -- I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today -- but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots. 
(Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. 
They want to take them out of the domain name system. 
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom. 
And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems. 
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel. 
And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help. 
And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research, which was Mexico, didn't adopt this technology, ignored this technology, talked about why this technology should be thought about, but not really applied. 
FG: Can I say something? 
But you get up at 4 a.m. 
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right. 
(Laughter) It's unpredictable -- (Music) (Laughter) like this odd country road. 
And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. 
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger, who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share, as he said, a bit of historical context. 
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education. 
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer. 
That's our number. 10 billion. 
We don't know where the structure is. 
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. 
Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic? 
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily. 
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. 
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh. 
I'm going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments. 
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics, won't touch it with a barge pole. 
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with. 
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry, which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about. 
We consult to the media about canopy questions; we have a canopy newsletter; we have an email LISTSERV. 
Remember, in the film, to me, both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body, one the mortal self and one the spirit self. 
We can play cricket together, we can be friends. 
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer. 
As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste because I raised all the money. 
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do. 
How we build things can change as well. 
I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended. 
Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally. 
You've gotta sell something. 
(Laughter) Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all. 
This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer, and yet they don't collide with one another. 
And to my horror, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to court. 
In the boreal, they are also the home where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in North America migrate north to breed and raise their young. 
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. 
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions. 
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff. 
Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else, and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost, and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything. 
(Music) You have to hack your target. 
There's only one person I know here, and that's me. 
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly, in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact of video games on the brain. 
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. 
And this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram. 
He made restitution and found himself a new job. 
These are some signs that we have all over the place: "Practical Joking with Pirates." 
That is gone. 
This is a clay maker. 
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom. 
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. 
Glamour doesn't have to be people. 
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower. 
Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel. 
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story? 
Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. 
(Applause) At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become, and then when we become those people, we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. 
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it, moving or still, and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint. 
And here's how it might work. 
Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. 
Over the last decade, seven million foreigners gained American citizenship. 
And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos. 
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object. 
CC: Okay, now you feel that? 
I would like you to hear their voices. 
It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter) Adults find it comforting. 
It's not that complicated. 
Child: Whoa! Look at that snake! 
So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution. 
That's why they're attracted to the military. 
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very submissive. 
We thought our family would already be there. 
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not, because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions. 
(Laughter) And with The 99, that is what we aim to do. 
So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. 
(Laughter) And that's an icosahedron, which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes. 
That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage. 
If we're above that line it's considered protective; if we're below that line it's not. 
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. 
Eames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States. 
So we are still that magnificent country, but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world, and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind. 
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable. 
Now, what we can do with the spectra? 
These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. 
This is pretty incredible stuff. 
Why? 
It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go. 
This is Carnegie Hall. 
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. 
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash. 
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English because I am from Queens, New York. 
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics, and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do. 
On the other side of the brain, the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news. 
On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. 
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. 
What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope. 
These mountains are dangerous places, but ultimately the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon. 
I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well. 
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. 
"It is," she said, "to help create the social world and find a credible place in it." 
Over time, they will contribute to African development and to science in ways we can only imagine. 
(Laughter) And then she looked at me. 
And that leads to specialization. 
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. 
(Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. 
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. 
Oh sorry, I dropped one. 
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation. 
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. 
We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60, they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain, no history of psychiatric disease, no drugs on board -- we do a toxicology workup. 
But it's also a great example of government as a platform. 
I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. 
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity, or heat to electricity. 
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. 
It seems to shrink, but it often comes back. 
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources, all the capacity, all the systems of the Earth, which is now having economic damage. 
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia, Canada being towed in, where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death, which was indeed a ship strike. 
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people. 
So what about making energy? 
And this is the arts program I started in 1968. 
The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone. 
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand. 
It went fast. We were arrested, signed a pledge not to drive again, released. 
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication. 
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said, "All I want to do is align belief." 
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. 
He removes it, the problems are solved, everybody in the palazzo is happy. 
So I went out there, and I auditioned, mainly in rural township locations, right around the country. 
And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. 
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?" 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup. 
And these projects will continue past these sessions, using collaborative interactive communication. 
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions. 
That's not possible. 
It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century. 
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. 
What I would like to offer here is a challenge. 
Most firemen in this country do it for free. 
Because we are all patients, we are all people. 
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding, but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet, to show their commitment to true love. 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. 
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much. 
And they actually come out kind of nice looking. 
The British government, for example, has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects. 
And when the resources came, be it oil, we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. 
It's not always appropriate every time. 
That's amazing. 
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told, and he certainly wasn't the last. 
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists. 
This insight that entropy increases, by the way, is what's behind what we call the arrow of time, the difference between the past and the future. 
"Mom, I want to make maps." 
But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa. 
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background, after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his hook and he had his -- he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that, quote -- his quote -- it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years. 
We certainly didn't have the money to do this. 
But it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it. 
A local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor, there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again." 
But maybe that's a little too obvious. 
He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels, and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis.

And I want to know the market -- the size of the market. 
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. 
So this is from a virtual autopsy. 
I got him. The wave broke over us. 
Obviously, I don't want people to do this, because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. 
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better. 
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease, which is related to a decrease in dopamine. 
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact we'd get better policy. 
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. 
And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible.

I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong. 
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry, the middle part, goes to work on it, and what it does is it performs operations on it, it extracts information from it, and it converts that information into a code. 
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else. 
And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.

So she went out and looked at what data she could find. 
Beyond that, what I found most fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that I saw across all different countries, and particularly centered around the heart of power, around public officials who were embezzling the public's money for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that because of official secrecy. 
(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.

BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. 
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem, because you have to build a small, portable robot that's not only really affordable, but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. 
What's in that information? 
And these beautiful umbrellas. 
Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City. 
The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving. 
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. 
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for? 
Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?

So what does this tell us? 
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there. 
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too. 
I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands. 
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. 
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich. 
And what happens as a result of this is, when those parties are elected, and inevitably they fail, or inevitably they make political mistakes, democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes. 
There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic, and so the firefighters themselves are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back. 
The book is called "Blessed Unrest." 
And maybe at this point, when you know what I do, or maybe what I've failed to do, you'll think that I probably ought to be fired, and I could certainly understand that. 
We are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning. 
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy. 
It's harmful because it produces a toxin, and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract. 
How does nature repel bacteria? 
But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011, he told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history. 
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere adored them. A new American classic was born." 
And again, something amazing happened, something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign. 
And many of my friends were ballet dancers. 
Remember him -- old philosopher? 
Yeah. 
But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. 
And above all, to me, food is about respect. 
We've lots of blood vessels in there. 
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?" 
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. 
It's that big. 
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one.

More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see these communities start, hesitatingly, to come together. 
And look, this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips. 
What's the smallest number we can get away with? 
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface, and we actually saw the Rover on the surface. 
I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really, really important, and if we can understand the code, the language of the brain, things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before. Thank you. 
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label. 
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter. 
So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort. 
In those days, this was the height of technology. 
And we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are -- and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other. 
And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose.

It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures, whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on. 
They just didn't think it was the right thing to do. 
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery, that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe, need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling? 
And I thought about that. 
Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger. 
You will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with. 
What will these three billion people bring? 
Just to give you an example from Iran, we all heard about the Twitter revolution that happened there, but if you look close enough, you'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational. 
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation. 
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang. 
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn -- go to the back of the wall -- and just project, and this way you will see exactly what I would see. 
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. 
The highest performing country, Norway, scores 88. 
By the way, it is a story that is told through its hard materials. 
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign. 
My pension was in it. 
So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now, this is the exact first moment she got that. 
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty, very radically fast, in about two to five years. 
Now it's about something else, but it's equally profound. 
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life. 
And the answer is: Yeah, it can. 
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. 
It's an eternal metric. There's an eternal metric about us sort of saying, do we understand the world? Am I making predictions? And so on. 
She started crying. She asked me to call her back. 
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.

My father, who is 92, likes to say, "Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all." 
If I was tired, I drank more espressos. 
We generate quite a lot of waste.

At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan. 
India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees. 
It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" -- literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha." 
Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens, so most of that is already in their DNA, but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds. 
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium. 
Working for a fragrance company. 
He called me to his office and said, "What do you want to do when you grow up?" 
The dog is actually euthanized now, but this was a dog I worked with for a while.

In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants. 
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit. 
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class. 
And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until, within several tens of thousands of years, we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species, with a very small amount of technology. 
I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Malé. 
A few months ago, I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work.

Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. 
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.

Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance. 
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid. 
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly. 
But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily. 
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations, has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean, the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic. 
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium. 
They can operate with small crews. 
Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen. 
Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.

The granny cloud sits over there. 
Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug -- a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. 
This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain. 
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. 
Basically, prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector, but it doesn't generate any jobs. 
Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated. 
And as you go up towards the top of the graph, what you see is each dot is a trial. 
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease. 
And so it doesn't take all of us. 
Here's what the new Main Street looks like. 
There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. 
I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months. 
They can't be 10 miles behind.

(Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? 
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and 45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem, and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases, so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease. 
Now none of these solutions -- the prescription pad, the electronic medical record, the waiting room, the army of college students -- are perfect. 
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents, not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you. 
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light. 
They're acoustically very different.

Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote: Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican, but I don't buy it. 
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said, "What's interesting about you is you." 
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist. 
And we're stepping it up.

Go. 
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers, and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance. 
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. 
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave. 
So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail. 
And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. 
And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people.

How did I not know? 
It's what the woman said to herself. 
There are still no limits. 
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap. 
Just by bringing the very action, that bank has stopped doing it, and indeed, the powers that be around the world, which for real politic reasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue, because there was lots of competing interests, have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system. 
(Applause.) The Hindus say, "Nada brahma," one translation of which is, "The world is sound."

And it is certainly a wonder. 
I read a diary of this poor senator, who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject." 
Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid, or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing. 
He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal. 
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal. 
And they also converge the oil story with our second big story, saving electricity and then making it differently. 
And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys. 
But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all. 
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. 
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece. 
Of course, my work turned ugly, but another thing happened. 
Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually. 
Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A, but certainly not B, C or D, right?

I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand, and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains, because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers." 
It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. 
So a car accident. 
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world. 
IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute. 
It's a fact that is, itself, unseen, yet impossible to vary. Thank you.

For. 
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. 
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances, and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China. 
But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal. 
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars. 
If you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable. 
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. 
For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Bush administration doesn't like. 
Why does Rice play Texas? 
So, it can balance on a point. 
And guess what? That's happening now, finally, partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade. 
When have you been appointed to play God? 
They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east, back into China. 
You've just won a Darwin award. 
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. 
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. 
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors. 
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. 
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. 
We may take the Gaian view. 
(Video) Ground control: We lost the data. 
Well, with the pig, at the baseline, before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal. 
I was launched as a cartoonist. 
CA: But you didn't have him design the engine? 
So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots, 4,000 deployments, a huge herculean task, 2,000 tags in an area, shown here for the first time, off the California coast, that appears to be a gathering place. 
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing, but I realized there were not enough for everyone, so I decided against it. 
This would be a normal wave pattern. 
And I think that's something that we have to be in the room, whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev. 
So we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator, which didn't work out for us, to optimize the Stirling engine, and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar, irrespective of weight, irrespective of size, to get the most conversion of solar energy, because the sun is free. 
Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret, and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd. 
The goal is to control cancer. 
He said, "Consider again that dot. 
Also it's bad news for us. 
This is the language of sterility. 
And the results can be pretty funny. 
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people, and it was the best sign ever to say no. 
And I don't see this as an alternative to civilization. 
No. It's the pipelines. 
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better? 
As we spread out around the world, we developed thousands of different languages. 
There’s a little paper me. And a little paper you. 
But what's the point to being so conspicuous? 
You see, the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. 
So we turn it into flour. 
On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway. 
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment, which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic. 
Everyone's filled something up with water before, so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?" 
You then have some body part descriptions: "It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate." 
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. 
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power. 
This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. 
I was going to work on international development, and then I took a turn and ended up here. 
Artificial retinas, the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see. 
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock. 
And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle. 
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago. 
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. 
So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species, having 46 names in it, its own web address. 
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. 
These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. 
There is a game called Rush Hour. 
Or you can pull them up where you want them. 
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash. 
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art, but of an encyclopedic museum, and today, 140 years later, that vision is as prescient as ever, because, of course, we live in a world of crisis, of challenge, and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 newsreels. 
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men. 
We made a number of discoveries. 
And so it's got everything, right? 
This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected, they could reconnect through this image. 
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament. 
This is 28 hours later in Atlanta. It's a very long flight. 
He's made 30,000 new jobs. 
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. 
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there, but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element, the physical element, of songs off the table. 
And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. 
So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? 
It can know where we are. 
Suddenly, here we are. 
And yet, why is it that, in creative writing courses today, the very first thing we teach students is "write what you know"? 
He's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric. 
Hi. So today, I'd like to share some works in progress. 
How does life make things? 
And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it. 
Okay, hands down. 
The future research is "How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds, without having to plant them every 10 years?" 
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. 
We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products. 
What happened? 
And then they circle around. 
There's a huge -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- there's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders, pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders, people who handle biology with their hands, and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures, plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech, and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology. 
If they had a concept of being true to one's self, then that self, most likely, [was] composed, not of an individual, but of a collective. 
And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes. 
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. 
I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting. 
Can you go there? 
♫ You don't have to be a big star on MTV ♫ ♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see. ♫ ♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫ ♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫ ♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫ ♫ I can make a little difference in this world. ♫ ♫ She can make a little difference in this world. ♫ ♫ He can make a little difference in this world. ♫ ♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫ ♫ we can make a little bit of difference in this world. ♫ 
Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood, a very difficult adolescence -- it had to do with not quite poverty but close. 
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong." 
I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented, and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin. 
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars, but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know, in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of, a little bit of what's going to happen. 
That is what it is for knowledge to count. 
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia, basically. 
I've never made it into a planet, but that's it. 
that's a huge power-generating capability, a mobile power-generating capability. 
And as they land, they're fully aligned in the gravitational field. 
Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side, some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. 
But there is something more profound here, something deeper. 
When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement. 
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance." 
And I said, "Thank you for being here." 
Every day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls, and I do wonder, and I get angry sometimes, yes I do. 
So here we go. This is your senses, pouring into your senses every second. 
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer. 
"If it works, it works, baby. 
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather. 
And we also need to re-examine livestock. 
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. 
As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church, who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that. 
And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More" is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined, as who or what we are against. 
And it was all the people who lived in those homes, were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. 
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. 
Thank you very much. 
He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one." 
It takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done, under general anesthesia. 
LC: Hopefully within the next two years. 
(Applause) I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine. 
Coke is everywhere. 
Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit over there with them." 
Time for development, not 10 years. 
(Laughter) This was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible. 
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour. 
Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate. 
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it. 
That's almost the size of Germany. 
It could happen perhaps through equity. 
The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM, but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands, were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning. 
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors? 
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay. 
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet, but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America, Europe, Japan and other developed parts of the world. 
We went back to the communities and we said we are very ashamed of what we did. 
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. 
and go from this concept of walking, breathing, and then his hands, speak, and ultimately happiness and function. 
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we? 
And do you guys just want to see it? 
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media, thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world, tribes are everywhere. 
We call it dark energy, and it has this effect of causing space to expand. 
(Laughter) And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?" 
You probably saw the humpback whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off County Wexford. 
But nature had its wicked way, and brown babies were born. 
(Laughter) And the facade of the parking, we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated, so we needed to perforate it. 
I can now say, and often do, to any government, in order to do well, you need to do good. 
It may still be, for all I know. 
I was Norman Mark Greenwood. 
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class, believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch. 
EZ: Well, if you are sure, I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast. 
And I said, "This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up." 
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. 
We do that in our solar system. 
And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other. 
And so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s. 
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media, and if you are a banker for independent media. 
Man: I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. 
Hi there. 
(Laughter) RSW: What's his schedule on that? 
Urbanization, integration, coming together, leads to a new renaissance. 
We ask half of them to tell us, "Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?" 
He came within about a second of qualifying. 
So as an example, here's a word. 
You have to be careful about who you're shooting at. 
That's going to spray cells over that area. 
Now because it's student-driven, there's some amazing things that the movement has done. 
But interestingly, this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers. 
The world is alive with musical expression. 
It should be built in to all the systems we use. 
They could not imagine turning that choice over to another, even though having made that choice made them feel trapped, guilty, angry. 
I'm an emotional creature!" 
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts. 
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed. 
He had a huge ambition. 
There were double pirate watches. 
And so for many years, I feared that my father would die before I had a chance to kill him. 
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image: the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds, contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints. 
I found out afterwards, after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank. 
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn, or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. 
They haven't given up on government. 
Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons. 
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves. 
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — (Laughter) — but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said, "Yes, I will." 
And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right? 
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. 
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication, the change in him was amazing. 
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, "Is there anybody out there?" 
Well, we have to come up with a partnership between academia, government, the private sector, and patient organizations to make that so. 
Or is it Mena Trott? 
So I want you to imagine a world, in 2050, of around nine billion people, all aspiring to Western incomes, Western lifestyles. 
For example, I want to use Zipcar. 
And did I want to come with? 
I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now. 
They had no stone tools. 
(Laughter) (Applause) SM: So you know what's happened? 
They didn't do this with a computer. 
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria. 
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola. 
♫ Now everybody sings ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ You're okay ♫ ♫ You'll be fine ♫ ♫ Just breathe ♫ Thank you. 
Now I had people in Washington last week told me, he said, "The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel. 
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again, and as a result, working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts, we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press, with the strongest journalistic protections in the world, with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. 
This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true, then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. 
His psychological health was amazing. 
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice? 
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then, enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. 
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. 
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard. 
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from." 
How are you going to find meaning in your crappy experience? 
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything. 
But that they're really all market driven, and what's driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts. 
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia, so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube, I can easily picture how he did it. 
(Laughter) That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the "E" part of TED: its own entertainment industry. 
The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. 
The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem since we were kids. 
Robert Kennedy once said that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events." 
Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? 
They can't escape from that water. They can't fly. 
Why is this not like colonialism? 
The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks, killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. 
This next video clip, you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. 
And yet, nobody listened to them. 
And this is in 1993. 
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute. 
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins? 
We all looked up to him. 
And you become trapped into this kind of representation. 
The walls are this thick. 
So lunch is coming along, and I think I will stop at that point, before I get selected out. 
And it'll come out dark but red, and then you can start to read it rather clearly. 
That is not enough. 
They had to be very quiet. 
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. 
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because, if you start with a talking shark, readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. 
So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do, it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that. 
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour. 
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. 
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean. 
And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter) At all. I mean, the women should be paid as much as the men. 
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking. 
"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses, as in lip-smacking, but that can lead to "smack" as in "hit" as in domestic abuse, because sexual attraction can seem threatening. 
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's. 
They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So what they did is they started to change their packaging. 
Today at the micro- and nanoscales, there's an unprecedented revolution happening. 
For the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything, thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. 
Because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other. 
An example would be in "Finding Nemo," in the short tension, you were always worried, would Dory's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin. 
Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. 
And by 1950, they were everywhere. 
And in many ways, the law has worked. 
We have some students coming, and they are all learning Koran, Holy Book. 
Dubbed "femme fatales" by Jim Lloyd, another colleague, these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species. 
(Applause) Growth is not dead. 
(Explosion) All right, all right. 
And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. 
You cannot turn them off with a switch. 
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. 
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably. 
Let's start with government data. 
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. 
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. 
So Jains are not supposed to eat meat. 
And the question is, should we run them or not? 
We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey, one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies. 
It would be very dangerous if you fell down. 
Here, but -- (Applause) -- anyway. 
As of next week, it will soon be available. 
And yet, on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947, Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility, and in so doing, he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound. 
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about? 
Quieted the train. 
Well, the first and most obvious reason is because that's what we ask them to do. 
But in addition, there's something else. 
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this. 
So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders, which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life. 
When composers write music for me, I ask them to forget what they know about the cello. 
Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular, and people would bring them, parents would bring them, to their kids' football games to film their kids play football. And since this came in on a Friday, they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. 
And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel. 
And when he hit send, he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make. 
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five. 
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents. 
It's a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm. 
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. 
And you don't have to agree when you sit down with the other side. 
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play. 
This kid is known online as Lil Demon. 
I still find it very romantic. 
(Laughter) It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course. 
And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? 
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have. 
(Laughter) The other thing The New Yorker plays around with is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you, is sort of the basis of humor. 
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. 
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- (Applause) Thank you. 
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. 
Because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system, we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that, and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon. 
Well, so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out who changed, and where did they go? 
This is what gives us the hopeless image. 
We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year. 
So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on, he selects basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is -- and he presses this blue button called "sonicate." 
(Laughter) Or a virgin for a sacrifice? 
I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers. 
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico. 
When you look at a penis in cross section, it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton. 
These are not good enough for Americans. 
He didn't say we didn't even have a theory. He says, we don't even know how to begin to think about it -- we don't even have a framework. 
So even after a 10-year census, there are large areas that still remain unexplored. 
The larger context of this is that are two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today. 
Well how else can we create new ideas? 
Now if you like any of those outcomes, you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. 
(Applause). 
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes. 
Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. 
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with, because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs. 
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit. 
were kids. Little did I think our children would be playing instruments, you know, playing music, yeah." 
So he would come to the first bar, the second bar and then the third bar, and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through, and come back, third, second, first. And he would grab my pinkie, because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit. 
I was a little prone to depression. 
Any meaningful sort of thing. 
And if you were to ask me to describe myself, I'd probably say some of those same things. 
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. 
It varies a bit province to province. 
I'm not saying they're broken. 
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. 
There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains." 
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are. 
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. 
We're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market. 
A curious little invention is being talked about. 
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew. 
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. 
So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation. 
To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. 
You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup, or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it. 
Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head. 
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"? 
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit. 
But through science, we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. 
And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light. 
And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one. 
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. 
This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world, even with its 84k of memory. 
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before. 
And in South Africa, we had taken our innovators, and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have. 
I had never heard the word Amerasian before. 
But nowhere else anyway. 
Here it is in a flat floor configuration. 
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was. 
You can use statistics, or you can use stories. 
To find three is completely weird. 
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line. 
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now. 
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?" 
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water, which was interesting. 
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was. 
We also have seven-day executive programs. 
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby," and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head, so my own version. 
TS: The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism, so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. 
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom. 
And then we asked them how happy they are again. 
So take all that together. 
She said, "Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world." 
And, over time, we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about, because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
My life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles. 
♫ I believe the almighty knows each and every one of you ♫ ♫ by your name ♫ ♫ Women of hope ♫ ♫ Women of change ♫ ♫ Women of love, joy, no shame ♫ ♫ You've got something this little life ♫ ♫ can never take away ♫ ♫ Running through the darkness of night ♫ ♫ with a child by her side ♫ ♫ Oh Lord, won't you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ Oh Lord, won't you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ Daybreak brings a sign of new life ♫ 
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. 
Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope. 
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass -- that's not so hot. 
You can try to -- you know, if you watch the movies, you might think about, why don't we use a nuclear weapon? 
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again? 
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. 
It's a debate about words, about metaphors. 
All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work. 
A very simple definition. 
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. 
A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. 
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled. 
He's a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should I say it? -- it's called pain in the butt. 
(Gasps) I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. 
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place. 
(Laughter) OK. So most people think B is true. 
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. 
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license. 
If you think about it, every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo. 
Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination? 
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you. 
As the juveniles are growing up, their horns actually curve backwards. 
He said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed. 
So the question is, can we study these diseases using human material? 
When do you see the dragonflies appear? 
(Laughter) So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor. 
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform. 
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing. 
For my second project, I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before. 
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors that we're in denial about, and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness. 
Boy: About the second one. 
They got married five years ago, and now they have two-year-old twins. 
And that line there is a prediction from the same theory, based on the same principles, that describes that forest. 
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results, so I'm just going to talk to you about one. 
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games. 
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this: "The foolish man built his house upon the sand / And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash." 
Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. 
And all I've got is a box of slides." 
Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? 
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break." 
So this is the leading killer of women. 
This is extremely important for the end of my talk. 
CA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly, and there haven't been that many planes built since that flap wings. 
It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows. 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. 
And if the demo gods are willing, in about 10 seconds or so we should see it. 
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit, which is just the individual shelter module. 
And he's never been back to his country since. 
Now you might wonder, should you care? 
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate. 
(Laughter) Right. (Laughter) The New York Senate has put up something called Open Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub, again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity. 
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II. 
Let's do this. Thank you. 
And then this happened. 
It's significant to us. 
Daniel Kahneman: Sure. 
And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. 
We currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines, and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like. 
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking, and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing. 
This is project called Ray. 
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going, "Why would I conceivably care about this?" 
They're incredibly safe, weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it. 
And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles. 
So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. 
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure. 
I'm left-handed, and so I draw. 
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this, given that we can? 
So I should start to talk about these guys. 
This is an old bicycle tube, which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins. 
She was in a great evening gown. 
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. 
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels. 
By 2010, I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. 
Their answer was interesting. 
So I asked him, "What is that?" 
And so, in a way, the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in, goes through the set of equations, and out comes streams of electrical pulses, just like a normal retina would produce. 
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end, so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol. 
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor. 
And that was done with a particle from my shirt. 
This potential is not for the lucky few. 
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable. 
And also telling it like now. 
We like to make things. It's fun to make things. 
Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling. 
But my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly. 
And that's what it looks like, here. 
And so, that's a hard way to look at things, so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode, grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way. 
So unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman, but it does have severe, profound if you will, implications to her family. 
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale. 
And so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them. 
You believed in impossible things and you were fearless. 
Not even worth it. 
And it's the very same people leading Wall Street firms who, on Sundays, show up and share. 
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice. 
And then we produced "You suck." 
So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. 
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures. 
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. 
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. 
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. 
It does concern you, as well. 
Now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth, you can see here that we have the arrows going into the Mid-East and away from us. 
Back in 1980 when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident, I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that. 
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit Creative Commons. 
Because I was so poor, I wanted to rent an office in Paris, but I couldn't afford it, so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves. 
He can't walk. Anybody know the story? 
And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements -- three-, four, five-thousand years old. 
(Laughter) Some people say 9/11 heals the rift -- jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history, drags them down in to the muck and says, "You want a networked opponent? 
I wish for her to be a nurse." 
A nice one, because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places, is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste, and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil. 
One of these mechanisms is transparency, telling people what you are going to do with their data. 
So it's the demand that brings them to the table. 
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature, there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them. 
The basis of human trust is established through play signals. 
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts. 
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. 
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, like in this case. 
When you walked into those rooms, they smelled really bad, and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. 
And we were unprepared for this, and they were shaping the aid effort. 
And they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows, but at night, they go off the edge and hunt in deep water. 
That's what we like, hockey sticks. 
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that. 
You have to remember that this is not a real island. 
And I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors." 
Our democracies rely on elections. 
That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history. 
And then, you come back to me. 
It transcends nation, the gender, the age. 
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral, so that, even if you're partially-sighted, that it was kind of crunchy and soft, that piece of landscape that you see there. 
The answer is, we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities, in partnership with development agencies. 
For me, the issue about aid -- I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid. 
You've got to get your chemical into every puddle, every birdbath, every tree trunk. 
And it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease, despite these good treatments that we know and we have work. 
Why is water important? Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. 
She said, "No, look, look closely, you're in his eyes." 
It is going to change absolutely everything. 
Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health? 
I recall very much the Climate March last September, and that was a huge momentum, not just in New York, but all around the world. 
I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point. I said, as I say to all of you, I'm on Facebook. Friend me. 
And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. 
But according to a really great science historian you might know, Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard -- what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest, this real passion for design. 
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them. 
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff. 
This is a figure from an editorial that I published in the European Heart Journal this last summer. 
What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist, I could change something, that even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered, and your voice matters too. 
My Talk today is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons, why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way, shape or form. 
And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. 
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable. 
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. 
I don't know exactly how to do this yet, but, you know, it's something being actively thought about. 
And if you're not an American citizen, you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. 
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot." 
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples. 
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration. 
Then there's the liger. 
So I guess I was the lucky one. 
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named. 
Take a breath now. 
(Laughter) You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman. 
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. 
I do a radio show. 
And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world. 
What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. 
But for us, the rain is good. 
So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people. 
This is the clown skull. 
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. 
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain. 
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to. 
And so this microbial diversity differs between people, and what people have been thinking about in the last 10, maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes, this microbial cloud in and on us, and the variation between us, may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us. 
There it is, and it survives. 
After a lag, productivity accelerated again. 
Now, similarly, the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it, it would be expensive, or we would have done it already, because markets are essentially perfect. 
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building, I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it, because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic? 
It had been presumed before. 
MM: The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this. 
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. 
The data is all stored in a Google Doc, and it's literally generating itself from that data. 
So, this is CLIMBeR. 
They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients. 
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency. 
The challenge of looking at nature's designs -- and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it. 
It's a stretch of beach we know so well. 
Ethics requires thinking. 
Consider the great problem of women's bodies: What to do about them? 
Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother. 
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects. 
This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin, because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general, do not focus enough, yet, on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society. 
And that would be a perfectly sensible response. 
It's created a million jobs inside that country, and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial. 
Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. 
Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet. 
We live where we want to be -- at least in the West. 
Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park. 
The music works perfectly in that setting. 
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500. 
You add other forms of innovation and processor design, you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year. 
So the gains from trade are only going to grow. 
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business, but, in fact, it's negative. 
I knew Craig and respected him. 
By this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee. 
Well, when you start working on issues like plastic, you realize that the whole thing is connected, and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms. 
Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said, "By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else." 
So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. 
All the young people, actually, from the city. 
Remember, 2001, we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. 
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world. 
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. 
But then I began to think of other things. 
He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places. 
Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men. 
Not all species on our planet have brains, so if we want to know what the brain is for, let's think about why we evolved one. 
This is an image I just recently completed, that is -- when you stand back at a distance, it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution. 
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory. 
The threat, in fact, is this inversion of the burden of proof, where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create, to produce or to share. 
And then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them. 
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them. 
So, okay my time is up. 
The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it, and the investigation is going on. 
Let's think about probability. 
These are the blue bars. 
So we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them. 
(Laughter) Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. 
It’s the molecule that has made men’s fragrances smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact. 
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago, but things have changed. 
It's something that I call ¡No MAS! 
You need a place where people can come together, sit down without fear of judgment, without recrimination, to actually face the problem, agree on the problem and come up with solutions. 
And then, there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. 
This is coming from the heart of finance. 
So in conclusion, we know where Yellowstone is for North America; it's off our coast. 
Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections. 
How can we help you? 
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the human genome. 
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. 
First, we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry, and employment has gone up, because innovation is fundamentally about growth. 
But if you saw this protocell, you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. 
We see it in the Caribbean. 
And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor, the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness, it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination. 
But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You, where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. 
And so I went on. 
Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country? 
And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it. 
Think of France and the current debate about immigration. 
They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial. 
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something. 
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle. 
(Music: "Happy Together") So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT, Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. 
You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. 
This is it. 
And I made these very lush, very elaborate record covers, not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because I didn't know what those things were. 
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file, plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
You know, that it's not just enough to survive. 
It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot. 
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data. 
Look at that lovely, black shark slime. 
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought: What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world? 
We count on people. 
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers. 
So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit," look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog. 
This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid. 
Now watch out, stay away from them now. 
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people, that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well? 
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months. 
If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it? And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. 
MK: This is a couple months ago. 
So for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight. 
What can we do to create shared prosperity? 
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. 
National polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation. 
Is it because women don't look like men, they don't look like that male-pattern heart disease that we've spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics, and therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease. 
You sit in a gas station all day, you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you. 
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels. 
And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds, a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models, like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models. 
But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system. 
Today, nurses spend an average of 21 minutes per shift looking for medical equipment. 
We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut, and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint." 
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies, for example. 
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain? 
(Applause) Ever since I was a little girl seeing "Star Wars" for the first time, I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. 
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them, so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes -- live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows, and the windows were all steamed up. 
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design, and it is miles away from the fancy furniture, but still, it's part of my same field of passion. 
Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people? 
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that, again completing the life cycle, you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this. 
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. 
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up, within a few days she was looking like a completely different person. 
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger." 
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea, but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her. 
We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles, and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. 
These problems are both technically solvable. 
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. 
So, would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency? 
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio, and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time. 
JC: And does it ever change? 
But in America you have to explain. What are clubs? 
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s. 
And I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004. 
Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? -- When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen. 
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time. 
But how? 
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto, and not have to re-invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life's work, to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are. 
It is not an event for the solo runner. 
And so the really cool bit is, the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer, and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device. 
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain, which is just turning around there. 
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently. 
Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. 
EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage. 
Point is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds. 
For 0.01 percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains, which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey, but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more. 
(Laughter) Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. 
He's in his study, it's October of 1838, and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population. 
Sometimes it's even 100 percent, much more than many privileged schools. 
And the dragonflies you can see today outside here, on the campus, are the young of this generation. 
So maybe you could interview her." 
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. 
And he told them, "Question the unquestionable. 
She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics and then sent her home. 
Marketing is selling an ad to a firm. 
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. 
But the idea is that the ants are in there, and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants. 
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. 
And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks. 
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power. 
The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner, because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. 
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. 
You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. 
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why? 
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. 
Discard the first myth; it is a crime. 
I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust. 
Okay, so how do you do that? 
They forced us to learn things like Latin. 
And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us. 
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery: surgery with long instruments through small incisions. 
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task, but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that I think, if we understand, we can really move forward. 
It's very complicated to explain. 
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. 
[Science for the public good] Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain. 
Imagine you had one second per product category. 
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton -- that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out, if the extra dimensions are real. 
And also, as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change, they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef, which will contaminate their fresh water supply. 
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. 
And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired -- if I want to explore the world with Romo, I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. 
I could have told them that. 
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China. 
This is the map of the whole Earth and again, you can see a huge swathe in the middle of pretty much where a large part of the population is, there's tremendous chances for solar energy. 
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing, that man can invent things that nature did not know. 
They require very similar mathematics. 
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000. 
This is a cama. 
(Applause) Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball," or have read the book by Michael Lewis, will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane. 
There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs. 
So our patients are women and children. 
(Laughter) You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. 
So I thought, a biennial needs artists. 
DNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that. 
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy, or because there are no telescopes available to do it. 
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist, that you are an anthropologist photographer, that you are an activist photographer. 
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. 
This is a city that's wanting to do something about it." 
But when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes, indeed, the car seats don't perform as well. 
But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. 
This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes. 
But the young people all came. 
If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions, you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. 
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. 
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would. 
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. 
Baseline levels are near zero, without some stimulus to cause its release. 
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other. 
Now I would do very small ones, which would be like -- but under the same light, and I would show them together, so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking. 
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. 
The right to live, period. 
Most of the time, feeling and reality are the same. 
And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips -- Hyun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha, which I understood was from her watching a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon on the American Air Force station. 
Which was he? 
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts." 
Thanks. 
We need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it. 
And you know, it's just one of the great things about being a musician, is that it is so unbelievably fluid. 
It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing. 
What are the virtues, the aspirations that you're actually expressing in that? 
We're going to explain that right now. 
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners; Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture; the whole of the hunting issue, and the royal family refusing to stop hunting; and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry; Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting; Condi and Bush. 
And now we want to share. That's the next step. 
In fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. 
The free-riders have taken over. 
The talk will be broadly about energy, but oil's a good place to start. 
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air. 
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship." 
I am an emotional creature. 
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out. 
Well, let's think about it this way. 
And a year after that, we did conquer it. 
So can we have that second? 
But rather all of these different practices -- you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn’t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. 
And so there won't be any workforce. 
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. 
(Laughter) We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. 
And we've started to work on things. 
That's a great question. 
And I want to know how the money you're going to get from me is going to help you get there. 
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy, and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy. 
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water. 
The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. 
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is. 
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around, and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter) So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around, and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance, and we know that these species here actually count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer, a step-counting system, to find their way back home. 
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant, what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission. 
And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. 
Other countries come with different things. 
I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit, but first I want to take a look at how we got here. 
What I found out is that the tooling, if you intervened in the software, actually produced decorative effects. 
There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again. 
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message. 
Does that make sense? 
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine. 
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in. 
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people. 
But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. 
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking. 
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. 
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night, and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep -- I was excited, with this phone call. 
(Laughter) So, these are miracles, right? 
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them -- before, it was 256. 
Now, fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive. 
You wouldn't have any... 
These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. 
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter. 
Thank you. 
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. 
Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music? 
So I immediately decided, this is going to be the name of the game, or my new exclamation. 
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well. 
So the last iteration of this project has been called Flow, with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world; really looking, not so much from Harlem and out, but looking across, and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa. 
(Laughter) CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK. 
Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude, which we did not expect. 
So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into 16 pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. 
This is Vannevar Bush. 
(Laughter) So right now, you see, I love little robots. 
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our -- many young people think she's still alive. 
Car colors, exterior car colors -- I've got 56 choices. 
It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be. 
So having seen this work, worked a little bit on this, this is where I came in. 
By focusing on a design, maybe just a single product, I was being incremental and not having much of an impact. 
The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer. 
Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic, others are a little slower, others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. 
It's our invisible reality. 
(Music) (Applause) Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run "S-Curve music?" 
The reason the problem has gotten worse, rather than better, is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. 
An aspen needs fire and dry soils. 
And in certain very high-security areas, perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. 
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland, and we have repeat photography positions, that is places we just visit on an annual basis, in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia. 
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide. 
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale, but the Egyptians never bought it. 
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. 
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have. 
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass." 
(Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics, which actually does extensive research into perception of things, and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people, there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is, in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. 
Many technical details to be worked out, but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock, there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination, that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution. 
Brilliant. 
And at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird. 
And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world, colleague universities, to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world. 
They can't solve all of the world's problems, but I think they have something important to teach us. 
In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about? 
And unlike anything else we've just seen, virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected. 
And so the net effect of all 250 of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for. 
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences, private-based learning. 
And now I show the number of babies per woman here: two, four or six -- many babies, few babies. 
So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. 
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating. 
From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. 
And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. 
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power. 
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon. 
And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. 
You take all of the conflict, all of the chaos, all of the noise, and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict. 
None of the work is my work. It's all work that my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk. 
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical. 
And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy." 
So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention, but it exists. 
Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans. 
And it's a made-up word. 
And it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one. 
This is Sydney, who's going to be three years old in a couple of days. 
This is our one-page summary. 
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it. 
But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent, including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue -- in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net. 
We get jealous, not because we're evil, but because we have little artists pent up inside us. 
Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years. 
Thank you. 
Now we have three years to do something else. 
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because, women, we care a great deal about being thin and good looking, whereas men mostly care about sex ... 
And then this is the first part of -- this is 109 spheres, since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth. 
This kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas, and I'm going to tell you one more little story. 
Now just think about that. 
All the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
It is burned into my memory. 
Rather, it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits, so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain. 
And what you're seeing here is, again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills. 
And one of my favorites has always been, "Make love to your man in a Chevy van," because that was my vehicle when I was in college. 
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. 
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. 
So, natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage. 
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor. 
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. 
The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. 
This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology. 
And you look at them, and you see how they are. 
Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here. 
The first is redistribution markets. 
I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. 
This is extremely practical, but not so awesome. 
And again this didn't make sense to me. 
You, like the people that are trapped in my work — (Blender noises, laughter) — have become part of my work as well. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) But, but this seems a bit unfair, right? 
(Applause). 
RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case. 
JH: Other questions? Right here. 
But that's not all. 
Three generations ago, we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people. 
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio, where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities, and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable. 
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. 
The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy." 
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. 
This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. 
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup. 
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. 
Of course, we can't know what's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty. 
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps. 
KB: Yeah. 
Now, 60 years later, I'm here to tell you why it's possible. 
And this outer layer, this is the vasculature, which is incredible, around a human brain. 
For so long, I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't six foot tall and athletic and bearded. 
(Applause) Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me. 
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability. 
To our surprise, one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum. 
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us. 
But the conditions for compassion to be activated, to be aroused, are particular conditions. 
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it, and other parts are much more energetic and intense. 
That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. 
That's how scared of the jellyfish I was. 
They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it. 
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. 
And so we, in the mixing process, have to develop the gluten, we have to activate the leaven or the yeast, and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly. 
If, however, the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed, the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for Egypt, but for the entire region. 
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. 
During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo. 
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation, and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body. 
And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. 
About the 50th hour, I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. 
In the '60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's. 
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around, you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about -- that's like the grid part -- but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. 
And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a set up. 
You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there, and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there. 
They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country, and they proved that being an American is not just for some people, that race is not how we define being an American. 
Well, I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has, in fact, seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. 
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. 
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them, and what I'm going to try and show is that actually, victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism. 
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot. 
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me. 
What is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes. 
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. 
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. 
And we went to Ladakh, and we asked this woman -- this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof, because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman, "What was the benefit you had from solar electricity?" 
Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson, the Space Shuttle Endeavour, the one that I was the commander on its last flight, on its final flight on top of an airplane on a 747 on its way to L.A., NASA was kind enough to have it fly over Tucson. 
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. 
Every time you think of a city, you've got to think green. 
Unfortunately here -- and, really, regrettably -- first of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically. 
We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing. 
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good. 
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil, because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years, when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. 
India, the world champions. 
We love to circle around things. 
We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity, agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed, and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer. 
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface. 
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review, kind of trying to convince you they were there. 
In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things. 
Yeah, good. 
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA, I think it should be under CDC. 
So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction. 
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well. 
And we can network between domes and classrooms. 
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity. 
This chart is going to document a very similar trend. 
When we got down to the mouth of the glacier, we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses. 
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20. 
We could run really far on a hot day. 
And I'm able to learn a lot from it. 
So do you still not want to continue?" 
So littleBits is open-source. 
So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the 19th century. 
So let me just start with my story. 
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter. 
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction. 
He has produced some power generators, which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh, in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas, which is running these generators. 
And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us; it's the look in Fraser's eyes. 
Sadly, it's metaphorically true. 
You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight. 
And how about the long run? 
And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service, his system was called NLS for oN-Line System. 
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that? 
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. 
The first problem that we're facing is human health. 
I said, "Something's wrong here." 
Glenn Gould, 1955. 
My father was born in 1885, and he was mildly racially biased. 
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' (Laughter) And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college, and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything. 
And it just so happened, on the fifth week, there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. 
This is one from Yorkshire where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it. 
And since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech. 
Now, choices are anxiety-provoking. 
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips. 
It was he who penned the well-known words, "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of." 
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas. 
And this is what came to me. 
They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars, which is a pretty great thing. 
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry, and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war. 
It's extremely beautiful. 
Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. 
The idea was to have -- the same principal, a divided country -- take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. 
And if you look at California, they use 2,500 buses. 
We see a transformation in attendance by girls. 
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second, it would have taken five hours to show you that number. 
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that. 
Now if movement is so important, how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement? 
I study maths. I write poetry. 
And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own. 
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio, and now you can see, those curves match perfectly. 
It's a very large number of galaxies. 
I mean, imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet. 
I mean, if I just go through some of them now -- I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects, and that does it consummately well, you can see it can. 
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do? 
(Laughter) We go on blind dates. 
You set the fracture, you drew the blood, you spun the blood, looked at it under the microscope, you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum. 
And later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so, went out of Africa to colonize the rest of the world. 
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well. 
Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production of these new neurons. 
You have, in effect, lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. 
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. 
So that doesn't really work. 
Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. 
But we dug our heels and said, "We're not in the number game. 
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. 
Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage, and so I'd been told the conditions were much better. 
But we have to figure out how we can get people in the capital markets, who traditionally don't invest in this stuff, to want to invest in this stuff. 
And because they're made of natural materials, they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard. 
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect. 
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED. 
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. 
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story. 
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it. 
So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own. 
No foldouts, no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way. 
The people who just last sat down. 
She was 105 years old when I took this picture. 
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form. 
And it seems like it's very possible that your nation, despite, actually because of the intense problems you face, you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly, most powerfully. 
And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination. 
And what you see here, or what you don't really see normally, is that these are the physics of culture. 
Here are some recent images. 
Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out, one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest-energy jet emission comes from. 
Neural activity is its water, and the connectome is its bed. 
In order to create, we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for, looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak, at war, at death. 
And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. 
There was no inflation. 
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists. 
The last place I visited was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras. 
(Laughter) Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.) David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky. 
This is a disaster. 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. 
So there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time. 
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right." 
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out, which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected. 
Don't take anything for granted. 
If you live up here, in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down, but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere, and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out, and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter. 
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term. 
But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question, and that is, when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting or 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine, will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine? 
And this is only one of the conditions that's out there. 
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room, 20 percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear. 
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac, for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. 
It was able to do that itself. 
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it." 
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. 
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring. 
The inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it's basically a quantum world. 
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. 
You can sleep in clean sheets. 
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine. 
First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket -- (Laughter) and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in. 
There is first, the present self. 
And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. 
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged. 
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen, to deceive you, to show that you, too, can make assumptions. 
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?" 
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact. 
You zoom in. You really go in. 
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate. 
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. 
And so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016 for every country in the world. 
The county seat is Windsor. 
We had a pajama party. 
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists, we had opera singers, we had guitar players, and we had rap singers. 
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. 
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries, making them into the catacombs. 
Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane. 
There's crackdowns on the press. 
Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year, and after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria, ended up stuck in Calais, bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England. 
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. 
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans, a heavily African-American space. 
In 1975, Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University. 
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar, because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine, but actually the powder was poison. 
(Whistling) The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully. 
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. 
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this. 
(Laughter) World championship final -- women. 
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian, I just thought about that. 
This is "Break Clustered." 
And a more recent one: "The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. 
Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America, you click the "I want it in Spanish" button and out it comes in real time in Spanish. 
(Laughter) I could see they were looking for the schedule, to see when they could get out. 
In our country, it's the kids that need it the most, who get this really, really lousy food. 
But it's basically -- you can pull one out of a billion. 
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters. 
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle. 
(Laughter) "... somebody's gla -- hand." 
We think the things we make can solve our problems, but our problems are much more complex than that. 
It's about retelling the story of the poor, and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity, validates a partnership relationship, not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. 
This was my father in Vietnam. 
100 billion. How many can we see? Five. 
(Singing) I'll stop it there in the interest of time. 
If you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh." 
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT, and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed, specific scientific communication between experts, but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds. 
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma. 
And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table, and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass." 
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s. 
We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called JQ1. 
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa. 
(Applause) I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. 
So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts -- in children it's much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you. 
This is something that's a little bit unusual. 
We basically gave children a very simple challenge. 
I went to see the movie "Dune," and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face -- (Laughter) -- this is impossible on its face, I realize -- but it is absolutely true. 
So nature works on many levels here. 
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you. 
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers? 
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days. 
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways, but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government. 
It's not even online. It's not even streaming. 
Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag, while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero, there was like a handful of tweets written. 
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles, you fly 37,000 feet. 
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. 
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics. 
They're starting to invest in materials science, but these are the new things in materials science. 
But we are many more. 
You know, you create power, then you tame it. 
They don't have any legal rights. 
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built. 
But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees -- then one or two, three, and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects. 
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. 
And unless we address this invisibility, we are going to get the results that we are seeing, which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. 
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar, and he had developed a firm stance against corruption, even though he was harassed and threatened. 
And that was exciting -- that was fun. 
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner. 
We can prevent most cancers. 
"I got this on some trading locally, but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap." 
It was 6.8. 
I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. 
So, certainly the challenge was there. 
And so in the fall of 1771, James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart. 
Now sometimes when people see this, I hear this gasp. 
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial. 
The big growth industry are these. 
But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. 
And so I decided I’d better do this for another day, and another day, and another day until finally, I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more. 
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong. 
And I learned two interesting things. 
And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat. 
We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many, that in the natal lifetimes, I don't see us exhausting the stories we have. 
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition. 
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. 
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is -- (Laughter) -- it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me. 
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic, otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City. 
So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team. 
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid. 
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. 
It's about helping people to build lives of dignity, stability, economic autonomy, citizenship. 
All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together. 
We have many intuitions in our life, and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong. 
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. 
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. 
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed. 
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up. 
♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫ ♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫ ♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫ ♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫ ♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫ ♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫ ♫ I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then ♫ ♫ I was no longer alone. ♫ ♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫ 
You have to fight for it every day. 
The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. 
The big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope. 
It was those two considerations, among others -- reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility -- that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo. 
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000. 
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms. 
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects -- like that silver one there, that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets, trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. 
And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that, absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. 
I suppose we are." 
(Applause) DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. 
We just have to persevere." 
What happens when that arrow goes awry? 
One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine. 
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago, published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus, a giant mushroom. 
So we can work with geneticists who understand that. 
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet, they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes, they'll be able to come into a microfocus. 
Thank you. 
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students. 
I mean, this story, in many ways, just seems beyond belief. 
But just looking up with the naked eye, you really don't need one. 
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies -- those are the galaxies in the cluster. 
That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors. 
From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things. 
circuit boards of the future. 
These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues, who were in the coordination business for profit. 
Take out those who say they save too little. 
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia. 
And then gradually gentrifies. 
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources. 
So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle. 
The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image. 
Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries, and then predict the next day's price trend. 
But he doesn't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own. 
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking. 
The rivers changed in response to the wolves, and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often, so that the rivers became more fixed in their course. 
But Mary went further. 
And so it is sort of a theme, but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that. 
One certainly can't argue with those numbers. 
It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better. 
They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings to move water up without pumps. 
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. 
But you can see those spikes, and they're there. 
My son still had his dad. 
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy, when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model. 
Also, research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty, endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems. 
So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made over and over again. 
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work. 
And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" 
And believe it or not, that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script. 
MK: Yeah, Gabby, she used to race motorcycles. 
It actually takes things we would consider waste -- things like seed husks or woody biomass -- and can transform them into a chitinous polymer, which you can form into almost any shape. 
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups. 
But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern. 
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. 
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better. 
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. 
This is insanity. 
It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time, and you get the Grand Canyon. 
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep? 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you! 
And yet, our lives are complex. 
And this is one of those initiates. 
Fifty percent will have onset by age 14, 75 percent by age 24, a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease, diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality. 
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations. 
It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito, and it's the same disease. You're at risk. 
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about -- (Laughter) -- it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. 
The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience. 
So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory, using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives, you maximally both excite, stimulate, are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data. 
These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags, the message will be carried up to the gods, and that year, Beck's message was answered. 
It's just something we fly over, a patch of blue on an airline map. 
A woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section to save her life and the life of her baby. 
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality. 
(Laughter) CE: All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. 
And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components. 
So in some cases, we can abolish totally the need for manual labor. 
And this will be my only comment on it. 
There are a lot of free concerts, for example, that go on in this area; it has a phenomenal acoustic system. 
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. 
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. 
They were all 3D printed. 
With perfectly trimmed cuticles, dressed in something suitable. 
Now, we have a rationale for that. 
But who's counting? 
And if you're then interested in the history of a piece of DNA, or the whole genome, you can reconstruct the history of the DNA with those differences you observe. 
Do it well and get used to it. 
We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. 
And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do. 
And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe. 
(Applause) Server: May I help you, sir? 
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime, he wasn't the only guy searching. 
And they're both implausible. 
But we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists, that we have a duty to be part of that solution. 
But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church. 
I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me. 
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. 
Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. 
And we look, and we find, as you would expect, a contrast in the landscape where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way. 
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in." 
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? 
That's the area. 
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think. 
Thank you. 
Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers. 
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. 
It was incredible. 
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s. 
So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago, and to work through venture capital on the innovative side, and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems. 
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. 
But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. 
And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment. 
An artist, I think, can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives. 
When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself. 
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle, plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. 
When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. 
When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. 
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. 
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on. 
At that point, what's going to happen? 
So we live in the boonies. 
So you get a big squeeze. 
And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. 
Mandela, the great man Mandela. 
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements, which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back. 
But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power, you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. 
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK? 
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits, we can have both. 
Greater subjective well-being. 
This is not a new question. 
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project. 
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it. 
But we've only started talking about inactivity, and how inactivity born of our landscape, inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk, is driving our weight up. 
You might recognize him from the previous demos. 
Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. 
He's like an underwater Spiderman. 
Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. 
Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them. 
So if you're in drug discovery, for example, you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. 
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. 
We have opportunities in housing and real estate. 
And we want to learn other languages. 
I wanna talk to Randi. 
Information technology progresses through a series of S-curves where each one is a different paradigm. 
As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things I've ever, ever done in my whole life, was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York. 
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day and I've been doing it for two years, trying to change how we feed kids in America. 
But Abed did not slow, and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke, and again, I was left without anger. 
This is so I can share my experiences with others. 
But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time, not get bogged with numbers, and actually see the child complete the circle of life, and unleash his total potential. 
We have some other data where they play across computers. 
(Laughter) I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. 
You look around at all these museums here. 
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on. 
(Applause) Let me tell you a story. 
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width. 
And then we said, well, you're going to feed him, and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated. 
Diver 2: Uh, silvertip sharks. 
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before. 
It's connected to, what I call, the principle of computational equivalence, which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything. 
She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children. 
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why? And finally, would you be able to -- and you can sort of scribble it, if you like -- scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets' orbits? 
Now that, I suggest, is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. 
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned. 
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. 
In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt. 
I don't know what else to tell you. 
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned? 
I was especially concerned of what the girls might think. 
And we all look forward to those things. 
Let me tell you why. 
TS: Yes, they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. 
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer. 
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square, I thought it was 12 years. 
It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere. 
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope, there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people. 
Beethoven is adored in Japan. 
(Laughter) And as you take a close-up of this galaxy, you find a relatively normal, not particularly interesting star. 
And those questions all have variables to them. 
Japan here was regarded as an exception.

Now think what this means. 
(Video) (Mechanical Sounds) ♫ And that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ And we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ That it only ♫ (Laughter) AS: Storytelling without dialogue. 
You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion, the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others, and take universal responsibility for them. 
And he said, "You know, I'm the lucky guy at this table. 
The surgeon is sitting at a console, and controlling the robot with these controllers. 
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak. 
Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom, but where everyone is, and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet, and what they're buying based on their purchases. 
And you know what else we did? 
It became computerish; we began to think computerish -- the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation. 
This is something called a splint. 
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. 
Have you seen these guys? 
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent. 
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi. 
Just before we jump into that, there's sort of a question of: why is this important? 
And one of the issues is capacity. 
(Laughter) But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. 
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway? 
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do. 
We'll get rid of the ones that don't." -- when a politician campaigns on that platform, and more importantly, when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician, then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you. 
I was dating this guy, right? 
Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000. 
DH: Thank you very much! 
So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. 
It was like an ICU unit in the water. 
Ultimately, this is something we're investing in now for the future. 
He wants to solve ethics. 
I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks. 
It's remarkable: the position. 
We have fit over 5,000 amputees, and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is, does it improve lives? 
And he said, "Well, I've no idea. 
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed, right? 
But then we actually don't know that it's all out. 
MR: But what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death, so much as extending human youthspan. 
It was literally one of the best moments of my life. 
Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you're different from all the other beings? 
We intuit other people's feelings. 
This cell is looking for foreign objects, bacteria, things that it can find. 
It is ourselves we are healing. 
And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology, in our view of cancer. 
Because what can you do with that data? 
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time, but for me, as often as I'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis, I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light. 
And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave." 
Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount. 
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED, that the ideas that we think about look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century, and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse. 
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right? 
My father worked at this factory," he said. 
This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. 
But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls. 
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials. 
Models can come from the media, from our elected officials. 
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing. 
To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense to look where we've come from. 
I have some metronomes here. 
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful and more painful. 
And the plot really thickens when you realize that, unlike other pleistocene tools, the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. 
Eighty-five percent is a really big number. 
Importantly, those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body. 
Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies? 
Thank you. 
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street, several apartments and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings. 
But I didn't say these things to Abed. 
And the family was united. 
And I do think that the day that we might be able to repair the damaged brain is sooner than we think. 
There's a little carry-over baking. 
Now, flight -- what does it take to fly? 
And we stopped the ship, and it was just as the scientists had predicted. 
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. 
That's right. 
Now, how simple can you make the production? 
Could it be -- a devastating question, a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte -- could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete? 
And if you want, you can lay color in the mold, and get rid of the paint shop. 
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia. 
And because of that announcement, we got a big article in The New York Times, which led to more press, which led to more attention, and me deciding to become CEO of that company -- whereas I was just an adviser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring. 
CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah! 
We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. 
And thereby hangs a tale." 
Well, here are the numbers from 2010: .26 percent of America gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate, .05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate, .01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent -- gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates, and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic is .000042 percent — for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans — gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending. 
These great ice islands break off -- and now watch this. 
So I'm holding it, and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder, and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out. 
I step on the brake. 
We stand in elections; we vote in elections; we observe elections. 
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. 
It was mostly law enforcement and criminal. 
I mean, people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. 
Look at the faces of people whom you meet. 
We have to make this available for people." 
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies. 
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search, and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist. 
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. 
And actually, it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments. 
And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund. 
So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças. 
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular. 
I know when I'm licked." 
(Laughter) And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. 
On the next table was a Chinese guy, and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos. 
A: What's the next one you want to talk about? 
It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before. 
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down. 
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices -- I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks. 
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it. 
So very small, but very useful. 
Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along, Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again. 
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought, "How could we have predicted that?" 
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as they are taught the values of their society. 
Mummies are a great source of information, except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well. 
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on. 
So these are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order, and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves. 
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. 
Let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation. 
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop, where instead of bringing in food, we provide digital food, a card. 
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology, but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas. 
And then I thought, myself, how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology? 
And we are so close. 
I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies. 
In this context I'll just show you a few. 
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. 
It's a smiling face. 
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix. 
But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable, but let's just think about this. 
Even more remarkably though, the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep, profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old. 
In fact, if you look back, human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time. 
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers, he would charge up to people who were violating international law, and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter. 
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter) Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting. 
But we know that it's just not new. 
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed. 
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe. 
TK: Okay, this was my goal. 
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction. 
The one goal, the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close. 
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other. 
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair? 
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move. 
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. 
They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed. 
First, of course, the economic meltdown. 
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second, played back at 15 frames per second. 
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82, he said to himself and to everybody else, I will never use the word "unacceptable" again. 
But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy. 
So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. 
And you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about Shinerama. 
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring. 
Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times. 
And there, in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump. 
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight. 
And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place? 
The forest was sparkling. 
First of all, I could have started anywhere. 
I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge. 
On the left is the heart rate showing biology. 
So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important. 
My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- they're a civil society group — obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. 
We have communities who already have been dislocated. 
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction. 
Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx. 
They're quite vital places, these communities. 
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected. 
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. 
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations. 
And we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years, at least. 
(Laughter) When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal, and everything else, were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. 
(Laughter) It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me, if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. 
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D. 
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo, which is augmented by touch, or dresses that blushed and shivered with light. 
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door. 
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic, we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. 
I found that longer steps were much more elegant. 
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. 
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. 
And they supported me a bit, and I built this. 
Instead of blank stares and awkwardness, now it is pointing and smiling! 
I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying, until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. 
And the title of my talk was therefore "Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering." 
So what is it, three-dimensionally? 
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09. 
And I said, "We're going to come together at the end, we're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs, we're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health." 
Well, we chose to do this one not because it's easy, but because it can have amazing impact. 
Now you think to yourself -- because I know how you are -- you say, "That sure is terrible for those poor people. 
Now, I cannot imagine -- I'm sorry, you may have a better imagination than I do -- I can't imagine losing my arm, and typically at 22 years old. 
And I'm making a real plea here. 
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars, and when the guy comes ... " You see it. I was conned. 
And he published that book in the early 1930s, and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook. 
Or, you take this particular un-retouched photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, "Is there any perceptual difference between males and females?" 
OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. 
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world. 
Well, here is the image. 
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you. 
They're choreographing themselves. 
Some of them are very cute. (Text: clenched it) (Laughter) Some of them are funnier. 
Because we are all dependent on these water sources. 
He retreated into silence. 
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide, that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954. 
Why? 
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here. 
This was a very exciting time, developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. 
Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. 
And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen. 
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters. 
And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because I do know something about that -- he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive, which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. 
Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย. 
There's definitely hunger in America: 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children. 
Thank you. 
So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement. 
Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back. 
We have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea." 
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. 
You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell, and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together, play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive. 
It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies. 
The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. 
It would help to have a manual. 
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins, for example, or maybe an entire bone. 
What we do is important. It deserves our care, but it also deserves our revision. 
Would you believe, 12 pages, single space, the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy? 
So a country like America has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the American people. 
A number of years ago, Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available. 
It's a terrific studio assistant. 
But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. 
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way. 
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation, so if you just replace all these words of birth, I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option. 
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea. 
(Whistling) (Laughter) Sorry. I forgot one thing. 
And they're always wrong, always hilariously, optimistically wrong. 
In fact, in chemical accidents, hydrogen sulfide is known to -- if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground, you appear dead, but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm, if they do that quickly. 
We have this road going around the area, which brings the people electricity and water from our own area. 
So the queen goes down in there. 
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response, which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. 
You know, everything says, here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S., here it goes -- straight line. 
You all know this story. 
Then you get to their political articles. 
It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. 
(Soft crackling) And this is the space probe Cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn. 
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. 
(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A, it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children. 
So the light bulb is what wired the world. 
Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. 
Here's one of them. 
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa. 
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?" 
And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books. 
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones, the country collapsed. 
(Rattling) A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together. 
Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C? 
Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long used to darken the sun. 
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. 
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out. 
It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine. 
I would pull down the eyelids. 
He merely connected one sentence after another. 
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly? 
Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. 
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey. 
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence. 
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. 
And he wrote the Tierra system, and, in my book, is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems -- except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity. 
It smelled awful. 
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing. 
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively. 
He loved to win. 
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them. 
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually. 
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves. 
We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition. 
They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. 
Hands it over, and then gets some food. 
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside, and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang, which is actually incredibly uniform. 
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus. 
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside. 
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care, the hire of toys, farm work, hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door, services for tourists, home care. 
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual. 
Our world leaders, our global politics, currently can't get it done. 
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid, even though the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes." 
We kept traveling. 
So we resynthesized this song. 
And all of that's great, and it's fine. 
OK, there's two things I like about this. 
But today, as Indian companies go abroad, as Indians come and work all over the world, Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in. 
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this, we're just doing it. (Laughter) And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start, and most importantly of all, we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say, "These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems," because I have seen the power of small actions, and it is awesome. 
It's out in the middle of the Pacific, right around the Equator. 
In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody who has active T.B. who is infecting other people. 
No, we learned something else. 
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up. 
And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out. 
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy, not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. 
Anyway, this is the way the numbers unfolded. 
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment. 
Lightweight. Portable. 
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time. 
It was magic healers and aromatic oils. 
The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface, to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon, as we show up for the question of how do we change -- it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation, and it will continue to do that, on into the future. 
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward. 
I don't know. 
The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing. 
But I won't, because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year, and I know that my time is brief. 
And the food banks are growing. 
That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first, and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain. 
Nowadays, high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. 
In order to talk about cancer, I'm going to actually have to -- let me get the big slide here. 
"What are you carrying?" 
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. 
Now, obviously it wasn't fatal, but unfortunately, some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal. 
But today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. 
That's not true. 
And I saw, "Aha, that's the kidney and the soleus muscle." 
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning, I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. 
We set out on crutches. 
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us, when put in certain contexts, will actually make very specific mistakes. 
And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this, we're really creating a moment. 
It comes back at times of great transformation, globalization being one of those transformations. 
(Applause) So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm? 
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it. 
Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma. 
OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property, and it dates back to 1870. 
Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms. 
With four, you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kind of polygons. 
We've evolved to live in a world like this, but instead, we're living more and more of our lives like this -- this is the text message from my daughter last night -- in a world that's devoid of emotion. 
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this. 
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid, you don't get the economic recovery, which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers. 
We cherish the opportunity to have our say, to help decide the future of the country. 
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran, where Ahmadinejad remains in power. 
A generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen. 
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested. 
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say, "I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays. 
The idea behind her work was that at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life. 
I'm going to do just a short version of it. 
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages. 
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath. 
I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. 
There's all kinds of psychological challenges: how to keep a team together in these circumstances; how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you're living in these circumstances; sleep problems that arise; etc. 
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. 
It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things. 
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork. 
It's not easy, because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. 
That will blow away a lot of the opposition. 
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one. 
(Laughter) Mm-hm. (Laughter) So with all of this diversity in structure, one might think, then, that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. 
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of. 
This third best one was free trade. 
Now I said back in our little thought experiment, you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa. 
So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. 
(Applause) So raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness. 
But a couple of days later, we thought about it with my students, and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition? 
He said, "My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong." 
The green revolution never reached Africa. 
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour." 
We need culture out there." 
And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus, he carries 300 people -- 275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter) Speaking about the design: every city has its own design. 
Or you can have your last day at work. 
Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here. 
So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind. 
And these decisions affect Africa. 
Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong. 
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. 
This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms. 
(Laughter) Let me tell you my story. 
As you can see with your own eyes. 
As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years have been quite an exciting ride. 
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step, and therefore to drive it to move further. 
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled. 
Or something like this can become a piece like this. 
You have the crude oil. 
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us. 
That should make them more humble, more vulnerable and more human. 
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks -- we know that the stick is going up exponentially. 
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles, you cannot be celebrating that. 
It's going to be amazing. 
So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery. 
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness, by accelerating in a centrifuge. 
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe. 
The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. 
(Applause) The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. 
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S. 
Second, for the first time, and I think this is incredibly important, we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they're released. 
There also is a set of rules. 
Even in the 1930s, my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art. 
All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me? 
What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group -- was the same. 
Computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior, in terms of doing analytic thinking, remembering billions of facts accurately. 
By the way, I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good. 
I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut. 
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else. 
Maybe July, maybe June. 
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people -- this was at a time when the swine flu was going around -- we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands. 
It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static. 
And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay, trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206. 
Again, all of this is done in the way us humans do things, and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. 
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it. 
As the mushrooms grow, I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms. 
So the question becomes, What drives men's support for women's rights? 
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals. 
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go. 
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter) And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. 
So to the Tunisian intelligence agency, and organizations like it all over the Arab world, jihad equaled extremism, Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized. 
She has twice the wingspan that I do. 
And we, therefore, have a problem, because they escape traditional diplomacy. 
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. 
This is a big fibroid. 
You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way. 
I will show it to you. 
But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think. 
I'm a performer. 
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school. 
The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations. 
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day. 
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way. 
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God, didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. 
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. 
Now, if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart, and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are -- found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces. 
Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it? 
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?" 
Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not. 
I'm very, very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time: they're parked, they're parked all around us. 
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced. 
And I said, "I'm learning." 
There are also real business benefits. 
RSW: This is the computer building? 
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to" and the name of my son, "Jamie." 
So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
My father aspired to have a car like that, but my father had a beaten-up Mini, and he never, being a Jamaican coming to this country, he never had a driving license, he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT. 
This is what really excites us. 
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. 
I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. 
You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help. 
During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job. 
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves from some bacteria. 
Opportunities are unequally distributed. 
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. 
Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. 
Well, that's exciting. 
There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh, there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes, there's a Christian, there's a Sabian, there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council, what's wrong with the people that we chose?" 
One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. 
And boy, did that make it easy for the money launderers. 
In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have the highest concentration of Priuses, but you also have the perfect range extender. 
We do not believe in violence. 
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. 
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing. 
But that doesn't mean that we can relax. 
Processor performance on Intel chips, the average price of a transistor -- 1968, you could buy one transistor for a dollar. 
Thing is, it's owned by the city. 
(Laughter) But what they do have is incredible social skills. 
But there used to be a whole load of people. 
And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. 
And I think it's a pretty valid question. 
And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. 
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample. 
No matter how good you are, right, you still gotta deal with — So you hit this wall, and when I hit it, the first thing you do is you fall forward, and I'm like, all right, all right. 
Without it, we would have no music. 
They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. 
Infants don't respond to much. 
Through my work, I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. 
It chose Somali piracy. 
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say. 
We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen, capable of experiencing so many of these things. 
That's when I started writing songs, and even then I only played them for myself. 
Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around. 
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. 
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement? 
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. 
And they said, "Well no, but it has holes in its frill." 
But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration. 
It's much easier to use, much less painful. 
We use the notion of color. 
TD: So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. 
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em. 
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves. 
You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display. 
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest. 
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. 
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests, to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing, in that way, the loss of habitat and all those victims. 
You know why? Because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant. 
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave. 
Because old and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated and it's very simple, both at the same time. 
This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade. 
So I hope this will help us make better priorities, and think about how we better work for the world. 
And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it. 
You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it, but I have to work within that domain, to ensure that it gets you there first. 
(Applause) My journey to coming here today started in 1974. 
(Laughter) I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction -- to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea. 
A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up. 
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin -- able to replicate parts of the body. 
All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says, "Stop." 
And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff. 
We've set 2020 as our target year for zero, for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability. 
She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command. 
You know the incident. 
You know, we've heard that this week -- this romantic notion of the lone genius with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world is misleading. 
See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one. 
(Laughter) When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock, but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. 
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of what we did, a lot of the secret of our success, was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement. 
But in the end, amazingly, again, people were able to do it. 
And our "against" proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. 
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body, basically. 
I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things, which sent me insane. 
That takes time. 
We need to figure that out pretty fast. 
So, two examples. 
There's nothing benign about it. 
And so we're procedurally generating the texture map, and this is something a texture artist would take many, many days to work on. 
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. 
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth. 
Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. 
Without that, you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. 
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. 
It would be so light. 
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems, of open platforms, and embedded technology, I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time. 
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word for "happiness," and they believe that bats bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity. 
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone. 
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. 
We could go up into the millions of polygons. 
And Gabby, what's on the agenda now? 
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow." 
How do you think of where cosmology is now, in a sort of historical side? 
There are errors in translation, interpretative biases, and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes, you're going to have errors in recognition, errors in extraction, so you have very, very uncertain data. 
So they're really small, generally, they're square and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. 
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation: The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas. 
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer. 
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress. 
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. 
The highest concentrations are in red. 
It's only half the length of this one. 
Now, what about the future? 
The creator doesn't have any rights. 
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack. 
With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. 
I wanted a better education. 
Remi knows what love is. 
And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding, aging and weight gain software to see how he would look. 
And it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you. 
Then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this -- and then you're harvesting the seed garden. 
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who, back in March, demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video. 
If any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents, they were scolded. 
(Cheering) But first, I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. 
The project came back to us about a decade later, and this time with a director named David Fincher. 
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore." 
When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever, the mentors calm us down. 
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards, a deck of cards is made up of four different suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades. 
You hear about it on your television sets. 
Over the last year, we've been visiting sites in Africa, looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers. 
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. 
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas. 
Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two. 
And I built the first building, and guess what happened? 
They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will. 
Here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him. 
I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now. 
So what do you do with a dead mall, dead office park? 
What happens is that circular logic takes over. 
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long. 
Not a caress, but a wave of pain. 
Most towns at least have a 3G connection. 
So, what I do is honeybee research. 
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing. 
That means that out of five married couples, two will end up splitting their assets. 
There are balancers -- the U.S., Europe, China, Japan can balance each other. 
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003. 
Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow. 
(Laughter) So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight? 
It was as though time had stopped. 
It's more with less and less again. 
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company what information they store about you. 
(Laughter) That's enough! 
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. 
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. 
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization. 
(Laughter) My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer, and then as a worried member of the human race. 
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible. 
So here we have it. We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded. 
And some governments told me that it's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things. 
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. 
Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away. 
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference, you could buy me a Chagall. 
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs. 
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away from the surface, at high rates, as they run up the wall. 
The pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment. 
Now, right now, there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in, because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of 20,000 Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. 
And one of the things that you realize is it's an unusual environment. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. 
So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. 
And the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" -- this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy -- "if you can complete a one kilometer open water race." 
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 
Huge effect here of Starbucks. 
They said we couldn't do Iraq. 
This was in the late '80s. 
This is the same way we've been producing electricity, the steam turbine idea, for 100 years, and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water, but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. 
And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. 
RNG: Can hard-headed scientists really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy? 
And if you win a poetry slam, you can call yourself a slam champion and pretend you're a wrestler, and if you lose a poetry slam you can say, "Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form, you can't put numbers on such things." 
It's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation. 
So the mothers who work for us, they come from the communities in which they work. 
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. 
And they live for work, achievement and control. 
And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics. 
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot about its demographics, how things like income and education, gender and marriage relate to it. 
But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. 
They also preserve artifacts for posterity. 
And there's a little incendiary device inside of it, so that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it. 
They do a very good job because their children are eating their food, but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect, and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. 
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. 
Thank you. 
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is. 
They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. 
Now what I really wanted to do is to present this, basically as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is. 
So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. 
And I started to bring some order into some flags. 
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. 
Are you ready? You look a little nervous. 
Now if you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks. 
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it. 
And as the father was administering these instructions, a car drove by, slowly, and just after it passed the father and the teenagers, a hand went out from the front passenger window, and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father. 
Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place. 
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks -- Facebook as well. 
This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane. 
The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. 
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. 
So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute." 
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions, using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium. 
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? 
A thin film will creep up the inside wall, flow over the top and right out the outside. 
And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet, he'll still feel his missing hand. 
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it. 
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. 
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up: it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city and of the Jerusalem hills. 
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process. 
And when they came, they looted everything. 
I'd prefer to quote someone else, who testified with me before Congress, and in his position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft. 
You know way more than any of us. 
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin, a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it, but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue, so that primarily sour taste receptors, so normally things that would taste very sour or tart, somehow begin to taste very sweet. 
And we keep doing that, and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles. 
(Laughter) And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room. 
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet. 
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story. 
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself, the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there. 
Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life. 
I can feel your noise. 
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. 
I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support. 
Thank you very much. 
But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time. 
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts I often design them. 
Nature has learned to compensate with that, and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds. 
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot. 
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be. 
So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people, money, power, religion, culture, technology interact to change the map of the world. 
And the answer to it, I think, can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, where there's a tribe, a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians. 
And early in the morning, I went into the ward. 
And there were actually two of these. 
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away. 
These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. 
I was born unable to see most colors. 
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody. 
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers, allows us to actually simulate, in this piece, over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64. 
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. 
We must foster innovation, as I've said. 
And the organization draws together people of different generations, like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate, who's pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has, and on the right, Ada Wan, who has worked directly for the poor, but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give. 
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines. 
Now we do the same with airplanes. 
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. 
Now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter) Just with blobs of chemicals, again. 
And what you can then also begin to do is to say, "How are these genetic differences distributed across the world?" 
You should be immune. 
And this is 22 feet long. 
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. 
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. 
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also, and I think that it's recognizable there, and has an important effect on culture, because their public spaces are protected, their sidewalks are protected, and you're actually able to confront these things physically, and I think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things. 
So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here, and it was, it set the stage for the campaign. 
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex. 
This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. 
Look, you all are very well traveled; this is TEDGlobal after all. 
Of course they would. 
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example, publishing their plans online and saying to the world, "Please, could you help us to actually make them work this time?" 
Let me give you an example. 
If you have something to give, give it now. 
This is actually bad: human experiments. 
And we knew, once that worked, that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those. 
How do we really change children's relationship to food? 
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. 
So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? -- one basic instinct remains. 
That is that private equity has been sniffing around, and that tells me that this market is about to explode. 
So enter a group of out dykes, young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia, from Serbia to Slovenia. 
I also want to say that it is important for us to note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid, and all other forms of aid. 
We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics. 
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What? 
All they wanted to do was ask questions. 
So some people think that these models sound well and good, but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?" 
And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department, is to eat, and I did that very well, and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. 
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. 
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. 
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are. 
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day. 
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse. 
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general? 
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. 
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me, and that I was going to have to change. 
I'm going to try to condense this for you. 
And with that, we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen. 
So here is another obvious thing that we would do, typically, if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust, is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. 
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant. 
In this case misery truly does love company. 
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!" 
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions. 
Now, she had no idea what to look for. 
And there was a huge row online about, "Hey, this can't be real." 
And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries. 
She sang beautifully, and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese: 送你葱 So it's not like "hello" or "thank you," that ordinary stuff. 
Now, it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values, because science deals with facts, and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. 
So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office, and it’s about 400. 
If we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive. 
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain, and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case. 
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. 
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound. 
God is going to fix all the problems in the world. 
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy with, what, 100 billion stars like our Sun in it. 
And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting. 
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects, they become orphans of the narrative. 
In the early 19th century, church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked. 
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status, and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities. 
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood. 
But the money ran out. 
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None were started by one person. 
I didn't know the protocols. 
(Applause) Text is unbelievably private. 
A lot of models come from science. 
So this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at Columbia University, where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works. 
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. 
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. 
But the number of arts participants, people who write poetry, who sing songs, who perform in church choirs, is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. 
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas, we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. 
And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project. 
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy. 
And we'd rather read it during breakfast, because later we listen to radio in a car, check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV. 
Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know, but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility. 
"Where are you from?" 
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services. 
And I am convinced. 
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. 
Thanks. 
I knew that there was another part of the United Nations -- the UN Convention on Climate Change -- that was dealing with the issue of climate change. 
I would say here is where religious leaders come in, because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people, at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. 
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. 
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. 
What should it be for? 
The films were curated and contextualized. 
During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. 
This is the managing director of Gamma International. 
And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it, with lots left over. 
Now this is very unusual, because globally we find that, not surprisingly, people feel better as their country gets richer. 
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit. 
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this. 
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. 
And this is how they see the world. 
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. 
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness, then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. 
Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. 
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government, because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today. 
They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of Arizona. 
So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this? 
(Laughter) And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. 
They really are selling their software around the world. 
You become the president of the United States. 
Typically in the past, the donors have been interested in the first couple of years, and then they got bored. 
And I said to my parents, "I've got to go. 
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life. 
And on land, this cannot work. 
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost. 
(Applause) Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients, but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately, it's never been tapped as an idea. 
Now for some people, that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism. 
Infection in India. 
And you see these recipes on the side? 
The red lines there are me, and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control. 
It's 130 octane fuel. 
The prime minister is 12 years old. 
He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering: that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science, the arts and human enterprise, yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy and have -- and self-hatreds. 
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. 
This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration. 
"How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?" 
You can start to see some familiar balloons here. 
That's my little son. 
But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic, magical powers that they can predict the future, that they can make contact with the deceased. 
It was in a grizzly bear preserve, although no one told me that before we went. 
I think even NASA can do that, and they proved that they can. (Laughter) The problem is, what happens if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit and then you find out, oh, yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. 
Because they understand: There are places for the market and places where the market should not exist, where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others. 
Out, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence. 
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland, because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators. 
Well as it says in my introduction, I've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data. 
But when I stepped back, I felt myself at the cold, hard center of a perfect storm. 
Some people get less dressed up. 
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. 
It sounds like an oxymoron. 
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now. 
Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire, thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. 
(Laughter) Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse." 
I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this. 
It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do. 
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. 
And all I can say about this is: Why are we fighting it? 
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country, representing itself on the field. 
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. 
And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives. 
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective. 
They created a ruler that bends, what we would call these days a tape measure -- a flexible rule, a rule that bends. 
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. 
As we speak, the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. 
They said, "Syria?" "Syria." 
And that's what I did a few years ago when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid, which is survival, success and transformation. 
The technology revolution is opening the world. 
They're worried, in other words, that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat -- Oxfam, Save the Children wouldn't get the money to build their hospitals and schools. 
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? 
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later. 
And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints. 
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated. 
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network, we fly and study them as well. 
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain, and to see the intricacy of what lies within. 
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page? 
So in wildlife rescue, as in life, we learn from each previous experience, and we learn from both our successes and our failures. 
It's actually a person's trachea, and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us. 
But, as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. 
As my team leader Wynne once said, it's like doing a tattoo on someone. 
Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet. 
To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going to have to air some dirty laundry. 
Magnetic data storage -- that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots, different engineers, different companies, same exponential process. 
We actually have a very interesting payload on there. 
You know, I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. 
(Laughter) I was seeing if you were listening. 
And this can be used by anyone. 
And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in? 
Most want to go to Britain because they know the language, and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there. 
So they all have his number. 
All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington, we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda, but nobody is calling about the people. 
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone. 
And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale. 
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on, and finish the goddamn race!" 
There are those individuals who don't talk at all. 
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation. 
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. 
There is no progression of affairs in human experience. 
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process. 
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search. 
We don't have to do it that way anymore. 
And you then say, "There's an opportunity for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean? 
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same. 
That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous. 
And that seems fine. 
Of course, it must be American cola. 
Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent, how to be a good spouse, or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. 
But this is what helped me see it. 
And it has implications for systemic risk. 
This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back. 
It's not. A is true here. 
As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas, I learned that you could create your own world. 
(Laughter) Which is, again, a sense that it's all new. 
Being serious is hard. 
And 90 percent of our catch were sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom. 
That would be a fun thing to do. 
Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street. 
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. 
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. 
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what's a virus? 
In the context of this broad range of digital relations, safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation. 
So using the app, as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument, you hear the sounds of instruments warming up, which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. 
You slam them together, and if we are right, some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. 
Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis, but it's been around. 
Look what we've ... 
Will I never get married or have children?" 
For example, the dative construction in English. 
So Pivot, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. 
Thank you very much. 
The mission didn't work. 
Thank you. 
Now, I'm a fairly slow learner, but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important -- making things more attractive, making them a bit easier to use, making them more marketable. 
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell. 
They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks. 
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers, and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. 
I used to teach my students that there are some things, you know, computers just aren't good at, like driving a car through traffic. 
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others. 
One-two-three-four, one-two-three, come on, y'all! 
There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer? 
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. 
(Laughter) And Jeff and I did become friends, and he's organized a team of people and we're going to build this center. 
What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things. 
You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually, yes, be responsible, but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. 
I want you to estimate the height of the building." 
President Obama and his team simply cannot do it alone. 
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama. 
JA: What, the movie business? 
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank, once said that, "It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education." 
And I've heard this story a number of times. 
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. 
So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems, a million star systems, looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. 
Last week, my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing: the death of a newborn. 
With no money to fund my studies, I scaled new heights. 
Keep your hands up if you did 10. 
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another, because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means tsap sui, which, if you translate back, means "odds and ends." 
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. 
They just knew like, hey, they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers. But it's going to be big. 
Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward." 
These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. 
For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. 
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. 
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer. 
And as he came the second day, I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover." 
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens. 
What is it about Superman? 
If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them, they repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds, which is not -- is really quick. 
Do you want to come over and listen?" 
We have to invest in transformations capability, moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis, and of course to adapt to unavoidable change. 
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation -- that's what all of us are searching for. 
It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. 
And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear, with a predatory gaze. 
Now, when we tried to challenge this, going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down, we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners including this right-wing Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman, who said he would join our brief only if the word "no brainer" was in the brief somewhere. 
We had to change our culture about information. 
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this. 
And because we must all work to finish this story. 
See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo. 
That was an interesting case. 
This is actually in a riparian area. 
I'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence, from weakest to strongest. 
I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina. 
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons. 
But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. 
And as you breathe, think about what is in your breath. 
And that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved. 
Let's make sure, for democracies at least, killer robots remain fiction. 
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting. 
And when you think about the bed net, it's sort of a surgical intervention. 
From the Taliban's point of view, that was their number one mistake last time. 
So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust, if you reach into your body and grab your genome, if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record, you can actually go through an online informed consent process -- because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research, and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have 
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. 
(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31. 
The good thing is that we are not powerless. 
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse. 
One of them got caught up in the water. 
We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years, of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work. 
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world. 
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. 
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city, up to eight stories high, the tallest of them. 
And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy. 
That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about. 
What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live? 
Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us -- the animals, the plants, the insects -- love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss. 
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan. 
In effect, the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell. 
It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. 
♫ All of these words keep pouring out like rain ♫ ♫ I need a mad scientist to check my brain ♫ (Applause) I guarantee you that will never happen again. 
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic, but we are oblivious to the fact. 
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked, let alone look for a reason to it. 
We are in a remarkable moment here. 
So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live. 
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer, and sure enough, there's the white lilo, there are the two trees, there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo. 
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute, and we think about chips today, we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. 
Yeah. Three is a magic number. 
PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about. 
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio, not once, but twice, because they got reinfected. 
♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫ ♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫ ♫ See in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ Stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ Billie, time, ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ Still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says, ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫ (Applause) I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world. 
His parents are too busy to listen to his problems, and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. 
You buy them cheaply, you use them, you crumple them up, and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. 
We went and looked at a site. 
But where we are today, things have changed. 
We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world. 
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies, and the occasions when it works they will publish, and the ones where it doesn't work they won't. 
Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far. 
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long. 
And I still feel I'm running, it's just the training to become a long-distance papercutter. 
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it makes you glad they're driving less. 
So even though when the powder was poison, the friend drank the coffee and died, people say Grace deserves less blame in that case, when she innocently thought it was sugar, than in the other case, where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred. 
For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered. 
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. 
AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency, and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics. 
How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee? 
(Laughter) And juggling -- the balls cross and all that. 
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing. 
I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact, as we walked hand in hand, and pondering these very same questions. 
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. 
Now if you have a problem in the community, meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem, and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community. 
Right now, if we look at web queries, more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time. 
They have here Qatar. 
We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors, and finally integrated circuits. 
Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope, the smaller the detail that we can see. 
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. 
So this is a typical menu. 
We attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty. 
Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion? 
And eventually, you saturate the population. 
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, but this is a net situation. 
I thought there were them and there were us, and I was not one of them. 
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable, within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable. 
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. 
So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research, and at the same time when I was in the -- I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article about something called "purine derivatives." 
LM: Most of my professors were all for it, and they said, "Bring pictures and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you." 
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine, so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself. 
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. 
Thank you very much. 
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways. 
So the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites. 
We almost don't feel ourselves. 
And while it's growing, all these literal transformations are taking place. 
And somehow that seems wrong. 
(Laughter) It's definitely happy. 
(Laughter) It's not great for parents with kids. 
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. 
So the million-dollar question, is there anything different between these two happenings here? 
We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends. 
Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black? 
But it's going to have a big impact because we're going to have niche drugs. 
But also I was strong, holding myself up. 
This is a stream. 
Tremendous and beautiful discovery. 
That number probably needs to double. 
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss. 
This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories, and vastly different experiences, that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self, of personhood. 
The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity. 
And the expedition started in February last year. 
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know." 
So as you walk around a church, or a mosque or a cathedral, what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is, through your eyes, through your senses, truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. 
And the geese love the Lupin bush. 
But before we go through that process of divergence, there is actually quite an important first step. 
You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation. 
(Laughter). 
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 -- I'm surprised it was a quarter -- 90 percent thought that this last election was honest. 
Well, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did. 
But the way that our institutions are designed, in our rather 18th-century, centralized model, is to channel the flow of values through voting, once every four years, once every two years, at best, once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this era of social media, for us to actually express our values. 
And through Zoobiquity conferences, where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients. 
(Applause) The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone. 
And that's what you see here. 
And I put together an expedition. 
The reality is that even in democratic societies today, we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks. 
Now, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world, and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. 
Take the magic carpet for a ride. 
What about the visual context? 
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen. 
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new." 
And you have to remember it. 
You have to make it yourself. 
So, you know, sustainability, small planet. 
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive. 
In October of 1903, the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly. 
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle. 
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US. 
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck, we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters for the objects that people like. 
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything, all the rules gone. 
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. 
Education enlighten your brain, give you so many chances, and you're able to survive. 
A measure of music as a dollar. 
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert. 
Well, they were out, but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers. 
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy." 
She's in a very supportive environment. 
So we have to manage many claims to the same video. 
You can see, it's pretty much perfect. 
The 50 percent that goes in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank. 
The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de-extinction, but they'd never met each other. 
And you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions. 
I've found love. I'm happy." 
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. 
And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain. 
Now, fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry. 
(Laughter) That's the second of the quadruple. 
And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam. 
Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on. 
So what you see here is this is the design of the task. 
What you die of is increasing organ failure, with your respiratory, cardiac, renal, whatever organs packing up. Each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital, at the end of which, or at some point during which, somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop. 
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said, "Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of flat, thick safe ice." 
And this leads to oddities. 
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions -- you have to drive into the desert, you will see landscapes in many cases -- you can see from what we've discovered -- that nobody else has ever seen. 
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years. 
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl, and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness. 
It's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera. 
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house. 
How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. 
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different." 
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature, trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field. 
The imperative is not to figure out how to compute, but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition on data at this scale? 
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. 
I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West -- no, not the soft option that we have discussed before, but rather the soft power that Joseph Nye has spoken about before. 
You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two. 
There is bound to be a certain loss of identity, and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate. 
It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have, but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. 
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them. 
But one thing is clear. 
And these were traditions of the Middle East -- medieval traditions. 
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex. 
Four years after that, I received papers to move from Mountain Home, Idaho to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador. 
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay, and it was the imperfections that people cherished. 
She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried. 
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years. 
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised. 
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment. 
So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers, in Israel and abroad, really give nature a chance. 
These become forthright in places we need to protect. 
So what the world needs now, in my opinion, is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count. 
It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right? 
So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera. 
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am. 
Yeah? OK. 
We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem -- we can undo and unfriend and unfollow. 
After 9/11, either you were with us or against us. 
And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden. 
You see the mother in between and two daughters, probably on the left and right, and a single egg on the right-hand side. 
It's tricky. 
This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second, 20 miles per second. 
(Laughter) So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work? 
Because the problem is with use. 
That is very, very important. 
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats, and they like them. 
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun. 
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what? 
Got it? 
In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. 
So, in fact at this point there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild. 
And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. 
And the reference to the iPod as iconic, and in a way evocative of performance, delivery -- quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007, the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle, which rivals the iPod as an iconic product. 
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. 
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans, not just to a particular flavor of soda, but to a particular brand. 
"Cat." 
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991, and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. 
And what is happening today is, in one sense, frightening because it's never happened before. 
Try it! 
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value. 
Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces. 
And how I constructed it, is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead. 
Well, it's mostly true. 
So they kill the lions. 
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. 
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries. 
Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places. 
And the story of how all that happens is in this book. 
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her, but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom. 
Now, the system may gradually -- under pressure of climate change, erosion, biodiversity loss -- lose the depth of the cup, the resilience, but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly, under a threshold, be tipping over. Upff. 
I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues, a lot of legislators about these issues. 
That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. 
This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. 
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. 
When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, "Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? 
There was no format. 
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language. 
If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. 
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it? 
Well, then you could do an organ. 
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute; they just stuck there forever. 
And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. 
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia and [Pierre] Fatou. 
KA: Shocking. 
That's the biggest design challenge. 
What got you in that strange business?" 
We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. 
We've got the solar photovoltaic system, solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets, bamboo floors. 
But now for the good news! 
(Laughter) I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs. 
Here are some things, the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind: "A data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers." 
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized. 
Especially now, as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation, uninformed by social conscience; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters, and especially characters of the young people, who all too often, are subjected to bombardment of sensation, rather than digested experience. 
Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of ob/gyn's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis? 
So this is a game called Síochán Leat. It's "peace be with you." 
(Laughter) Where's my jet pack, Chris? 
Now this sounds a little theoretical, but it's not so theoretical. 
(Applause) These were just some of the things I've made. 
The second reason is that these governments, just like all the rest of us, are cultural psychopaths. 
Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans, each individual frame, it's got a very powerful feeling to it. 
Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere, which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. 
So they assumed this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron. 
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together, trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface -- and the movie starts playing in my head already. 
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured. 
You see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured. 
A lot of change. 
"Connected" is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. 
In other ways, it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet, you turn it up, and the next minute, your ears are blasted out by a louder passage. 
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty? 
Linear: take, make, waste. 
So chances are really, really good that your insula is going off right now, but I won't kid myself to think this means you love me. 
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this? 
(Music) Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us. 
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D. 
"He wants to burn Korans, our holy book. 
And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America. 
Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass. 
There's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis, because they're picking zero or one. 
(Video) Man: Okay. 
It's like this, like an amusement park. 
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere, and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. 
And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when. 
There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received. 
You've got people in white hats making food. 
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing. 
So, I decided over the years, because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture. 
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. 
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go, but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing. 
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much." 
This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it. 
All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. 
When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right? 
And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car, and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. 
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus. 
There is so many things to do; it's so fresh. 
Why did we use that word, science? 
NT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them from 20 different countries, including 20 women. 
NA: ShaketheDust.org. 
And I call it, "David and Goliath." 
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world. 
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick. 
Man: Get in the kitchen! Woman: No! Help! 
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent. 
And I thought, if I'm going to make a story, what's the last thing I'm going to put in there? 
I hugged him, of course, and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK." 
And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself. 
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point. 
And then if you have something you like, you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life, run the program in real life. 
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. 
So here are a couple of examples. 
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus. 
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. 
So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men, half of the time it's sudden cardiac death -- no opportunity to say good-bye, no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy, no opportunity to help her pick out a wig. 
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. 
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. 
And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip. 
So our sense was we had to do one thing, and only one thing, instead of trying to have everything. 
Some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet, shown here in white. 
We're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks. 
And that question cleared the space. 
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. 
And sometimes we even have to trust computers. 
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC. 
Our chimpanzee, first we found two of them in the state of New York. 
This is the ARES team; we have about 150 scientists, engineers; where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. 
Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees. 
Thank you. (Applause) I've always wanted to be a cyborg. 
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony. 
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people, they would be dots like this. 
Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores. 
(Applause) That's how we traveled in the year 1900. 
Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance. 
I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. 
Now, that is sufficiently zany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did. 
And we don't appear until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story, just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective. 
It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11, when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died. 
This is crap. 
Now these animals are different from one another, because they have different genes. 
Well, that's the end of my talk. 
And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes, which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do, is something that scientists don't actually, usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory, a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies, than actually 30 years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. 
You must get -- ? 
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything." 
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags, but they can also lose press freedom, as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. 
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. 
This is the environmental conditions on the planet. 
They don't have to do global devastation. 
(Applause) So let's start with some good news, and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases? 
So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. 
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on? 
That's what emergence means. 
It's a little quirky and silly. 
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream. 
I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. 
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step. 
And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar, it's not the harpy eagle, it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. 
Now, there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica. 
Human waste, in its rawest form, finds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water, irrigation water, whatever water you see. 
It is not God that I do not accept. 
The deeper you go, the loopier you get. 
Something I truly believe. 
Those two countries are geographically similar. 
If he's using landmark orientation, he should be able to find the burrow, because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it. 
I think that's the main point to be made. 
And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex. 
And I'm here to tell you, if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED, it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture. 
People who say, don't sit that team next to this team, because they like noise and they need quiet. 
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. 
And to the cosmologist, these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe. 
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid." 
And when tension increased, they already had that dialogue, and that was a strength to deal with different issues. 
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth, far beyond the Earth as depicted here. 
In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake. 
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human, the machine has passed the test. 
We weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants. 
It's one of the world's oldest inventions: a bar of soap. 
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars. 
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. 
(Laughter) I'm going to let you in on that secret. 
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this. 
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. 
Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria, it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. 
They reversed the flow of water. 
Here is just some data. This is China. 
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two, and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five. 
We have the tools. We have the knowhow, and we can take the lessons we've learned from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad, and apply those to local jihad. 
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century. 
You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. 
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war. 
(Applause) That tells you that education transforms people. 
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. 
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things. 
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal. 
Do a canned demo, or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is. 
And we were just crossing every finger, praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did. 
A human being should not have to face the void of death. 
I asked a question last year: Can art change the world? 
Thank you very much. 
A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light. 
So we worked with a design studio called Habits, in Milan, to make this mirror, which is completely open-source. 
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel, non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks. 
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. 
So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house, and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house, and opened the kitchen door. 
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, "Well I feel we should do this." 
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. 
I said, "Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today, and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken." 
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light, it just emits light at particular colors, a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones. 
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. 
This is slave labor to my own project. 
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. 
(Laughter) Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus. 
One-two-three-four, one-two-three. Yeah. 
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. 
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. 
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset. 
It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other. 
I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point -- it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors, which we need very much, here and in the world. 
This is now in the hands of the consortium. 
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri, who renews the ball of the sun every morning, which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. 
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India." 
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week. 
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?" 
We have made a lot of discoveries, we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin. 
We need a movie on those six categories. 
She said, "Come to my apartment." 
The horror needs to be put into words -- human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again. 
You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo. 
What would that tell us? 
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month. 
(Applause) Ah yes, those university days, a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics and world debating championships, or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah." 
It is the essence of human efforts: how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. 
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. 
Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone. 
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper, but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave, like a prehistoric scientist. 
He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old. 
So this building became a permanent building. 
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. 
This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms, shows a sign which I had translated when I got home. 
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem, because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon. 
(Applause) I'm an American, which means, generally, I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds. 
And this region, the regions within the limbic system, have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults, and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex, which you can see in blue in the slide here, which stops us taking excessive risks, is still very much in development in adolescents. 
But in fact, that question "Is it still ethical?" 
And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin was made from Brad, we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87. 
Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea -- human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. 
We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. 
They expanded what it means to be an American, including Japanese-Americans that were feared and suspected and hated. 
But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. 
But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species. 
If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains, and the larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be. 
Let's face it, we're all on a one-way street, aren't we, and what are we going to do? 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. 
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. 
For example, among the Greenland Norse -- a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land, forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run, but led to the society's collapse in the long run. 
Because these are important benefits for the poor. 
I think that's the wrong way to think about it. 
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long, flat tail. 
And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives, or their philanthropic work, or their other interests. 
(Applause) It's a continuum of traits. 
The West may collapse very suddenly. 
It takes eight seconds to do this, and now that that's done, we can choose a movement-based action. 
He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land. 
I think they'd make good allies. 
It's very, very unlikely. 
Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning, I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra. 
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies. 
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together. 
But now, in our third acts, it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time. 
And how do we make more legible in this growing world, especially in some of the places that I'm talking about -- China, for example, which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports. 
It happened while I was working as a research fellow at the U.S. Naval Academy. 
They have everything in their hands. 
We are now interlocked, as nations, as individuals, in a way which has never been the case before, never been the case before. 
And then another thing opens, you close that. 
Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat." 
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. 
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. 
A few were still there with bad grades. 
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people, and I'd spent about five weeks there, and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. 
Can you show us how good of a pilot you are? 
Thank you. 
Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it. 
I'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student -- I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. 
Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology. 
I said "play," all right. 
So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946, married my mom, and bought a house in Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775, although we didn't actually hit any of them until Concord. 
(Laughter) Gas, I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up. 
Teacher: Well done. Very good ... 
So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt. 
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there -- I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71. 
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point. 
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. 
And you think of him as nursing you. 
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over. 
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks, [unclear] and functions. 
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes. 
Keep to the track, to the beaten track; Memory holds all you need of the truth. 
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, "I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano." 
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters. 
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. 
Also for search and rescue applications as well. 
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. 
When we start by teaching young people that we live, not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, to change our institutions, that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation, towards this open government movement, towards this open government revolution. 
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth, but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material. 
And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth. 
Many of us carry this image of this all-knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. 
One example among many. 
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. 
Thank you very much. 
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. 
So my final plank is, tell your story. 
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. 
Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. 
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data, and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives. 
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it, or you can have them wide open. 
Governments aren't very good at telling stories. 
An aviation checklist, like this one for a single-engine plane, isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane, it's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they're not checked. 
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book. 
All this training -- I had transformed my life. 
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. 
If you see the word "microfinance," what comes to mind? 
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash. 
Wait for the go. I'll say go. 
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side. 
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen. 
But on the more global level, what can we do? 
Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over 1,000 years. 
And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right. 
The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. 
He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do. 
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H -- we never mistake it for an S-H, OK? 
Really powerful dynamic. 
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. 
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. 
You think people are talking about you. 
And guess what? 
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. 
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem. 
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from. 
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles, much to the dismay of my oncologist. 
Now, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea. 
and you also get hot water. 
They are doing tons of malaria research. 
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people." 
He would have the sound coming through the resonators. 
The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions, for example. 
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with? 
And then I thought, well this is fun. 
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael, on the computer, and Thomas who's helping me onstage. 
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that. 
I mean, there's not any traditional notation. 
Within a few months, there were two and a half million more girls in school. 
These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. 
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow. 
When the history books get written, I think our age will be remembered for three things. 
And that's the way you make your tritium. 
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness. 
It was simply awful for women. 
We want the best drugs, the best technologies, the best specialists, but we don't think too much about how it all comes together. 
Not only that you can, but that you will when they are properly suggested to you. 
The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine, you can start shooting at people. 
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me. 
What do we typically finance? 
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. 
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool, there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera. 
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down. 
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. 
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day? 
What is he thinking about that's making him blush? 
Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. 
We're trying to end mass incarceration." 
They give us that beautiful brown crust. 
That's great. 
His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician -- not an ill-educated man. 
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. 
Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. 
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse. 
I focus on balancing meaningful message, aesthetic, beauty, composition, some irony, and artifacts. 
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again, I just drag these guys out and set them going. 
But there's actually a lot of structure there. 
So this also turns out to be extremely robust. 
Thank you. 
And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream, an extreme dream, something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion, something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life, every minute of every day, because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction. 
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed. 
But robots are still not in our home, ironically. 
You know, I guess the first question is, why build a virtual world at all? 
But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology. 
So that if we want to create environments with good rules, we can't just tear down. 
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. 
Audience: Must. 
Continuous improvement. 
No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think. 
And it's very present in a crowd like you. 
So what would you do at this point? 
And I was there with my arms open. 
Now, who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network? 
It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on. 
The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. 
And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. 
It shouldn't be that difficult. 
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day. 
There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously. 
And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale, as they interface with broader problems, that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance. 
Well, I got an X-ray, and the next morning -- you may have noticed, those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this. 
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand. 
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey. 
And when we find these, we may find differences. 
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today? 
The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. 
(Laughter) Came back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour. 
I think that's the bigger change. 
Hannah Arendt said, "The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. 
It's called a lobotomy. 
He really was not intending to work in patent research, but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job. 
So are we all. 
I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of? 
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections, or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year. 
Will they outlive me? They probably might. 
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them. 
We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results. 
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history, not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. 
I turned to him at the end of the meal, and it's a question I asked several times, and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly, but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain, some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you. 
Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s? 
Is this what we want? 
It was an Orthodox Jewish community. 
And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq. 
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine, show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion. 
And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey, and other people like him, to try to do something about this as soon as possible. 
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa. 
So here's the modalities that we put together. 
Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology, they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women. 
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond. 
I've got the family, spent the better part of a day talking with them. 
(Laughter) And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction. 
And therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. 
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. 
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today. 
And you are correct. 
It was made using these three techniques: copy, transform and combine. 
And there I really worked as an apprentice. 
That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. 
It's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from 100 thousand cars is 2011, to 10 million cars by 2016 -- 100 x growth in less than five years. 
Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. 
She preferred the sequel. 
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words, so he just feels the horror over and over again. 
In America, the primary locus of choice is the individual. 
You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking, and in the way that you do, you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. 
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. 
(Applause) (Laughter) Right. As you can see, Bart Simpson is having a little argument. 
That's something on the order of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone. 
First question to answer for us: so what? 
Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health. 
What are the incredible weaknesses? 
The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. 
And the country that does this first will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an improved economy, an improved outlook. 
Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new, they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?" 
We then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice -- three months and six months -- and to our surprise, almost, the line's gone up. 
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical. 
As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. 
And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach. 
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string. 
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that." 
And he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the binary code straight off the machine. 
And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me, standing -- well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials. 
So it had its downsides. 
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion. 
Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star. 
Audience: Data. 
TS: As it turns out, this device kind of comes in handy, because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do, that I can operate slides, which is more of a mental process. 
(Laughter) I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time. 
(Applause) I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. 
In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself, but it performs services for the city at large. 
You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are, of course, very observable and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do. 
As an artist, I've been interested, in fact, in the visualization of citizenship, the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories, in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces. 
Six months later, the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice, and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it. 
And so I hope that maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. 
So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. 
But with that, we were going to gain freedom: freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective; freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no; and freedom to control a budget, to spend money where it matters, not how a district or a state says you have to do it. 
And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before. 
We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea, for a mere idea. No other species can do that. 
The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. 
He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said. 
A poor person, a low-income person, somebody in "Cancer Alley," somebody in Watts, somebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation, might say to themselves, and rightfully so, "How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life, or an aluminum can has a second chance, and yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison, he doesn't get a second chance?" 
The trucks could even use natural gas. 
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. 
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and it's called "Floating Memories." 
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown that BPA leaches from babies' bottles into the formula, into the milk, and therefore into the babies. 
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness, there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself. 
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice; we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back." 
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch. 
Nothing. Nothing. 
And, just like Project Tiger, our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. 
The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there. 
More specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. 
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. 
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible. 
We need more sticks, too. 
Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this, complex jazz improvisation, and study it rigorously. 
Let's talk about what's going on today. 
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best. 
Health just takes more time. 
They've enriched the lives of billions. 
In order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported. 
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water, and then working together, maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal. 
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. 
And I think often times people get lost in that. 
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total. 
Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard." 
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too. 
This is what it's about. 
And it finally happened, so ... 
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. 
So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ. 
And what the Veterans' Court did, was it treated each criminal as an individual, tried to get inside their problems, tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves, and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. 
Blackouts are not fun. 
So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool called Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded, and when we went through all those various cities, we found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day. 
What does the brand stand for in your head? 
Thank you very much. 
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics. 
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment. 
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks, every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice. 
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin. 
And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit, and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who's given up smoking for the month of Ramadan, she has to know something about a global audience. 
It evokes the container metaphor of communication, in which we conceive of ideas as objects, sentences as containers, and communication as a kind of sending. 
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan? 
I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy. 
How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention? 
The description read: "The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto." 
How did this happen? 
You're paying for the bling, that they're encrusted with gold and platinum. 
The DNA matched, and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. 
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the "representative foreigner." 
Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. 
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated, and he vents his frustrations. 
Four is blue. 
That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin, but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells. 
Whether this is a personal decision -- whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision -- where you're going to invade some foreign country -- you're going to trade off something, either money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties. 
We didn't have a framework. 
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities. 
The problem is these are arousal addictions. 
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. 
The phones just aren't ringing about the people." 
So think about your pitch as a timeline. 
This is "disappear." 
From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000. 
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us. 
I think it's time to upgrade the system. 
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very, very specific to its location, to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls. 
And it sounded like me, it really did. 
Now, before Manya's customer would go home and think things through, she would say to him, "The car that you are buying now is perfect, but in a few year's time, when your kids will be already out of the house, when you will have a little bit more money, that other car will be ideal. 
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses. 
And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time. 
If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way, cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost. 
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. 
Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years. 
What we really wanted was a full human body. 
Why has it accelerated lately? 
You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. 
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination, and that's what writing is. 
It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy. 
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort? 
(Laughter) And he could say, "Oh my God!" 
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us, and three generations later, I was part of a project called StoryCorps, which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces. 
I love that you put it out there. 
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio, "There's never a wrong time to do the right thing." 
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. 
And we're going to try to really pull this off, intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive. 
The question is, what can I do with you? 
That you can go from this zero situation, by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees in the lines in that grass there, putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost, and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. 
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. 
So the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age, and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist trying to understand, why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long? 
So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk? 
I remember vividly the week it all came together. 
It appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad? 
And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools open across England, and another 40 areas want to have their own schools opening -- a pretty rapid spread of this idea. 
And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. 
We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. 
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that. 
And it's shown here in its true orientation. 
Thanks. 
In any case, the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. 
We feel we're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the Studio School idea into something which is present, not as a universal answer for every child, but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world. 
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things, just something that's exquisitely beautiful, that's universally beautiful. 
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. 
And I believe the answer is yes. 
By the end of the investigation, where you can read the full 27-page report at that link, we had photos of the cybercriminals, even the office Christmas party when they were out on an outing. 
Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school to graduate school. 
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved. 
One of them once said: "In prison you never sleep. 
In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy. 
But this time, the migration leaves African-Americans in place, as families and businesses flee the city, leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. 
They were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. 
We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. 
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself. 
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on. 
The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks. 
Mike deGruy was also invited, and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean, and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time, which is the hunt for the giant squid. 
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. 
They get into the food chain. 
But there's so much more work to be done. 
They really want their world back. 
So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later, I left with a mission, a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. 
And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. 
Be serious, it says. 
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension. 
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah. 
You've got to be able to make them all the time. 
Dopamine, I think, changes our signal-to-noise ratio. 
Or to use the technical term for it, there's one born every minute. 
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking. 
Now, I think many have seen business as the problem, or at least one of the problems, in many of the social challenges we face. 
So, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim. 
It's a very difficult number to deal with, because what we've done is we've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads. 
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle. 
They are believed to have magical powers. 
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline. 
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is -- it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain, it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors, it breeds quickly, and it's cheap. 
He's called Bageye because he has permanent bags under his eyes. 
Would you mind taking the brain out, and I just want you to feel something. 
So, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way. 
Moral ambiguity takes off. 
♫ I ♫ ♫ I got ♫ ♫ I got kicked ♫ ♫ I got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pony. ♫ ♫ I got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫ ♫ where I swore to the guy ♫ ♫ that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. ♫ ♫ Me got ♫ ♫ Me got kicked ♫ ♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pony. ♫ ♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫ 
We're going to eradicate fear. 
And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here. 
(Laughter) I belong to an Internet discussion forum, an African Internet discussion forum, and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly 204 African heads of state, since 1960." 
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant. 
So when you look at a detail of this work, you can see, the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him. 
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent, a lot more willing to listen, a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower. 
But hey, we're on TED time. 
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement. 
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very, very big impact on my late father. 
But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh. 
DR: Well, it's a funny thing. 
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash. 
And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. 
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary. 
We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that. 
So what happens next? Where do we go from there? 
Now that statistic is quite shocking. 
They are in many important places against markets. 
I've always -- just as a listener, as just a fan -- I listen to that, and I'm just astounded. 
Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of Texas were on fire. 
But even here among us, most -- in the most advanced society in the world, we have poverty. 
It dies too fast. 
The slide you're looking at here is 1990 to 2040. 
If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time, executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set. 
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that. 
Anyway, there isn't. (Laughter) You don't need something more to explain something more. 
You get new tools for people in the developing world. 
And this is terribly important, because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C. 
Yeah, sure, I'm game for it. 
That is all aid can be. 
Today -- a billion squatters, one in six people on the planet. 
My people build all the time with clay, but they don't see any innovation with mud. 
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on, and currently define as the worth of your reputation, your intentions, capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces. 
Fortunately, people right now cannot be deceived. 
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench. 
And these red dots show the most congested parts, which are the bridges that lead into the inner city. 
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
(Applause) MK: Thank you everybody. GG: Bye bye. (Applause) If you are a blind child in India, you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news.

Still, in my opinion, we have two choices. 
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. 
And it came down to something called gout, which, as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body, and worse in the joints, which made the gharial unable to swim. 
There is more of it than you think, actually. 
What is that idea? 
When they get a hankering for some treats, we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market. 
It means things happen. 
For example, probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. 
You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up. 
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch, Ratan is taller than me, and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. 
And I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful." 
Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right? 
You're having to imagine it. 
Now she can run all of the activities of her farm. 
I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. 
It's never happened before. 
There are inherent benefits to this. 
General purpose technologies drive most economic growth, because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations, like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign. 
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email. 
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect. 
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile, that he has non-genetic ALS. 
But I began to ask questions and search out the usual things that I had been exploring before, like, what do the maps look like? 
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her. 
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. 
And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets, and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another, like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets, which we then let mature. 
Look what I found. (Laughter) Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth. 
Also rode on one. I ... 
Changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.

Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper? 
And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC, could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted. 
These are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, and they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets, and these bees are terrific, and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden. 
"Sit," sniff butt. 
(Laughter) Now that is surgical thinking. 
When you think about your own country, when you think about other people's countries, when you think about companies, when you talk about the world that we live in today, start using that word in the way that I've talked about this evening. 
They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA. 
(Applause) The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool? 
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state, what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic, I refused to take more medication. 
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002. 
Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. 
It's very tough. It's very tough. 
I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. 
Here's me singing "Sleep." 
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. 
The gold of today is mobile, and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible.

Dignity cannot wait for better times. 
Last lesson, from a Latin American: This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. 
These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder, and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world. 
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them: the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. 
It's a way of using the language between actual people. 
And they have beliefs about what other people want, and what other people don't want, how much power other people have, how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.

But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere, a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. 
It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. 
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent. 
The right answer, confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft, was that Venus was very hot -- 900 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The third stage has a camera. 
And this was at the beginning of elections. 
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas. 
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. 
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution. 
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. 
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep, hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil that have, as yet, no names. 
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. 
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see. 
It hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose. 
Or, at moments, they lied out of habit. 
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77. 
Now blink left to turn back left. 
So replicating food, taking it into that next level is where we're going. 
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself. 
And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast, because the coast, instead of being paradise, is harmful to your health." 
He's the dude on the left. 
And now the end: everyone was enjoying the journey very much. 
My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now. 
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year, and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled. 
Do you know where it's three per 100,000? 
And we managed to get that magic moment. 
They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles. 
It benefits over 400,000 people and it's still going on. 
But maybe they have another faculty, something else that would seem equally irrational to us, but they actually tap into some great possible value there. 
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there. 
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True." 
And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience: how are the brains of men and women different? 
We then place it in an oven-like device, and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. 
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child, but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment. 
My favorite, though, are all the warning labels. 
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff. 
Anyway he thought he'd better do it, because I never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him. 
You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface. 
(Laughter) Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that "discovery" and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying, "But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big." 
The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. 
And I want to demonstrate that that, too, is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. 
Add those up. That is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly. 
Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance. 
But it's a special kind of social norm, because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to. 
You've heard that the average American spends 90 percent of their time indoors. 
BG: Well it's hard to say. 
And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. 
And you've heard of serotonin, of course, in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. 
Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming. 
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens. 
Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive?

I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet, for your children, and their children, and all of humanity. 
And this seemed very interesting to me. 
So with modern technology, we used computers to make models. 
You can write papers about complexity, and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways, so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter) Simplicity -- all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does, but not explode or play Beethoven. 
It won't be solved by tweeting harder, building slicker apps, or starting one more artisanal coffee roasting service. 
How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone, but make those buildings energy efficient, and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane. 
(Laughter) This is called "59." 
And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. 
We're going to win because we have dreams. 
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. 
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy. 
And here's the rub. 
Experiments were all wrong. 
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self. 
But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants, because we usually do that in statistics. 
In short, we have no constraints. 
And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?" 
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees; our ancestors went out onto the plain. 
There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world, given how dangerous it's becoming.

The audience can talk back. 
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. 
And so we can control that with micro-controllers and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. 
And one of the things we were looking at is -- if you can't read and write, if you want to communicate over distances, you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with. 
I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well-conducted. 
Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.

Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com. 
Let's have our cars go at 60 miles per hour. 
So -- (Laughter) So, there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional, and you might suggest that was it. 
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. 
They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them. 
So, I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan. 
And very often violence is a way to cope with it. 
If we're going to change children's relationship to food, it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias, hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes -- and academic curriculum to tie it all together. 
It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. 
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.

When you see the microphone, say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide. 
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function, with other functions being preserved intact, and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function. 
Now, as if this was not enough -- to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet -- we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states, separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram, where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. 
But when you do read the links, it's really quite remarkable. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And you know people, this is the problem with quote, objectivity, unquote. 
And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve, and why did it evolve only in our species? 
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down? And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. 
They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves, and they also contain records of natural and human events. 
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up? 
She is now running for president. 
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. 
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds. 
She said, "Everything is fine, but once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him." 
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. 
So why not eat insects? 
you may argue, "Well, maybe Country A is China and Country B is India." 
And so what is symmetry? 
He told me to go in his room. 
That's pretty much it. 
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific would convert to crude oil, and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it, they still can't compete with two cents a mile. 
But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined. 
(Laughter) "Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first." 
Four, five years old, 20 minutes three times a week. 
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights. 
Birds are living dinosaurs. 
That was her resistance. 
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." 
If you take the last 10 years and bring forward, you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars. 
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens. 
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make. 
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world. 
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated. 
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. 
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery. 
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers. 
Two hundred million people a year. 
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence, perhaps even implants into our brains, may change human beings themselves. And human beings, their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years. 
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark, 0.2 miles away from a humpback. 
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count. 
You could see arguments on both sides. 
And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp. 
And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study. 
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK. 
And it is an absolutely virgin market. 
But this is not really mass customization; it's known as variant production, variations of the same product. 
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life, because I think there is a connection. 
(Laughter) Quick moment for the designers in the audience. 
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain. 
Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. 
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010. 
As I said, they were adventurous people. 
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up. 
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range, but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. 
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. 
But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. 
You want to see God. 
You take them for a walk. 
So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices. 
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe." 
You'll find your own way to discover, to learn, to teach. 
And what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it. 
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. 
Instead, I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue, which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. 
And that is this: the farm is called Polyface, which means ... 
Did this really happen? 
I know I don't need it. 
I like the physical book. 
(Laughter) Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam, you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend. 
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible. 
On this xeroxed piece of paper, the crash had not yet happened. 
Sorry, I hate to carry on... 
And it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org. 
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. 
If any of you come to my place, I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you. 
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys. 
And everybody can do something on this as an individual. 
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations. 
Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. 
But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. 
The other guy had to say, I'm going to build 50 new schools. 
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent. 
These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding, because they're threatened by them. 
If they continued their vigil, what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years? 
We also need the choices for people. 
But I warn you, it's addictive. 
So we were trying to think, how could we make a whole thing emanate. 
So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate, we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach. 
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. 
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched. 
There are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time," the word "future," the word "wish". 
This is a tree. 
In the end, it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. 
And I wanted to give up. 
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it, he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online, so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing, and, you know, gauge its freshness. 
Because in reality, what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound, and you have a scanner, basically like a flatbed scanner. 
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery. 
Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, healthcare, all these issues facing us. 
But in any event, by the end of this year, beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome. 
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done -- it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it -- is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. 
And you need to re-set it up. 
They can still hunt, but they can't be social. 
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later. 
(Laughter) "I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me." 
He wanted to test out the question of, where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks? 
This is on the way home. 
My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions, I live my life over, as though I were drowning. 
And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to. 
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak. 
And that's a lovely, evocative name. 
I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in 1650. 
When did the randoms -- when did the friends take off and leave the randoms, and [when did] their curve start shifting? 
I shivered -- (Laughter) -- contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room, and said "Girls, hold the front page. 
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating. 
I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. 
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in, over 60 percent. 
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline. 
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist. 
Miracle of cooperation: it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts. 
It's ephemeral just like us." 
(Laughter) The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against. 
I am, and have been since birth, legally blind. 
And my sense is, it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life. 
Computers! What about computers? 
And they said, oh, you don't need to do that. 
These are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory, which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying, and also the Serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions. 
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India. 
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school. 
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe you went to the moon, but you did. 
[Society] The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components. 
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it. 
And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. 
And in order to do that, you have to think, where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery? 
Two years later, she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer. 
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. 
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving, you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability. 
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce. 
After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity," I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine. 
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project. 
(Laughter) And you wouldn't believe it, but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. 
This is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied, but it's now void. 
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second. 
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic, there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords. 
Co-branding opportunities. 
So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. 
Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes. 
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill, and as he reported back to me, the response was, "Hell no! 
Now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research. 
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do. 
This is what we believe. 
So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells. 
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? 
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other. 
And I learned a key insight to character. 
And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite, incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe, and as other particles go through those particles and interact, that's where they get their mass. 
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation. 
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me. 
And after that initial prototype, we set out to make free and open-source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did. 
On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck, and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant. 
It's got concertina wire along the sides of it. 
We also have a second oxygen cylinder, that's solely as a back-up in case there's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe. 
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody, not just Julian Assange, have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on, scrutinizing, informing others, and even organizing collective responses. 
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning. 
But that day in the cotton field out there picking, when those people started singing, I realized I was in the very heart of real music, and that's where I've wanted to be ever since. 
We have urban planners. 
Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend. 
In essence, dancers were challenging each other online to get better; incredible new dance skills were being invented; even the six-year-olds were joining in. 
Thank you and God bless you. 
And there are people -- men, women, who suddenly no longer sleep. 
They had a big patient population. 
Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. 
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides. 
This is the town hall for the city. 
By 2010, college graduates, if you said two circles followed by a semicircle, two sixteens followed by what, they would say eight, because eight is half of 16. 
I want to shine a light on slavery. 
And I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man. 
So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. 
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks. 
What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. 
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border. 
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. 
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.) (Applause) How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine? 
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop, but they were very proud so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza. 
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise, to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us, but to just talk about it like what it is, not an existential crisis, not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views, but a math problem, a really solvable math problem, one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around. 
You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging. 
It's a little mechanical pen that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen. 
He gives half of them vitamin C. 
So, this was not something we actually put in there. 
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. 
It's not about decoration. 
That's all I'd ever known. 
Others have a few residents in them, one or two "babushkas," or "babas," which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. 
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating, because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago. 
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it, which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system, and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers. 
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels, who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks. 
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse." 
(Laughter) What a liberating thought! Yes! 
He sees something in the path. 
But we have to integrate that into our own future. 
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. 
You should have seen my parents' reaction! 
And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality. 
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said, "Look, your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money, we are grateful. 
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now, because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this, and my parents are sitting in the front row. 
And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. 
The films provided communality across all manner of divide. 
From Jeffrey Gutierrez: &amp;quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&amp;quot; So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, people don't care, people think it's a waste of time, and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family. 
And here's another example for one of these side effects. 
Well, they kept them alive. 
I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer, to my mind, than work. 
And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century, right? 
And I see it over and over and over again. 
I thought, it'll have to do. 
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that's hard. 
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective. 
And, as you can see, they don't use their first names. 
So the other thing I really like about this, besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease, is that often the kinds of interventions that you want, that it indicates should be done, are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow. 
And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work. 
When I spoke to the -- my project management team, they said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous. 
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system. 
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. 
So let me try and illustrate that. 
14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other. 
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. 
They're not very well designed, right? 
If the group doesn't take action, the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. 
In fact, urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. 
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. 
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..." 
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that. 
Most of the time it looked like this. 
It tries to affect people. 
It's all if. 
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story. 
And that fascinated me, because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life. 
I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. 
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. 
We stole the idea from bicycle seats, and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots. 
So the question is: Can anything else happen? 
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme, that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy, and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure. 
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design. 
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children. 
(Laughter) Additionally, I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms. 
At a personal level, we need these nudges too. 
That's something we should do in all the schools in the world. 
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth. 
Thank you all very much. 
I'll never forget, the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons. 
And our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century make them history. 
I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint. 
I work with a special method to do it, quick. 
One woman gives birth to a baby. 
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. 
Sorry. (Laughter) Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? 
What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea. 
You get disrupted connections. 
We can use, actually, biomaterials and the cells together. 
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. 
It certainly is not clever, and it's not original. 
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes, and two, it does not look like as expected. 
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" -- Harry -- "up from school." 
(Laughter) Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design, it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality. 
So, that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job. 
I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant, before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them. 
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. 
ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. 
But business has become much more complex. 
Thank you TED. Thank you. 
And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs, or code. 
What's in it for me? 
Soldier: Right there. 
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art. 
These teachers call themselves "pick-up artists." 
It made my building look sick. 
(Laughter) If you look at it, you're going to be blind, either temporarily or permanently. 
And I sat there for quite some time going, "How am I going to get off this rock and go home? 
And there's good news here. 
Our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old. 
In general we don't try to please the customer here. 
This is spontaneous repair. 
But they wrote a paper about this, and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed. 
Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. 
(Laughter) You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one. 
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education. 
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate. 
That's what it's shrunk to. 
Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want. 
And so a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3. 
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained. 
So the puzzle is, why are bribes, polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled? 
But nevertheless, the system has moved in a more liberal direction, moved in a more democratic direction. 
(Laughter) There's another thing happening around the country, which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. 
This boy here in the middle of central India -- this is in a Rajasthan village, where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process, they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. 
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast. 
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together. 
We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have. 
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water, but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe, and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market. 
They think more realistically about dangers than we do. 
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor, and he loves place-making, and place-making is when you have those mini-plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art, where people draw and come up and talk sometimes. 
Recording: Hi, my name is Ray, and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith. 
And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation, like when I get Mondays and all those days off. 
So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species. 
I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in. 
Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand. 
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something." 
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. 
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity, I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here, and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys. 
Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. 
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted. 
Every time I would go back, I would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces, and I would ask, "What happened?" 
You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money. 
But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society. 
Voice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil. 
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. 
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl. 
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix. 
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that. 
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff. 
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled. 
Instead, they've been hacked. 
Same with this -- it's a movie review, an art review, a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go. 
Thank you. 
But then I said, I want to go out with this information. 
So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically, and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. 
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that. 
It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. 
Now I did have an advantage. 
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. 
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs. 
If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't, we can start to design solutions to it. 
Well ... 
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups. 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Let me share with you today an original discovery. 
There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever, and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops. 
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. 
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. 
And as I look forward to what is next, it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. 
There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK? 
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. 
People have ridden seven million miles. 
So in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots, and where we're going to be going in the future, I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point, how we even came to believe that surgery was OK, that this was something that was possible to do, that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. 
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic. 
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. 
I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. 
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. 
I ordered them; they came by FedEx. 
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. 
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time, and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys, and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground — (Laughter) — kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist. 
Then, of course, the next question is: "Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?" 
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. 
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home. 
I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf, so this is a hemispheric issue. 
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal. 
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. 
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green -- is bigger than the Internet. 
Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right, the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times, and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early 1900s through now. 
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago. 
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago. 
This is a rugged and barren landscape, yet there are quite a few spiders here. 
(Applause) Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. 
How did it become the world's greatest economy? 
(Laughter) So, these are the words I am waiting to hear, but from my son, not my daughter. 
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in. 
As a kid, I was inspired by the literature of adventure and exploration, and I think we've all seen here this week the importance and the power of storytelling. 
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer. 
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite, like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket. 
He has been charged, about five days ago, with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50. 
One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know, by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context, if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. 
Beginning in 2004, every general came in saying, "I've inherited a dismal situation, but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy, which will deliver," in General Barno's word in 2004, the "decisive year." 
I want a blade of light across the Thames." 
And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. 
(Laughter) In total, they weigh 103.7 kilograms. 
This old man's grandfather refused to go. 
It had a separate memory and central processor. 
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me: taking turns, going up to their room, coming back, telling me jokes, distracting me. 
This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. 
In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own. 
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things. 
Building this system will also require a considerable investment. 
In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers. 
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability -- much worse than the car companies. 
We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction. 
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both. 
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage. 
So it started over here. 
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism. 
But more and more, in cases of DNA profiling -- this is another one -- we expect juries, who are ordinary people -- and it's documented they're very bad at this -- we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on. 
I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away. 
This is the second day in Rockett's life. 
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use. 
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be, what that transition could be that we're going through. 
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. 
The free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in, but as far as the law was concerned, they had nothing whatsoever in common. 
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter) My simple idea is that what's happened is, the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us, so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize, but which no longer exists. 
But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not like in a human sort of way. 
They are our body's own repair kits, and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies. 
And how do they effect us? 
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ... 
And then they're up again at eight in the morning. 
It's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough, what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive, comes out dead. 
So for TED we actually built a robot, over there, a prototype, with the tail. 
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda, that can be a model for Africa, and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world. 
And many blood transfusions later, I lived, and that made me special. 
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept -- is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future, a shared present and a common future. 
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do. 
The irony is, though, that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. 
In post-conflict situations, the reason that they so often revert to conflict, is not because elderly women get upset. 
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May. 
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. 
I pulled them aside. 
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. 
But it appeared to me that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords, by moneylenders, by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter, because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them. 
(Applause) But nothing, nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008. 
"Two boys hit me today in school. 
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that's part of the extra program. 
Thank you very much. 
So these programs -- and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk -- these prevention programs, simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies, and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. 
Thank you very much. 
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in. 
And as you get older and more decrepit, you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing, long staircase, leading you into oblivion. 
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing. 
I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. 
There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately I don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted to point out was a group from the University of Michigan which was able to take voting machines, the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that were going to be used in New Jersey in the election that were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it. 
Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything." 
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes! 
She was very tall, I would say. 
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. 
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn't have a toilet. 
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform. 
But not with business as usual. 
And you see the female line since 1984, the gap is widening. 
They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they're also looking at Africa. 
I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid, and I mourned that it was lost, mourned all I had not yet done, but was now impossible. 
The problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts, zealots, politicians and spectators. 
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other. 
Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking. 
And what they found was something unexpected. 
Thank you. 
Once you've got the mosquito in your area, anyone coming into that area with dengue, mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, and you'll get an epidemic. 
You think they can't possibly exist. 
And within those boundaries, they can carry a number of factors. 
He said, "That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need." 
We're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body, and that furthermore we can put in the body, they'll have their function, and then they'll dissolve away over time. 
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes." 
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. 
So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays, you think of a lot of things. 
You need two conditions: The first is that reasoners all care about their own well-being. 
(Laughter) And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening. 
So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food, which don't seem right now to have much in common, we can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. 
That's troubling, since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology. 
And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications, he was already in too deep. 
And then it was onto the saucer. 
The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that. 
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. 
My mother told me that, when I was a child, that I should always respect the little things. 
Here I've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last 20 years. 
Yeah, exactly. 
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 
And they get to make more sustainable products. 
They draw with crayons on the wall. 
Obviously nobody has been able to go back to 1930, get all the people born in one maternity unit, and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil, and then half of them eat McDonald's, and then we see how many wrinkles you've got later. 
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something. 
This was a completely surprising result. 
Thanks. Thank you. 
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?" 
And you might think, well, "Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?" 
(Laughter) It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock. 
We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist. 
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here, because structural engineers build bridges and big things, computer engineers, computers, but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves. 
Now this was 1973. 
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports. 
So when I thought about it, then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer. 
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this, that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. 
And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology. 
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries, not one country. 
In fact, traditional assessments like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives, lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. 
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. 
And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction? 
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. 
We're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential. 
The problem is we can't afford it. 
Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how? 
That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. 
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools, and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries. 
And I think we have lost our connection, and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment. 
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. 
Now, here we go, one side, the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. 
So having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything, because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda. 
That has a very high utility to prevent that damage. 
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. 
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted. 
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside. 
You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void. 
And there's several ways of doing this, but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. 
So I'll be talking about the success of my campus, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, in educating students of all types, across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. 
They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water. 
We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films. 
It could be something that we're remembered for, for millennia, for having achieved. 
We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. 
We're standing around with watering cans, when what we really need is the fire brigade. 
And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics, where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. 
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here, these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. 
And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost, and it looks like there's serious money to be made. 
Thank you. 
I had to do something. 
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, "Hey, can you deliver the pizza?" 
Sitting down is his brother Amjad. 
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this. 
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks. 
Those tries were elaborate. 
So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India? 
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed, was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident. 
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. 
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, "Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage." 
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. 
So you see how to find a synapse. 
And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice? 
And then, also, was working with broad strategies. 
(Laughter) This is was the problem: transparency -- free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem. 
So today, computer viruses and trojans, designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars. 
You immerse yourself in the water, and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea. 
That's not one of us." 
And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story. 
They’re going to save your grade, and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money, then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade." 
Thank you. 
They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told this was illegal. 
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. 
And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960, around the time of independence for many African states. 
So I decided to create a platform for that potential. 
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991. 
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from. 
(Applause) Henry Evans: Hello. 
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu, and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia. 
We have friends like USAID, the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Plan, WaterAid, that all believe for a win-win-win partnership. 
I know you did because half of Americans do every day. 
but please, those of you who are agents, and who are leading the customs officers into temptation, I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say any good things to you about this. 
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar, from flowers -- in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins -- but the female needs the blood meal. 
And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist. 
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back. 
And that's the difference between problems that are additive, like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip, and problems that are depletive, in which we lose what we have, which oscillate, and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got. 
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals, but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects, you have to understand a little bit about the back story. 
But the real big step was the neocortex. 
I've got a few more of these interesting ones. 
So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four? 
This is something I used to do as a joke -- you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" -- and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop. 
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard; it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. 
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down. 
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. 
It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks. 
But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. 
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it. 
How many trees does it have? 
But they keep hearing about people getting rich, and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real. 
The beauty and pleasure in art -- probably a human universal -- were -- began to be considered saccharine, or kitsch, or commercial. 
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!" 
If you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is. 
Buy African products. 
It's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up. 
(Applause) This intersection had been bland and anonymous. 
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. 
Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds, we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. 
So, it was a different India. 
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. 
Unlike the smashed glass of my car, plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility, with treatment, to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness. 
Because we too often talk about them as these strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, when in fact, it's quite an amazing story. 
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. 
Some say up to five tons. 
One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same, and once that's hammered home, it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. 
So, I opened up this TV Guide thing, and on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular. 
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. 
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. 
You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about, and then farther down, in tiny 10-point font, to find out how to actually get involved. 
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. 
In seven years, we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit. 
In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5. 
(Applause) Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company. 
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it. 
But if you give people vitamin D supplements, you don't change that high rate of heart disease. 
Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we haven't explored, or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into. 
Now, you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark. 
And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system. 
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard. 
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth. 
So a kid who's 14 in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem, which is a truly subtle and interesting proof, but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics. 
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector, while at the same time, stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level. 
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go. 
End of story. 
So what we would really like to do, is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism, but at the same time remain hopeful, benefiting from the many fruits of optimism. 
This is, like, this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. 
(Applause) It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk, which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia. 
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it. 
Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54. 
We called family, friends, the university authorities. 
They said, get me a tutor in what I suck at. 
We have to develop the gluten. 
And third, a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. 
We should abandon this idea of eradication. 
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?" 
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference. 
Who wrote that? 
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. 
So they would come up with all these ideas. 
We was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria. 
We can influence behavior. 
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school, they've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it's all up here. 
We got invited to do the whole thing in New York, and in London, and in Los Angeles. 
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him, "Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. 
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant, and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie, and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech, the "Rivers of Blood" speech. 
We're learning how to communicate with them, in really high-pitched tones. 
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. 
["Chair"] Orange, good. ["Table"] Green. 
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed. 
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. 
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from. 
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around. 
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources: it can come from fossil fuels, it can come from any way that you can create electricity, including renewables. 
But what about designing something that isn’t physical? 
Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat. 
And he explained to me that, when I shave, I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is, but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair, and this creates lack of symmetry. 
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain, because every brain is different. 
In other words, you need to understand how ideas have sex. 
On the contrary, it was completely linked in to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century. 
And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here, there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here -- I tried to make a relationship urbanistically. 
And they're pretty scary. 
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. 
The people who create these games are smart. 
In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil, not in supply, but in demand. 
They picked the name for their baby. 
So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. 
But let me show you how to work this device. 
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up. 
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy, a global festival to help us residents of Earth rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe. 
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. 
There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism, for democracy across Muslim-majority societies. 
This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan. 
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part, the public part -- well, they're both P's -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking. 
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. 
Or we push it down: they're more robust; there is less groups; but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. 
You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? 
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas. 
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime? 
This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy insecurity, energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe. 
The men climbed for eight hours straight, and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light, and as soon as light broke, they attacked. 
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man, we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty." 
We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters -- the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius -- vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. 
And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing, or 3D printing. 
This is his sister. 
If it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens. 
So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them. 
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured, until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean. 
So 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it, no one certainly in the European environment. 
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life. 
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. 
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. 
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors.

And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. 
The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. 
They're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years, or maybe even thousands of years, are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai. 
Look at what she has done. 
And in papercutting, you have the drawing as the structure itself. 
Use biotechnology where useful, particularly in pest and disease resistance. 
But behind, the average team is trying to catch up. 
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years. 
But just like any other technology, vaccines have their shortcomings, and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative -- this old technology. 
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple. 
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree, and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. 
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office, have more power to do good than at any time in history, because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. 
You can see here, the small planets dominate the picture. 
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. 
Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone. 
And the snail's wired to a stick, so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah. 
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said, "Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life." 
But you'll notice the level of excitement. 
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever. 
And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with. 
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while. 
You can see that in 1635, it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever. 
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity. 
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change, when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow, and then it all disappears.

But people would come in -- and this was before the pirate movies and everything! 
Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '70s. 
You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise, it maps to a spike in unemployment. 
One, the red line, is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income. 
So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it. 
But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature. 
And it's made today in these difficult economic times. 
(Music) These are all troubles outside of myself. 
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? 
Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. 
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different. 
And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. 
But did the regime learn anything? Not really. 
This is the same dry water body. 
Thank you very much. 
Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that. 
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference? 
Which card shall I use? Queen or five? 
We call this gravitational lensing. 
It's helping all of us to connect. 
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. 
And it is no secret that many Islamic movements in the Middle East tend to be authoritarian, and some of the so-called "Islamic regimes" such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst case was the Taliban in Afghanistan -- they are pretty authoritarian. No doubt about that. 
Well, you've got mail. 
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic, could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences, but they could still sing the lyrics to a song, whether it was "Happy Birthday To You" or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. 
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right. 
It was like the ultimate perk.

And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby. 
They are my heroes and my father is my hero, who understood democracy and guided me through it. 
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention, the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. 
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations, what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. 
The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. 
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence. 
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. 
And how far can you take that? How far can you take it? 
I'm sure you'll be content together." 
We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. 
Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws. 
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree. 
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower and I could be taken to a critical care hospital. 
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. 
They become rarer because we fish them. 
And you might fairly ask: why is that? 
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done. 
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. 
As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people -- we might as well get it right. 
So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory. 
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the Brits in India, there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians. 
And the Chinese government has now -- I work with the Chinese government now -- has taken this up. 
All men are created equal. 
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy. 
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance.

Look, ours is more red, it's longer. 
What we do is actually this. 
It's in his book "The Four Loves."

Thank you very much. 
Because at its core, it's about empowerment. 
From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. 
And they tried everything they had. 
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.

This is a floppy disk -- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A. 
He said, "So here is a list of people that you can call, and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want."

Be the first. People will follow you. 
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. 
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005. 
Some architectures. 
All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung, urine and litter or mulch, as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand, and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain, to store carbon, and to break down methane. 
So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules -- nucleotides -- together.

You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. 
If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits, you get a completely different answer, which is clearly conservation makes more sense, and not destruction. 
Is that something that you are still invested in, that you still believe in the notion of investment? 
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. 
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. 
You had this same thing in America, it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.

Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church. 
For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth, was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.

So we are past our 1,000th show. 
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. 
Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. 
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet, but 80 percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands. 
I often talk to refugees: "Why was it that the West didn't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics, not by weather?" 
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. 
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. 
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests. 
And then, in the same year, we almost lost everything. 
CA: And malaria's even further behind? 
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this. 
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? 
So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so. 
AK: Other emotional stuff. 
In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. 
Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules? 
Acting with intent. 
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child, guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights. 
Good news: I found three that I particularly liked, the first by Samuel Johnson, who said, "When making your choice in life, do not forget to live," the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that "happiness is a choice that requires effort," and the third is one by Groucho Marx who said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member." 
We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. 
I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up, whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves, in fact, with the waste of San Diego, or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades. 
There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. 
(Applause) I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making. 
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough, the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. 
That's an unnatural act for a rocket. 
My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat. 
I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used. 
People panic. 
And this is exactly what she said to me. 
It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. 
Do you understand?" 
She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. 
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision, compare it to the amount of energy before, and if there's less energy after the collision than before, this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. 
This is a corruption. 
And so what happens is, we waste more food. 
Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce, "You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great, but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you" — (Laughter) — "so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises." 
And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. 
From the simplest version in nature, one branch, my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley, had made the first synthetic version. 
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life. 
And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. 
And everywhere there were these terrible problems. 
We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. 
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President, addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse, making them feel a part of it. 
But in this case we cracked it, but a big part of the problem still remains. 
But I didn't have to cut any of them really, because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14. 
And if you zoom in, you can definitely watch this, grandparents with their grandchildren, distributing the natural enemies, the good bugs, instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. 
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 -- showed that you didn't even need subtraction. 
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food." 
He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted. 
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville. 
Yes, this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement. 
It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car, and you just dumped it in the ocean. 
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me." 
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee, we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry, and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. 
The message reads, [Arabic] "You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring." 
And eventually, we can come up with something like this. 
He had a side parting and a neat mustache. 
We've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations. 
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health, we must preserve nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. 
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it. 
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. 
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks. 
Thirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter, and this was someone saying "temblor," which means earthquake. 
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit, of which Windows has not some, [but] several? 
Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. 
And if you think about space, everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space. 
What we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress, and the place we want to get to is 75. 
We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said. 
But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. 
And you can see we got a guy from -- who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us, down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything. 
Noise becomes music. 
Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live. 
I thought maybe the mirror box was gone. 
So what's the population today? 
So they're very popular. 
Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break. 
That means their immune systems are compromised. 
I mean, think about how much we love this. 
We feel awe, we feel pity. 
The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. 
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here. 
So we only grow what we need. 
False. 
♫ Which raced sideways blowing ♫ ♫ Blowing ♫ ♫ Blowing ♫ ♫ May came home with a smooth, round stone ♫ ♫ Small as a world and as large as alone ♫ (Music) ♫ For whatever we lose like a you or a me ♫ ♫ Always ourselves that we find at the sea ♫ (Applause) Thank you. 
You've got to work with the building department. 
Why mountain rescue? 
There was a very interesting film, one of the rare good films done about a situation like this, by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition. 
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. 
So, doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-living and living systems. 
And by the way, that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q., about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. 
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria. 
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere, I think, is a forgone conclusion, at least in my own mind. 
And you know, the reality is that between farmers in America, who actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest, are pretty large in general. 
What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. 
(Laughter) But back in 2009, the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science. 
My right leg will be unburdened, my right foot will freely meet the wire. 
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. 
How far and how fast is up to us. 
Let me wrap with two key messages. 
I've failed them. 
He was a new man, taller again. 
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again. 
We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route, even though nobody had been there before, to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life. 
On an elemental level, we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth. 
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town. 
Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa, and I'm still searching for my identity, but I saw Ghana create democracy better. 
We carry in our face the proof that cooking, food transformation, made us what we are. 
Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. 
With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica, you can, for example, make precise programs that call on real world data. 
We can begin to zoom into them. 
Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle? 
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're, much to the distress of my children, they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them. 
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language, they are receiving it and representing it, and in information it's representing crap. 
And moreover, it has to work. 
And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right? 
Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature? And these parameters, these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism. 
And 250 countries all competing. 
The chimp is going to see, watch carefully, they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure — that's fast, that's eight movie frames — of numbers one, two, three, four, five. 
In my warped little industry, that's my brand. 
It was ubiquitous. 
Here's why. 
We've driven 140,000 miles. 
The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. 
So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison. 
Ahh! We come upon them, the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out. 
That's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision. 
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent, omniscient -- too far above us. 
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor. 
It was an experimental education program. 
We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century, and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out. 
(Laughter) But as soon as you walk in, I go, "Ooh. Spaghetti sauce there." 
And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. 
(Laughter) "And the dawn came." So they ran all night. 
(Applause) Yay! (Applause) Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause) As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world. 
This was my medical kit. 
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage. 
We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making, where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. 
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. 
And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her. 
My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. 
Each one has his story. 
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head? 
Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all. 
I know you're there because I can hear you, but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses. 
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. 
(Applause) So what brings the different entities to the table? 
Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed. 
One, two, three. 
And we're moving in a full circle now. 
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. 
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that. 
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. 
It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging. 
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. 
The bigger question is, what do you do about the value down here? 
JH: And they're non-deterministic. 
(Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. 
But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry, a first act in thrust, an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena, and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits. 
These are cane toads in Australia. 
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. 
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors. 
It's crazy. 
And those red molecules are hemoglobin. 
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy. 
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it. 
They knock themselves off. 
And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong. 
It was a mad race to get that rubber, and the man on the left, Julio Arana, is one of the true thugs of the story. 
So this same technique should probably look at all. 
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich." 
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is. 
So a very diverse group of people. 
So very small changes can have a big impact. 
I think that now I feel nervous. 
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have. 
And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around. 
(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together. 
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. 
More than 30 towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate. 
So where to from here? 
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir, and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships. 
The world was changing. 
Venture capitalists are those guys who want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs. 
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. 
From lots of experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment. 
How do all these components get to the clinic? 
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal. 
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK. 
Well, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw, and doing a thousand trials a day and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice, we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making. 
So if the field's been around for so long, why so few clinical advances? 
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat, and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice, but it's being lost. 
Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out! 
This tracks your activity and also your sleep. 
Others will hold back. But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country." 
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. 
Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire? 
So the first day, this is the big one. 
We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments. 
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him. 
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. 
To dispose others to engage in the same practices. 
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture. 
There are 146 top players in the core, and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the TNCs' value. 
She handled the national press, and she was a star. 
And they fly into the erupting volcano. 
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. 
(Applause) I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange, but we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day. 
I used to work for an educational publisher, and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories or fun, engaging language, because then my work might not be viewed as "serious" and "scientific." 
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. 
He never mentioned that journey. 
We Americans move on the average every five years. 
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. 
To show you how schizophrenic this all is, here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company, being asked, well, with the writers' strike, isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online? 
And he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race, of any party -- in history. 
So freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter) So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory. 
(Laughter) And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night, the sidewalk still warm from the sun, watching the skies for UFOs. 
We will venture into outer space, and we will start inhabiting outer space. 
Math is a much broader subject than calculating. 
We work to promote healthy vibrant societies, to ameliorate human suffering, to promote a more thoughtful, substantive, empathic world order. 
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. 
That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland. 
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people. 
For example, he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino-Japanese War, a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. 
Okay. So here's the read on it. 
They are some of our finest instruments, our new technology in the ocean today. 
And it was an invitation you do not refuse. 
So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. 
I can't build a drug. 
Now, for us environmentalists, maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb. 
Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold, they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery, the still vast unknown, the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. 
And actually the second general hospital in Vienna, in about 1850, was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. 
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby. 
It's been done in voles. 
All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger, something that might happen wrong, and yet we like it when there's protection. 
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect? 
They come to us with a request for a loan. 
They're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them. 
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all. 
So let's talk about those three As. 
First of all, they can give employees and customers more control. 
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago, which is related to the fact that I never -- and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters, there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand, but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific, technical, entertainment career as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools. 
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest. 
So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany, and we had the Catholic priest over, my mother was entertaining him with tea. 
That's the consequence that we have to face. 
No video here, so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics, of a new kind of trajectory: gaga to water. 
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways, is actually India. 
Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. 
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games, and we say, "No criticism," and you get all these weird, neat ideas. 
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far -- built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools, my readers, at this point. 
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table. 
You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot, and you can remove its foot. 
Which leads us to the last one, which is our elections. 
Now, are we going to pull through? 
This is a new work, it's a new program. 
There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly, I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight. 
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses. 
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, "How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?" 
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers. 
And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis. 
(Laughter) No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it, once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day, but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished, you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. 
Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication. 
You make it flow under and over. 
I bet a lot of you do, right? 
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter) I think this was truly fantastic. 
Let me show you some examples. 
So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday," current rain, "It is raining now," or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow." 
Because there is no profit in it. 
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. 
The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. 
Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives? 
These are very compelling, vivid sensations. 
And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them, and he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy." 
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. 
And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother. 
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community, to be successful -- and they're very ambitious. 
I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others, looking at America from that point of view. 
Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. 
So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people, is that these are neighborhoods. 
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. 
And 2004, the net profit, after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars. 
It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership. 
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment, at first rate. 
The urban honey is delicious. 
(Laughter) And I'm going to admit something to you. 
(Laughter) But if we move on and think throughout history how people have used different materials in the body, very often it's been physicians that have been quite creative. 
We've already seen examples of this working well. 
If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss, they're not going to be saving for retirement. 
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this -- I had to unveil something. 
So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that. 
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that. 
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. 
Now that's an incredible phenomena, because it's a star that sits there. 
There's a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language. 
(Applause) I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on involving a man named Steve Titus. 
(Laughter) Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist; I don't understand string theory. 
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. 
So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. 
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is: What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself? 
You read about it, you hear about it. 
The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue. 
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. 
And suddenly, everything that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever. 
I fit into it, you fit into it, and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. 
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. 
What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know. 
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it. 
It is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you, that might stay with you, from long, long ago, or from right this minute, from far away or from right close to where you live, almost no matter where you live. 
Umar is seven years old, and he's from northern Nigeria. 
And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something. 
This software can also be networked between domes. 
I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees. 
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for. 
And on the animal on the right, you see that the cancer was responding. 
That is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older. 
Here is a way we can get people to critical care. 
(Applause) (Laughter) (Music) (Applause) Joe Kowan: I have stage fright. 
It's filled with this toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide. 
But this man doesn't need to go there. 
I don't want to romanticize poverty. 
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. 
(Laughter) Now, I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today. 
(Laughter) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional. 
But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s -- real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. 
Gone very fast, disappeared. 
The cells round up for division, but they're very static in that position. 
(Laughter) You'll never find Indian women so precise. 
The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. 
GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends. 
I knew there were Portuguese men o' war, all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things, but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters. 
My hope is that many, many other home-grown African institutions will blossom, and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of African leaders, generation four, and they will teach them this common message: create jobs, build our institutions. 
And this all changed in the late 19th century. 
The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with: the massive information revolution. 
In three minutes, you just fold this up. 
This is pretty stunning, but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. 
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. 
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far. 
Now, I did not speak Portuguese. 
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be, "Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour. 
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant, and all kinds of stuff. 
So there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit. 
(Music) Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader. 
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. 
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful. 
Green carbon, which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions, and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions. 
Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover, we couldn't use airbags. 
It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else, but it's going to be worth your time." 
As the author of the study told me, children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative have greater self-confidence. 
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? 
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas, and we had looked for a week, and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. 
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do. 
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata, but we'd never seen anything like this: Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata. 
They're becoming like computers in open air. 
These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. 
A middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage, and his steam-driven computers that were never built. 
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds, and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds, and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds. 
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex. 
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. 
And it starts with three people. 
And yet, in many places, a third of the children, by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this. 
RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing. 
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid, discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. 
(Applause) HH: Thank you very much. 
(Laughter) RSW: Frank had a sort of ... 
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. 
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. 
So today, you can download products from the Web -- anything you would have on your desktop, like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers. 
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. 
Could you please show that? 
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers, so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot. 
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from. 
Here what I call "the spinal brain" cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk, to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving. 
See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the home of Bethlehem Steel. 
There's nobody to stick up for the future self. 
People who sell us fossil fuels. 
Because he was building these crops. 
What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. 
And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other. 
We want to stop that tail from resorbing. 
So let me show you something. 
So we need tools. 
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before. 
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling, or they may be isolated in the corner, or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements, in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere. 
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. 
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese -- and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this -- the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. 
And us, and I, and us are all part of you. 
You have to go in a school bus." 
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know, could we have it for a second? 
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left. 
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently -- again, largely skull shape. 
(Applause) So, people of the TED community, I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. 
Thank you very much. 
And this is true. 
Thank you. SP: Thank you. 
And even though that turned out to be nothing, nothing at all -- (Laughter) -- merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... 
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you. 
I started going out on cases. 
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called. 
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. 
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project, you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model. 
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures, wrote a series of books about my travels, including "Walking the Bible." 
That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization. 
There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. 
These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership, the real privilege of leadership, which is after all to serve humanity. 
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. 
But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking, and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas. 
They got their title of respectability. 
We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I'll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. 
(Laughter) CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right? 
I saw my own internist last week, and he said to me, "You know," and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free, but I paid him for the privilege, which is that I need to lose some weight. 
♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫ ♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫ ♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫ ♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫ ♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫ ♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ Yeah, yeah ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ (Applause) Thank you. 
So what I did was I made an adventure strip. 
(Applause) As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. 
What does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4-second reverberation time? 
And what I've found is, rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things, they invested in a school feeding program. 
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool. 
Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. 
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud. 
All the tumors were gone. 
Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. 
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining, without crying, while they sang things like: "Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water," and "I done done," "This little light of mine." 
She's pregnant and a widow. 
You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves. 
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish, he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one. 
Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot. 
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth. 
(Applause) When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s. 
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that. 
During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard, I watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-required courses in science because they were afraid of failure. 
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. 
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service, you might use an E.V. to commute, you get a truck because you're doing a home project. 
(Video) Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you? 
There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix. 
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer, then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote -- the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive." 
I'm calling this The Great Unwind. 
Where do they get their money? 
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this. 
And you're focused on me and why I'm such a great guy, and why you want to invest in me. 
We use these every day. 
Please join us by working together. 
In that hospice, there were 31 men and women who were actively dying. 
And I asked millions of people, without questioning my right to do so, to go up against the government. 
CA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon. 
Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building? 
If you look inside that beaker, you might see a candle. 
That's the part of us that yearns for God, or something more than we find in technology. 
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. 
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea, whose effects we've only just begun to see. 
It takes a long time to learn how to do that, and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture, this way of doing it, these rocks, had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations. 
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. 
And that's just to start. 
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know. 
They're super industrious. 
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too." 
And the question is this: How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s? 
And I want to start with a bit on technology, because, of course, this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. 
Nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here. 
These very same people are strong believers, in lots of contexts, in the limits on the markets. 
But all is not lost in translation. 
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. 
And I challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this. 
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. 
We've got to give them all of these opportunities. 
Very interesting side effect here, here's a slide from Phillip Longman. 
What do you mean, hiring people who have backgrounds? 
When I was about five years old, not very much -- about a year after Mr. Ford made his predictions, I was living in a rural part of Canada, on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area. 
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything. 
But I know from my work how much fiction is already in there. 
I have been to the mountain top, and I have seen the Promised Land." 
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫ Get that idiot out! 
So many books about war say the same thing, that nothing brings people together like war. 
(Laughter) So let's see what happens. 
I really was moved. 
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work. 
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it. 
Fusion is very hard to do. 
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern. 
(Applause) KB: Escaping arranged marriages, I chose my own husband across the world in L.A., a really different world. 
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things. 
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. 
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on. 
And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. 
And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time. 
Not one, but 50 percent. 
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns, there's something beautiful looking back at you, that's deliberate. 
When I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues, we never talk about what we know. 
Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth. 
You know, the slaughter plants, I've worked with them in the '80s; they were absolutely awful. 
Let me give you an example: in Turkey where I come from, which is a very hyper-secular republic, until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police, which would guard the universities against veiled students. 
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day? 
These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes. 
And then we looked at the maps, and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave, because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics. 
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. 
It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish. 
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity. 
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes, which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. 
I have a small lab. 
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell. 
I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. 
I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years. 
For the Hollywood people in the audience, this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies: it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures, so the market for those movies is larger. 
They're just choosing randomly. 
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter. 
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else. 
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. 
And the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas. 
There are regulations that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically. 
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support, but also a set of encouragements that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard, but we refuse to let you fail." 
The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement. 
And you see, you're very familiar with this. 
So the question is, how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve? 
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. 
And the choice we face, I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world, isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in. 
There's this incredible complexity in the CPU, and this incredible regularity in the memory. 
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes. 
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another, and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness. 
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. 
The CDC has a program, Heads Up. 
So that's idea one: recognize interdependence. 
I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me. 
Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands. 
Now, we actually play through many generations here, at the cellular scale. 
But that's the lectures. 
Even if the competition is the old way of doing something. 
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult, and even when we had electric typewriters, or then computer keyboards, the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly. 
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages." 
You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up and said he's going to talk about hope, and all he's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale." 
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends. 
So I will not really go too far into it. 
So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do. 
You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out, that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. 
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games -- by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. 
And if we remove the mystery of life, then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live, and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are. 
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling, but like too many others, they misunderstand its basic causes. 
(Laughter) Went to Afghanistan. 
For example, name your best friend, your favorite kind of vacation, what's your favorite hobby, what's your favorite kind of music. 
It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors. 
Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves, which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers. 
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like -- we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening. 
My family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California, and we moved from the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines. 
It's used all over the place. 
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl. 
I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy. 
This is going up into the turret. 
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house, and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet. 
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. 
And as I discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day, I discovered what truly remained. 
And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc. 
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. 
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. 
Bess: Yes, my lady. 
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media. 
So Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference. 
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason. 
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building. 
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. 
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation. 
Now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance, like, "I love chocolate" -- everyone needs to be able to say that— fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. 
They do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things, and you can't tell the difference. 
We don't want one icon. 
They give us our identity and a sense of community. 
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations. 
Didn't know I had one." 
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning. 
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?" 
(Laughter) It's too late. That is gone. 
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced. 
The differences were dramatic. 
And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is. 
And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it. 
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in. 
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. 
We have the androids that are inspired by man. 
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD. 
Some people say it's not population decline. 
Or the interesting company SunRun. 
That's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children. 
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. 
Outside Haiti also, things were looking different. 
We're using it to make better ignorance, to come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance. 
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. 
And I say, "Empathy. 
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. 
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. 
(Laughter) It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come. 
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. 
(Laughter) And some of them, many of them actually, had water that came into more than one room. 
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period. 
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it, and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. 
Thank you. 
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven, which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. 
There are now a couple of hundred thousand. 
When you adopt a tool, you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool, and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work the way the Linux community worked. 
(Laughter) Because it could run all the time. 
The last. 
And that doesn't even count, for example, that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. 
He's leaving red ink behind. 
In each little drop of water you get 50 billion of these guys. 
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ. 
There is one battle that illustrates that. 
And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance. 
We could use sales, anything you like. 
And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. 
Now one other thing happened around this same time. 
And when I'm on my bike, I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. 
They're here, getting better and better every day. 
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. 
Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice. 
(Applause) I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause) Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy. 
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch. 
So Amanda came jet-lagged, she's using the arm, and everything goes wrong. 
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. 
Which is something you never want to do professionally. 
I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. 
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. 
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. 
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain, going down your spinal cord, out the nerves and to your periphery. 
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. 
However, the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation, especially in the context of externally-funded research. 
I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year. 
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs. 
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. 
And I recognized that oftentimes design, when you're set up to see design, it can be a bit of a letdown. 
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. 
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. 
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force. 
It took about 17 minutes to do a single page. 
(Applause) So seriously, is there a dark side? 
And it will be really boring. It will read like this. 
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator. 
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book, "Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book, nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don't belong in schools. 
Except, if you think life is also defined by things that die, you're not in luck with this thing, because that's actually a very strange organism. 
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone. 
Potholes, of course, that can become a problem, but we have a solution. 
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. 
And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact, there's an econometric study, the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that. 
Actually, sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. 
And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need, and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing, a planning process, and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social, environmental, economic complexity. 
And teachers are also frustrated. 
So when I asked him, he told me three things. 
It's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there. 
It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example, we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln because of the movie. 
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease, and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. 
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade. 
Daily life in our country is, to say the least, under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances. 
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? 
And each gene gives us a fingerprint. 
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design. 
(Music) All right, so it's a delicate dance. 
Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world, and the idea of getting this group of people together -- some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas -- I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference. 
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney, I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser. 
You need efforts to supplement schools. 
In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. 
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. 
To close, I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. 
But again, those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal, to take the data, to take the observations, of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. 
Our next questions was: Could we actually visualize this spread? 
For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation. 
I heard an 80-year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that. 
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today. 
But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle: our science and technology. 
And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. 
So we are four of us in four corners of the world. 
I mean, there's no paper on the desk. 
For example, this construction, the dative, is used not only to transfer things, but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas, as when we say, "She told a story to me" or "told me a story," "Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish." 
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich. 
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds. 
Thank you. 
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. 
It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah, I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far, and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes, and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need, you know. 
And we even text at funerals. 
For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. 
That's an interesting idea." 
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. 
I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow, I would pull out this whole other dimension, that I would collapse it, that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. 
Even though it pricked my conscience then, I could not, or rather I did not tend to her or assist her, because I was busy building my real estate company. 
And the goal of RoboCup, the actual goal is, by the year 2050 we want to have full size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win. 
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. 
And then he can see that at the same time. 
And he went around the country after that. 
And then as they grow older, the horns grow forward. 
Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world. 
People are less kind. There is less trust around. 
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it (Laughter), and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. 
Yes, great. I see people going down like this. 
But this is not an ancient conflict. 
So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data, then what I could do, turn it away. 
So that's what the mastery of fear can do -- not only faced with machine guns, but if you meet a knife fight in the street. 
And they didn't know that. 
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars -- 25 percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in the U.K. 
A cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me." 
And a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from. 
But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today. 
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one. 
So, armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology, I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15. 
And actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? 
Fast forward four years later, after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country, and — ("No more bathing!") — I can't say any more than that. (Laughter) I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath-substituting lotion. 
We constantly have to kind of dial them back. 
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. 
And this is how we come to care for the common good. 
And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen. 
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock, it stands. 
Because this thing codes ones and zeros, and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there, absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right? 
It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals. 
And I thought, "Well, hey! 
But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector. 
So, this used to be completely smooth. 
But very, very recently, it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies. 
They were startling, compelling and credible. 
Then, another bathroom upstairs. 
I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars." 
And so he did. 
Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out. 
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort. 
So this is the distribution that you get if, in fact, there is no life. 
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long. 
This looks like a giant hamburger. 
Why are we embedded in social networks? 
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices. 
Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation? 
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger. 
And again, my question is, what does technology want? 
And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. 
It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. 
That is a nice sideline of open government. 
So in second grade, all the kids are interested in science, the girls and the boys. 
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. 
The big brain integrates signals, which come from the running programs of the lower brain, But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. 
Europe in the 19th century: a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning, used to describe it as the "European concert of powers." 
If you're born after 1950, this is just -- consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane. 
And yeah, I stand before you now. 
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you, but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies, or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate. 
How about 15 seconds? 
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable, that the air flow and temperature is just right. 
We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have. 
And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy. 
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail. 
That's human heart. 
How did they get there? Do I have to do that? 
You know, historically, we didn't do that. 
And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial. 
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death. 
They are the poorest of the poor. 
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it. 
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump -- Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me -- and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. 
But in evolution, cooperation -- though competition exists, of course -- cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity. 
Now working memory has four basic components. 
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy, the beauty of the canopy, the necessity of intact canopies, to people outside of academia. 
Is it that I write very well? 
And hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do. 
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900, two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year. 
(Applause) PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper. 
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel. 
I felt obsolete. 
But why is it important? 
You can manipulate it yourself. 
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh." 
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill, the blue line is a good line. 
But they have the worst of all superpowers: invisibility. 
But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up -- then I grew up. 
Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions. 
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger. 
So that's the personal reason. 
As a mom that one just -- The next message comes a month later. 
It's like, "Ugh," so that's what we do. (Laughter) I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives, because they can be anything. 
There's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness. 
Torvalds is the most famous open-source programmer, created Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way the open-source movement had been dealing with this problem. 
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. 
So, he was like a kid in a candy store. 
But it should be be perfect enough, because nature doesn't do perfect either. 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. 
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. 
So we had to create one. 
I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize. 
Thank you. 
But to really see the details of the bee, and really appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer. 
But luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says, "We can do better. We can build this better." 
(Applause) You've been a great audience. 
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex. 
Simple question: if you can't read and write, how do you manage your contact information? 
You don't wake up one day no longer a racist. 
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right? 
In light of this observation on contemporary love, how can we think of love in the years to come? 
He started a motorbike company. 
Five women, representing five continents, and three Olympic gold medal winners. 
It's not difficult to discern that there are differences. 
So I told the singers, "That's our goal. 
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze. 
Different shapes for different phonemes, right? 
Now if you look at Hong Kong, they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. 
Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory. 
Once all the missing persons are identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. 
You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. 
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. 
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth, for jobs, as well as for financial stability, global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared, and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. 
It was a moving demonstration of what the words "united nations" are supposed to mean: a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good. 
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so. 
A few years ago, the first sea lord of the British admiralty -- he is called the first sea lord, although the chief of the army is not called a land lord — he said that we, and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West, that we suffer from sea blindness. 
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale. 
But holding onto that structure we built around the daring, independence, self-sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster. 
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. 
It's a language that's still evolving. 
She wanted to dance. 
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented. 
Didn't you feel any pity for your victims? 
And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend. 
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. 
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was: Did she marry? 
But there are some exceptions. 
Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer. 
But of course, you cannot understand Venice if you just look at the city. 
This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons: One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful. 
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at TED, in clean energy, in clean education, in development, if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled, we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow, then we must all participate, then we must get involved. 
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. 
Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis. 
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there. 
Keep that in mind. 
That was her fight. 
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture. 
After this, they were scientists, professionals with a particular scientific method, goals, societies and funding. 
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera, and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. 
So since we can't predict the future, we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. 
JA: Yeah. And you know, I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crime. 
So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. 
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. 
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies. 
That's still true today. 
Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. 
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. 
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do. 
And, you know, built the society that we now live in. 
And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. 
the moment that very popular TV shows end. 
And this is what people did. 
It already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it, but it's hard to get. 
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit. 
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. 
(Laughter) This is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force. 
And we even know something about the way the brain does this. 
Now, why is this important to have this model? 
What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea. 
Sometimes we just forget. 
The agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before. 
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you. 
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. 
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath, and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena, or a gymnasium. 
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement? And the most obvious one is to look at the sky, and so we thought, now what could they be looking at in the sky? 
And I thought, would that happen in any other industry? 
And you see him do it again. 
And so B.C. in Barcelona and B-cycle and Boris Bikes in London -- no one has had to repeat the version 1.0 screw-ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. 
In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. 
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly. 
I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006. 
We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. 
So the images that you saw at the beginning, they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle, and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees. 
Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been, neither to oversell the role of technology, but these things have given a sense of what's possible when the age-old model of power, the pyramid, gets turned upside down, putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were. 
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life." 
But the reality is that polio still exists today. 
I mean this is the iPhone 4. 
Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.

Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation. 
You don't see it in the newspaper every day. 
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh? 
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river, like sand mining, for example, very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge, not allowing the animals to breed anymore, we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial, despite the early good intentions. 
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window. 
These red dots, these red areas, basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. 
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other? 
One -- who knows what she's going through; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. 
And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. 
You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building -- put fluff in the walls, fluff in the roof, and a new front door and so forth, and the sad truth is, this will save you money. 
It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster -- it's a race. 
Thank you very much. 
MS: The greatest benefit to all. 
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer. 
The next movement is called mobs. 
And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. 
But actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands. 
We are in the middle of an astonishing period. 
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house. 
And not having to know history's next mad rage or regression, it might be a relief. 
And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. 
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. 
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you, and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next effect that I'll show you, which is this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect, so it became a seamless experience for them, that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation, I was showing you what you wanted to see. 
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces. 
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. 
And I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting. 
When our birthday rolled around, it was the first we wouldn't be spending together. 
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes? 
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional, we start not with a single surface, but with a volume. 
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised -- maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor: How do you go about it? 
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. 
This one weighs three tons. 
We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. 
This can be in spirituality. 
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies. 
I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe, studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. 
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry. 
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. 
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. 
How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? 
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill, nor am I asking anyone for their pity. 
Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma, three times what it was in the '90s, and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. 
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex. 
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right. 
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit.

In Kenya, in August, I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls, a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. 
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. 
Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult. 
And then back to simplicity again. 
A place like Chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature. 
What do I mean by fluent? 
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. 
That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal -- changes. 
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.

And it has no DNA. 
So I don't talk about it anymore. 
Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live. 
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class, and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing," which I found both erroneous and profound.

By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin, is going to be about 200,000. 
And economists have actually started worrying about that. 
So I went in for an ultrasound. 
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace, with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence. 
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that. 
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh." 
The photo was horrible. 
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth? 
That will be the future. 
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. 
That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome. 
The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. 
And what happens is, she says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl." 
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so -- plumber, general, plumber, general -- so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one. 
We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations. 
I would say it probably measures ... 
So that is the House of Tata. 
This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together. 
When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders -- these are behavior problems.

Today, 6,800 of those are extinct, no longer to be seen again. 
In fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of Sweden. 
And I used three criteria: the first was, I thought I'd talk about real design within reach, design that's free, not design not quite within reach, as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors, but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free, stuff that was available to all people, and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. 
(Laughter) It's a blind computer. 
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software, and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. 
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.

What they don't say is, "Well the numbers all seem to add up, but before I present this idea, I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better." 
And when you think about it, it's very true: what we all most desire is a penis -- or "happiness" as we say in English.

And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty. 
And it's beautiful.

That's how much of a latterly thing writing is. 
This time it's not a cheese sandwich. 
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts. 
And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.
