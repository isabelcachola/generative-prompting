    "845": "That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning. = 3 hari kemudian, sesudah semua orang pergi dari rumah, ibu saya memanggil perawat.\nAnd I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. =",
    "846": "And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. = Dan Hans membuat kesimpulan yang mengatakan, \"Lihat, benar-benar penting untuk memiliki banyak data.\"\nSo that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations. =",
    "847": "This is not what our parliament would do.
