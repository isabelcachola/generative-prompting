    "1370": "And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal? = Tantangan itu adalah: Bagaimana melakukan bisnis, bagaimana mempercayai seseorang di Internet untuk berbisnis walaupun mereka adalah kriminal?\nAnd, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. =",
    "1371": "And it's specifically algorithms, which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. = Terutama algoritma, yang pada intinya adalah matematika yang digunakan komputer untuk mengambil keputusan.\nI mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. =",
