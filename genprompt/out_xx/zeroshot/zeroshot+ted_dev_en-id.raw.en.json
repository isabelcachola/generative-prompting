    "208": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we watched them and I'm so thankful, because she's just like, \"Wow! This is so amazing.\" A:",
    "209": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of She goes, \"What about dogs?\" A:",
    "210": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So we put in dogs mating, and, you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed. A:",
    "211": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then she goes, \"Mom, do you think they would have, on the Internet, any humans mating?\" A:",
    "212": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year old's hand, and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter) And I looked into this trusting, loving face, and I said, \"Oh, no. A:",
    "213": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That would never happen.\" A:",
    "214": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. A:",
    "215": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Thank you. A:",
    "216": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. A:",
    "217": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data, to put your data on the web, on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data, scientific data, community data, whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things, in ways that they never could have imagined. A:",
    "218": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, today I'm back just to show you a few things, to show you, in fact, there is an open data movement afoot, now, around the world. A:",
    "219": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The cry of \"Raw data now!\" A:",
    "220": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of which I made people make in the auditorium, was heard around the world. A:",
    "221": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, let's roll the video. A:",
    "222": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up, was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED -- Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government, blogged, \"Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is, it's about bicycle accidents.\" A:",
    "223": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Two days it took the Times Online to make a map, a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. A:",
    "224": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here's more data, traffic survey data, again, put out by the U.K. government, and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards, then a user could just make a map, just by clicking. A:",
    "225": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008. A:",
    "226": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Look at Zanesville, Ohio. A:",
    "227": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant, and which houses are there, which houses have been connected to the water. A:",
    "228": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And he got, from other data sources, information to show which houses are occupied by white people. A:",
    "229": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt, between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either. A:",
    "230": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars. A:",
    "231": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's the power of taking one piece of data, another piece of data, putting it together, and showing the result. A:",
    "232": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. A:",
    "233": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site, Where Does My Money Go. A:",
    "234": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. A:",
    "235": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can burrow down by a particular type of spending, or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. A:",
    "236": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. A:",
    "237": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Yes, certainly you can do it over here. A:",
    "238": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. A:",
    "239": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California, you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. A:",
    "240": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov, and data.gov.uk. A:",
    "241": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red. A:",
    "242": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of How can you use this stuff? A:",
    "243": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places you can take, from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses, you can make paper, print off a paper which has got very, very specific things about the bus stops, the things specifically near you. A:",
    "244": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of On a larger scale, this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. A:",
    "245": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. A:",
    "246": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The red circles are polling stations, selected by your criteria. A:",
    "247": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors, like the threat level. A:",
    "248": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, that was government data. A:",
    "249": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some. A:",
    "250": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map. A:",
    "251": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of \"Terrace Theater\" I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. A:",
    "252": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I was not the only person editing the open street map. A:",
    "253": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map. A:",
    "254": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Let's now spin the world during the same year. A:",
    "255": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better. A:",
    "256": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. A:",
    "257": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be. A:",
    "258": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here focusing in on Haiti. A:",
    "259": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be, not as good as the map of California. A:",
    "260": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license, which allowed the open-source community to use it. A:",
    "261": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is January, in time lapse, of people editing ... that's the earthquake. A:",
    "262": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of After the earthquake, immediately, people all over the world, mappers who wanted to help, and could, looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up. A:",
    "263": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince. A:",
    "264": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images]. A:",
    "265": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince. A:",
    "266": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. A:",
    "267": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's the map showing, on the left-hand side, that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship. A:",
    "268": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads, damaged buildings, refugee camps -- it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work]. A:",
    "269": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, if you've been involved in that at all, I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing, whether you've just been chanting, \"Raw data now!\" A:",
    "270": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of or you've been putting government or scientific data online, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much, and we have only just started! A:",
    "271": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Please close your eyes, and open your hands. A:",
    "272": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. A:",
    "273": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now open your eyes. A:",
    "274": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What about a life? A:",
    "275": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What you see here is a premature baby. A:",
    "276": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. A:",
    "277": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. A:",
    "278": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sadly, 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world. A:",
    "279": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Four million of these babies die annually. A:",
    "280": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems. A:",
    "281": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow. A:",
    "282": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q. A:",
    "283": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. A:",
    "284": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That is the primary function of an incubator. A:",
    "285": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars. A:",
    "286": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. A:",
    "287": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of As a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. A:",
    "288": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've seen this firsthand over and over again. A:",
    "289": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani. A:",
    "290": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of She took her baby to the nearest village clinic, and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. A:",
    "291": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died. A:",
    "292": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home. A:",
    "293": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. A:",
    "294": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, this is what we came up with. A:",
    "295": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. A:",
    "296": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. A:",
    "297": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can open it up completely. It's waterproof. A:",
    "298": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. A:",
    "299": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But the magic is in this pouch of wax. A:",
    "300": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a phase-change material. A:",
    "301": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius. A:",
    "302": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch. A:",
    "303": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, you then place it into this little pocket back here, and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby. A:",
    "304": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. A:",
    "305": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We plan to launch this product in India in 2010, and the target price point will be 25 dollars, less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator. A:",
    "306": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. A:",
    "307": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth. A:",
    "308": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This seems counterintuitive, but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced, population sizes also decrease, because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. A:",
    "309": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology: simple, localized, affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact. A:",
    "310": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In designing this we followed a few basic principles. A:",
    "311": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We really tried to understand the end user, in this case, people like Sevitha. A:",
    "312": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists. A:",
    "313": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem. A:",
    "314": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses. A:",
    "315": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace. A:",
    "316": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, basically we have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. A:",
    "317": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork. A:",
    "318": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications. A:",
    "319": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've been simplifying things for 30 years. A:",
    "320": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I come out of the advertising and design business. A:",
    "321": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands. A:",
    "322": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, very quickly, when President Obama said, \"I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement.\" A:",
    "323": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English. A:",
    "324": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. A:",
    "325": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a real thing. A:",
    "326": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, I went one step further and said, \"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document? Let's go online.\" A:",
    "327": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And many people might need help in computation. A:",
    "328": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents. A:",
    "329": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people? A:",
    "330": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. A:",
    "331": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And what about terms like \"over the limit\"? A:",
    "332": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Perhaps a stealth thing. A:",
    "333": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Define it in context. Tell people what it means. A:",
    "334": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk. A:",
    "335": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Plain English is about changing the content. A:",
    "336": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. A:",
    "337": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a grid, it's a calendar. A:",
    "338": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities. A:",
    "339": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Received very favorably by business. A:",
    "340": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there is some good news to report today. A:",
    "341": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. A:",
    "342": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are 200 million letters that go out. A:",
    "343": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible. A:",
    "344": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. A:",
    "345": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English. A:",
    "346": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They have been tested in the laboratory. A:",
    "347": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible. A:",
    "348": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the IRS has introduced the program. A:",
    "349": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. A:",
    "350": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity. A:",
    "351": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We see all this complexity. A:",
    "352": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority. A:",
    "353": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. A:",
    "354": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. A:",
    "355": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, how are we going to change the world? A:",
    "356": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority. A:",
    "357": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I thank you. A:",
    "358": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. A:",
    "359": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. A:",
    "360": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. A:",
    "361": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: There will be too much rain, not enough rain, things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. A:",
    "362": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. A:",
    "363": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, the climate changes will be terrible for them. A:",
    "364": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Also, the price of energy is very important to them. A:",
    "365": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of, to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. A:",
    "366": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, the price of energy has come down over time. A:",
    "367": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. A:",
    "368": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning, we can make modern materials and do so many things. A:",
    "369": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. A:",
    "370": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2. A:",
    "371": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. A:",
    "372": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. A:",
    "373": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are, there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. A:",
    "374": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. A:",
    "375": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? A:",
    "376": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? A:",
    "377": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. A:",
    "378": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so that's a big challenge. A:",
    "379": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's very different than saying \"We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under.\" A:",
    "380": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is something that has to get to zero. A:",
    "381": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons. A:",
    "382": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For each American, it's about 20 tons; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. A:",
    "383": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. A:",
    "384": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. A:",
    "385": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's been constantly going up. A:",
    "386": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero. A:",
    "387": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication: So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. A:",
    "388": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. A:",
    "389": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. A:",
    "390": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look. A:",
    "391": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of First, we've got population. A:",
    "392": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The world today has 6.8 billion people. A:",
    "393": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's headed up to about nine billion. A:",
    "394": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3. A:",
    "395": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The second factor is the services we use. A:",
    "396": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. A:",
    "397": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. A:",
    "398": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it's a great thing for this number to go up. A:",
    "399": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than double the services delivered per person. A:",
    "400": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? A:",
    "401": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. A:",
    "402": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news. A:",
    "403": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We have something that's not going up. A:",
    "404": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. A:",
    "405": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. A:",
    "406": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are other services like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. A:",
    "407": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, overall here, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. A:",
    "408": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. A:",
    "409": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. A:",
    "410": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? A:",
    "411": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you burn coal, no. A:",
    "412": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you burn natural gas, no. A:",
    "413": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. A:",
    "414": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. A:",
    "415": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, we need energy miracles. A:",
    "416": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, when I use the term \"miracle,\" I don't mean something that's impossible. A:",
    "417": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. A:",
    "418": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The Internet and its services are a miracle. A:",
    "419": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. A:",
    "420": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Usually, we don't have a deadline, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. A:",
    "421": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. A:",
    "422": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. A:",
    "423": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, I thought, \"How could I really capture this? A:",
    "424": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?\" A:",
    "425": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos, and somehow people enjoyed that. A:",
    "426": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos. A:",
    "427": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, with energy, all I could come up with is this. A:",
    "428": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. A:",
    "429": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So here we have some natural fireflies. A:",
    "430": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. A:",
    "431": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. A:",
    "432": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability, and, although there's many directions people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. A:",
    "433": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. A:",
    "434": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges. A:",
    "435": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. A:",
    "436": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not, and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. A:",
    "437": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level, but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky, and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue. A:",
    "438": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Who's going to be sure? A:",
    "439": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? A:",
    "440": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a lot of volume. A:",
    "441": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So that's a tough one. A:",
    "442": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Next would be nuclear. A:",
    "443": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It also has three big problems: Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. A:",
    "444": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then what do you do with the waste? A:",
    "445": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. A:",
    "446": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of People need to feel good about it. A:",
    "447": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. A:",
    "448": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The last three of the five, I've grouped together. A:",
    "449": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. A:",
    "450": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. A:",
    "451": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. A:",
    "452": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. A:",
    "453": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Also, these are intermittent sources. A:",
    "454": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. A:",
    "455": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. A:",
    "456": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, we've got big cost challenges here, we have transmission challenges: for example, say this energy source is outside your country; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. A:",
    "457": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, finally, this storage problem. A:",
    "458": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses, and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. A:",
    "459": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. A:",
    "460": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. A:",
    "461": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. A:",
    "462": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. A:",
    "463": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? A:",
    "464": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? A:",
    "465": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds. A:",
    "466": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. A:",
    "467": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, \"They're crazy.\" That's good. A:",
    "468": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. A:",
    "469": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. A:",
    "470": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that. A:",
    "471": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. A:",
    "472": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. A:",
    "473": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. A:",
    "474": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the U235 -- we decided, \"Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238.\" A:",
    "475": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It is kind of a crazy idea. A:",
    "476": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work. A:",
    "477": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. A:",
    "478": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. A:",
    "479": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing. A:",
    "480": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. A:",
    "481": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. A:",
    "482": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. A:",
    "483": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. A:",
    "484": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. A:",
    "485": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. A:",
    "486": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. A:",
    "487": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. A:",
    "488": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? A:",
    "489": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What should our report card look like? A:",
    "490": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. A:",
    "491": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. A:",
    "492": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That really is very important, that we get there. A:",
    "493": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries, still some agriculture, hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. A:",
    "494": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. A:",
    "495": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere? A:",
    "496": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's super important. A:",
    "497": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's a key element of making that report card. A:",
    "498": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? A:",
    "499": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, again, it should have the two elements. A:",
    "500": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and, therefore, the less the temperature. A:",
    "501": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. A:",
    "502": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. A:",
    "503": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. A:",
    "504": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The Al Gore book, \"Our Choice\" and the David McKay book, \"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\" A:",
    "505": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. A:",
    "506": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's a lot that has to come together. A:",
    "507": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So this is a wish. A:",
    "508": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. A:",
    "509": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick. A:",
    "510": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the one with the greatest impact. A:",
    "511": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. A:",
    "512": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, what do we have to do? A:",
    "513": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? A:",
    "514": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We need to go for more research funding. A:",
    "515": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. A:",
    "516": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They should discuss this innovation agenda, and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. A:",
    "517": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there. A:",
    "518": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We need to get the message out. A:",
    "519": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. A:",
    "520": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve. A:",
    "521": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. A:",
    "522": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Thank you. A:",
    "523": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. A:",
    "524": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right -- I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is? A:",
    "525": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of millions, and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. A:",
    "526": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The tough thing is building the pilot reactor; finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. A:",
    "527": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it. A:",
    "528": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? A:",
    "529": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong: that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good. A:",
    "530": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities. A:",
    "531": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. A:",
    "532": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. A:",
    "533": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and burn that. A:",
    "534": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today, that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with. A:",
    "535": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. A:",
    "536": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. A:",
    "537": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? A:",
    "538": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called \"nuclear,\" so we've got a lot of interest, that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China -- I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. A:",
    "539": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work. A:",
    "540": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is a variant on something that has been done. A:",
    "541": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. A:",
    "542": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? A:",
    "543": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. A:",
    "544": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. A:",
    "545": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. A:",
    "546": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. A:",
    "547": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. A:",
    "548": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We certainly need one to succeed. A:",
    "549": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? A:",
    "550": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. A:",
    "551": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. A:",
    "552": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. A:",
    "553": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach. A:",
    "554": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. A:",
    "555": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal, and so -- if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own. A:",
    "556": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: If this doesn't work, then what? A:",
    "557": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? A:",
    "558": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack: Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. A:",
    "559": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. A:",
    "560": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, that's just an insurance policy. A:",
    "561": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You hope you don't need to do that. A:",
    "562": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. A:",
    "563": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? A:",
    "564": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong? A:",
    "565": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. A:",
    "566": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. A:",
    "567": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? A:",
    "568": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. A:",
    "569": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS. A:",
    "570": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. A:",
    "571": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, \"OK, that isn't that big of a deal.\" A:",
    "572": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. A:",
    "573": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, \"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2, but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.\" A:",
    "574": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. A:",
    "575": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic. A:",
    "576": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It shouldn't take away from other things. A:",
    "577": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste. A:",
    "578": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. A:",
    "579": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If the trade-off you get into is, \"Let's make energy super expensive,\" then the rich can afford that. A:",
    "580": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. A:",
    "581": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The disaster is for that two billion. A:",
    "582": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And even Lomborg has changed. A:",
    "583": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of His shtick now is, \"Why isn't the R&amp;D getting more discussed?\" A:",
    "584": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&amp;D point. A:",
    "585": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. A:",
    "586": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The R&amp;D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded. A:",
    "587": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. A:",
    "588": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of BG: Thank you. A:",
    "589": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) About a year ago, I asked myself a question: \"Knowing what I know, why am I not a vegetarian?\" A:",
    "590": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of After all, I'm one of the green guys: I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin. A:",
    "591": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff. A:",
    "592": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third. A:",
    "593": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider for our own cats, dogs and other pets. A:",
    "594": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Environmentally, meat, amazingly, causes more emissions than all of transportation combined: cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it. A:",
    "595": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do. A:",
    "596": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I also knew that I'm not alone. A:",
    "597": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s. A:",
    "598": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So what was once the special little side treat now is the main, much more regular. A:",
    "599": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So really, any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian. A:",
    "600": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk -- tucking into a big old steak. A:",
    "601": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So why was I stalling? A:",
    "602": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution. A:",
    "603": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was either you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian, and I guess I just wasn't quite ready. A:",
    "604": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Imagine your last hamburger. A:",
    "605": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) So my common sense, my good intentions, were in conflict with my taste buds. A:",
    "606": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I'd commit to doing it later, and not surprisingly, later never came. A:",
    "607": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sound familiar? A:",
    "608": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So I wondered, might there be a third solution? A:",
    "609": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I thought about it, and I came up with one. A:",
    "610": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great. A:",
    "611": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's called weekday veg. A:",
    "612": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The name says it all: Nothing with a face Monday through Friday. A:",
    "613": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of On the weekend, your choice. A:",
    "614": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Simple. A:",
    "615": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you want to take it to the next level, remember, the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats. A:",
    "616": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So you want to swap those out with some good, sustainably harvested fish. A:",
    "617": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's structured, so it ends up being simple to remember, and it's okay to break it here and there. A:",
    "618": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of After all, cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake. A:",
    "619": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The program has been great, weekday veg. A:",
    "620": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of My footprint's smaller, I'm lessening pollution, I feel better about the animals, I'm even saving money. A:",
    "621": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Best of all, I'm healthier, I know that I'm going to live longer, and I've even lost a little weight. A:",
    "622": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, please ask yourselves, for your health, for your pocketbook, for the environment, for the animals: What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot? A:",
    "623": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of After all, if all of us ate half as much meat, it would be like half of us were vegetarians. A:",
    "624": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. A:",
    "625": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) So, now, there are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money. A:",
    "626": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, they make their livings on this kind of stuff. A:",
    "627": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me. A:",
    "628": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Started a website back in 2005, with a few friends of mine, called Reddit.com. A:",
    "629": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That's what you'd call a social news website. A:",
    "630": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content, say a TEDTalk, submit it to Reddit, and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it, vote it down if they don't. A:",
    "631": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that creates the front page. It's always rising, falling, always changing. A:",
    "632": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of About a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. A:",
    "633": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web. A:",
    "634": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends get born right on our front page. A:",
    "635": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But this isn't even about Reddit itself. A:",
    "636": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's actually about humpback whales. A:",
    "637": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, okay, technically it's actually about Greenpeace, which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their whaling campaign. A:",
    "638": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These humpback whales were getting killed. A:",
    "639": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They wanted to put an end to it. And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales. A:",
    "640": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But to really kind of personify the movement, they wanted to name it. A:",
    "641": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names. A:",
    "642": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I believe this is a Farsi word for \"immortal.\" A:",
    "643": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I think this means \"divine power of the ocean\" in a Polynesian language. A:",
    "644": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then there was this: Mister Splashy Pants. A:",
    "645": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And this, this was special. Mister Pants, or Splashy, to his friends, was very popular on the Internet. A:",
    "646": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, someone on Reddit thought, \"Oh, what a great thing, we should all vote this up.\" A:",
    "647": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, you know, Redditors responded and all agreed. A:",
    "648": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves. A:",
    "649": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We changed our logo, for the day, from the alien to a Splashy, to sort of help the cause. A:",
    "650": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, \"Yes! We love Splashy Pants.\" A:",
    "651": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started, to 70 percent at the end of voting. A:",
    "652": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Which is pretty impressive right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Hmm, just kidding. Okay. A:",
    "653": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it, because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win. A:",
    "654": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So they said, \"No, no, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.\" A:",
    "655": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, that got us a little angry. A:",
    "656": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. A:",
    "657": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And the Reddit community, really, and the rest of the internet, rather, really got behind this. A:",
    "658": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Facebook groups were getting created. Facebook applications were getting created. A:",
    "659": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The idea was, \"Vote your conscience,\" vote for Mister Splashy Pants. A:",
    "660": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And people were putting up signs in the real world -- (Laughter) -- about this whale. A:",
    "661": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this was the final vote. When all was cleared ... A:",
    "662": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of 78 percent of the votes, and to give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three. Okay? A:",
    "663": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, there was a clear lesson here. A:",
    "664": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. A:",
    "665": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Which is obvious. It's a great name. A:",
    "666": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, \"Mister Splashy Pants.\" A:",
    "667": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And I think that's what helped drive this. A:",
    "668": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was, they created an entire marketing campaign around it. A:",
    "669": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins. A:",
    "670": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. A:",
    "671": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished. A:",
    "672": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Greenpeace was thrilled. The whales were happy. That's a quote. A:",
    "673": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And actually, Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers. A:",
    "674": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A few of them certainly were. But we're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme, and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. A:",
    "675": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But this wasn't really out of altruism. This was just out of interest in doing something cool. A:",
    "676": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is kind of how the Internet works. A:",
    "677": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is that great big secret. Because the Internet provides this level playing field. A:",
    "678": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Your link is just as good as your link, which is just as good as my link. As long as we have a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. A:",
    "679": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. A:",
    "680": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now. A:",
    "681": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are so many great publishing tools that are available, it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something. A:",
    "682": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go. A:",
    "683": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And if you do, be genuine about it. Be honest. Be up front. A:",
    "684": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control. A:",
    "685": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your final goal. A:",
    "686": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online. A:",
    "687": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down. A:",
    "688": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control. A:",
    "689": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. A:",
    "690": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. A:",
    "691": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the idea's pretty simple: Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow. A:",
    "692": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The marshmallow has to be on top. A:",
    "693": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. A:",
    "694": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it into a design workshop. A:",
    "695": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it was a huge success. A:",
    "696": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And since then, I've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the CTOs of the Fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of them with you. A:",
    "697": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. A:",
    "698": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power. A:",
    "699": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. A:",
    "700": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. A:",
    "701": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow, and then they gingerly put it on top, and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! -- they admire their work. A:",
    "702": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But what really happens, most of the time, is that the \"ta-da\" turns into an \"uh-oh,\" because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. A:",
    "703": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So there are a number of people who have a lot more \"uh-oh\" moments than others, and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. A:",
    "704": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) They lie, they cheat, they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. A:",
    "705": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And of course there are teams that have a lot more \"ta-da\" structures, and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. A:",
    "706": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And it's pretty amazing. A:",
    "707": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of As Peter tells us, not only do they produce the tallest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all. A:",
    "708": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So the question you want to ask is: How come? Why? What is it about them? A:",
    "709": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right? A:",
    "710": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They don't spend time jockeying for power. A:",
    "711": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But there's another reason as well. A:",
    "712": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right? A:",
    "713": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then they execute on it. A:",
    "714": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top, they run out of time and what happens? A:",
    "715": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a crisis. A:",
    "716": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sound familiar? Right. A:",
    "717": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, successive prototypes, always keeping the marshmallow on top, so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. A:",
    "718": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. A:",
    "719": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. A:",
    "720": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential, but let's look at how different teams perform. A:",
    "721": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So the average for most people is around 20 inches; business schools students, about half of that; lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that, kindergarteners, better than most adults. A:",
    "722": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Who does the very best? A:",
    "723": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Architects and engineers, thankfully. A:",
    "724": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. A:",
    "725": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. A:",
    "726": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting. A:",
    "727": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you put you put an executive admin. on the team, they get significantly better. A:",
    "728": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, \"Oh, that team's going to win.\" A:",
    "729": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? A:",
    "730": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because they have special skills of facilitation. A:",
    "731": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They manage the process, they understand the process. A:",
    "732": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. A:",
    "733": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. A:",
    "734": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you have 10 teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. A:",
    "735": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I tried something interesting. A:",
    "736": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I thought, let's up the ante, once. A:",
    "737": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team. A:",
    "738": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So what do you think happened to these design students? A:",
    "739": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What was the result? A:",
    "740": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here's what happened: Not one team had a standing structure. A:",
    "741": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken home the prize. A:",
    "742": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes have a strong impact. A:",
    "743": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We did the exercise again with the same students. A:",
    "744": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What do you think happened then? A:",
    "745": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So now they understand the value of prototyping. A:",
    "746": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. A:",
    "747": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. A:",
    "748": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. A:",
    "749": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, you might ask: Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge? A:",
    "750": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the reason is, I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. A:",
    "751": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. A:",
    "752": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? A:",
    "753": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common stance to build the right prototype. A:",
    "754": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, this is the value of the experience, of this so simple exercise. A:",
    "755": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. A:",
    "756": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. A:",
    "757": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's step-by-step instructions on this. A:",
    "758": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. A:",
    "759": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's world records that are on this as well. A:",
    "760": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the fundamental lesson, I believe, is that design truly is a contact sport. A:",
    "761": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task, and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. A:",
    "762": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an \"uh-oh\" moment to a \"ta-da\" moment. A:",
    "763": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that can make a big difference. A:",
    "764": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you very much. A:",
    "765": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. A:",
    "766": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings. A:",
    "767": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. A:",
    "768": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. A:",
    "769": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond, and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. A:",
    "770": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. A:",
    "771": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself. A:",
    "772": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. A:",
    "773": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. A:",
    "774": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. A:",
    "775": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. A:",
    "776": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost. A:",
    "777": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. A:",
    "778": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. A:",
    "779": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) So, I just started playing. A:",
    "780": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. A:",
    "781": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. A:",
    "782": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst. A:",
    "783": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. A:",
    "784": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius. A:",
    "785": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's, from Bart\u00f3k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen. A:",
    "786": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level. A:",
    "787": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. A:",
    "788": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician. A:",
    "789": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Music is medicine. Music changes us. A:",
    "790": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. A:",
    "791": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality. A:",
    "792": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that is an escape from his tormented state. A:",
    "793": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I understood that this was the very essence of art. A:",
    "794": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core, our emotions, and through our artistic lens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality. A:",
    "795": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us. A:",
    "796": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. A:",
    "797": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. A:",
    "798": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. A:",
    "799": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. A:",
    "800": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. A:",
    "801": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Robert Gupta. A:",
    "802": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. A:",
    "803": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, please forgive me. A:",
    "804": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) (Music) (Applause) I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain, which is what we do research on at the University of California. A:",
    "805": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Just think about this problem for a second. A:",
    "806": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds, which you can hold in the palm of your hand. A:",
    "807": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. A:",
    "808": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It can contemplate the meaning of infinity, ask questions about the meaning of its own existence, about the nature of God. A:",
    "809": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. A:",
    "810": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings: How does this all come about? A:",
    "811": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons. A:",
    "812": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We're looking at neurons here. A:",
    "813": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain. A:",
    "814": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain. A:",
    "815": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And based on this, people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. A:",
    "816": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, how do you go about studying the brain? A:",
    "817": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior. A:",
    "818": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is what I spoke about in the last TED. A:",
    "819": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Today I'll talk about a different approach, which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain, and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. A:",
    "820": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. A:",
    "821": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy, in Parma, by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues, is a group of neurons called mirror neurons, which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. A:",
    "822": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain, which have been known for over 50 years. A:",
    "823": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. A:",
    "824": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple, a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. A:",
    "825": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire, commanding me to pull that object. A:",
    "826": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. A:",
    "827": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons, maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action. A:",
    "828": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something, but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. A:",
    "829": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is truly astonishing. A:",
    "830": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view. A:",
    "831": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action. A:",
    "832": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons? A:",
    "833": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. A:",
    "834": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view. A:",
    "835": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, this is important for imitation and emulation. A:",
    "836": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, why is that important? A:",
    "837": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, let's take a look at the next slide. A:",
    "838": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important? A:",
    "839": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation. A:",
    "840": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture. A:",
    "841": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago, let's look at human evolution, it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago. A:",
    "842": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use, the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language, and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpret that person's behavior. A:",
    "843": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of All of that happened relatively quickly. A:",
    "844": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago, 100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly. A:",
    "845": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. A:",
    "846": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations. A:",
    "847": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian. A:",
    "848": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A:",
    "849": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A polar bear, to evolve a coat, will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years. A:",
    "850": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. A:",
    "851": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then once it's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population. A:",
    "852": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. A:",
    "853": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now there is another kind of mirror neuron, which is involved in something quite different. A:",
    "854": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that is, there are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch. A:",
    "855": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In other words, if somebody touches me, my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. A:",
    "856": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. A:",
    "857": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it's empathizing the other person being touched. A:",
    "858": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, most of them will fire when I'm touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. A:",
    "859": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. A:",
    "860": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. A:",
    "861": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched, why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched? A:",
    "862": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch. A:",
    "863": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying \"Don't worry, you're not being touched. A:",
    "864": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, empathize, by all means, with the other person, but do not actually experience the touch, otherwise you'll get confused and muddled.\" A:",
    "865": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Okay, so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. A:",
    "866": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm, so you put an injection into my arm, anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb, and there is no sensations coming in, if I now watch you being touched, I literally feel it in my hand. A:",
    "867": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In other words, you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. A:",
    "868": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons. A:",
    "869": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. A:",
    "870": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of All that's separating you from him, from the other person, is your skin. A:",
    "871": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind. A:",
    "872": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. A:",
    "873": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy, and that is there is no real independent self, aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world, inspecting other people. A:",
    "874": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet, you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. A:",
    "875": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other. A:",
    "876": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. A:",
    "877": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy. A:",
    "878": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. A:",
    "879": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else being touched, you feel it in your phantom. A:",
    "880": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now the astonishing thing is, if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand, massage the other person's hand, that relieves the pain in your phantom hand, almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged. A:",
    "881": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, here you have my last slide. A:",
    "882": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. A:",
    "883": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures: science on the one hand, humanities on the other; never the twain shall meet. A:",
    "884": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness, representation of self, what separates you from other human beings, what allows you to empathize with other human beings, and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization, which is unique to human beings. Thank you. A:",
    "885": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, \"Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.\" A:",
    "886": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. A:",
    "887": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. A:",
    "888": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic trick. A:",
    "889": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. A:",
    "890": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s. A:",
    "891": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it. A:",
    "892": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then I'll explain why I explained it. A:",
    "893": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, here's what happens. A:",
    "894": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine. A:",
    "895": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. A:",
    "896": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'll get my sleeve back. A:",
    "897": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. A:",
    "898": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. A:",
    "899": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the object of this is quite simple. A:",
    "900": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if all is well, my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. A:",
    "901": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it, and the knife does not come off. A:",
    "902": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Nothing goes up or down my sleeve, no trickery. And you can examine everything. A:",
    "903": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Ta-da! A:",
    "904": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic, because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. A:",
    "905": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Probably many of you in the room know this trick. A:",
    "906": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What happens is this. A:",
    "907": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I hold the knife in my hand. A:",
    "908": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve, that is a lie. A:",
    "909": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. A:",
    "910": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this. A:",
    "911": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Nice one. A:",
    "912": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. A:",
    "913": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) So, it goes like this, from here, right. A:",
    "914": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And as I move around my finger shifts. A:",
    "915": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them. A:",
    "916": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up. A:",
    "917": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism, but by chicanery, my index finger being there. A:",
    "918": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. A:",
    "919": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I take this hand away. You give the knife out. A:",
    "920": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. A:",
    "921": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, (Laughter) what does that have to do with the placebo effect? A:",
    "922": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. A:",
    "923": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing. A:",
    "924": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like aspirin shaped -- it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect. A:",
    "925": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill, and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective. A:",
    "926": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills. A:",
    "927": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. A:",
    "928": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out. A:",
    "929": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops. A:",
    "930": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form. A:",
    "931": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. A:",
    "932": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Dosage has something to do with this. A:",
    "933": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. A:",
    "934": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But the point is ... A:",
    "935": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it. A:",
    "936": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the form has something to do with it. A:",
    "937": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And if you want the ultimate in placebo, you've go to the needle. A:",
    "938": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Right? A syringe with some inert -- a couple CCs of some inert something, and you inject this into a patient ... A:",
    "939": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white pill. A:",
    "940": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. A:",
    "941": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. A:",
    "942": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. A:",
    "943": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. A:",
    "944": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. A:",
    "945": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the needle. A:",

    "1068": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was insidious and it was really happening. A:",
    "1069": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Then I decided I had to get really smart, I would take this job in the West Coast. A:",

    "1074": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. A:",
    "1075": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, what's wrong with this picture? A:",
    "1076": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here. A:",
    "1077": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office: They never ask me about my place history. A:",
    "1078": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me, \"Where have you lived?\" A:",
    "1079": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach. A:",

    "1091": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck. A:",
    "1092": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But none of that's in my medical record. A:",
    "1093": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it's not in yours either. A:",
    "1094": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, here's my friend Paul. A:",
    "1095": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours, 24/7, 365 days out of the year for the last two years, everywhere he went. A:",

    "1106": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This might be what we end up with. A:",
    "1107": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right? A:",
    "1108": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This could be my little assessment. A:",
    "1109": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And he looks at that and he says, \"Whoa Bill, I suggest that maybe you not decide, just because you're out here in beautiful California, and it's warm every day, that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. A:",

    "1114": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And they're in the early stages of development. A:",
    "1115": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These programs need to be supported, and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today. A:",
    "1116": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record, we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. A:",
    "1117": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It not only will be important for the physician; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon. A:",
    "1118": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But it will also be useful for us. A:",
    "1119": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I could have made the decision, if I had this information, not to move to the ozone capital of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision. A:",

    "1125": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago. A:",
    "1126": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records. A:",
    "1127": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So with that, I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health: Geography always matters. A:",

    "1211": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, the question is, what does that cost us? A:",

    "1215": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What's that time worth? A:",
    "1216": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. A:",
    "1217": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year. A:",
    "1218": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction. A:",
    "1219": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction. A:",
    "1220": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again. A:",

    "1222": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it makes one wonder, \"Why is it there?\" A:",
    "1223": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction? A:",
    "1224": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal? A:",
    "1225": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. A:",
    "1226": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. A:",
    "1227": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Can that be accomplished with existing signs? A:",
    "1228": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. A:",
    "1229": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Stop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got. A:",
    "1230": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, why not use a yield sign? A:",
    "1231": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way. A:",
    "1232": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating, or taking turns, and it's always on the minor road, allowing the major one to have primacy. A:",
    "1233": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. A:",
    "1234": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, \"OK, remember what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different.\" A:",
    "1235": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of That would not work. A:",
    "1236": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, what the world needs now is a new type of sign. A:",
    "1237": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) So, you'd have a little instruction below it, you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements. A:",
    "1238": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. A:",
    "1239": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns. A:",
    "1240": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And uncertainty results in caution. A:",
    "1241": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. A:",
    "1242": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, now that you are all \"Road Scholars\" ... A:",
    "1243": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly. A:",
    "1244": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But you all are members of communities, and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. A:",
    "1245": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. A:",
    "1246": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears, these are the dancing bears. A:",
    "1247": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. A:",
    "1248": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. A:",
    "1249": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India, and have been in India since the 13th century. A:",
    "1250": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We went about getting evidence of what was going on. A:",
    "1251": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. A:",
    "1252": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we went in, pretending to be buyers. A:",
    "1253": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka. A:",
    "1254": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. A:",
    "1255": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and they are used for bear paw soup, and also being trained, later on, to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. A:",
    "1256": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. A:",
    "1257": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The couple are barely 18 years old. A:",
    "1258": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They already have four children beside them. You can see them. A:",
    "1259": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. A:",
    "1260": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. A:",
    "1261": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper, we found that it's an illegal act. A:",
    "1262": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. A:",
    "1263": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. A:",
    "1264": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was unacceptable. A:",
    "1265": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The mother bears are usually killed. A:",
    "1266": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The cubs, which are taken, are separated. A:",
    "1267": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. A:",
    "1268": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. A:",
    "1269": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood, to getting something else. A:",
    "1270": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment. A:",
    "1271": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we were so unsure that this would work. A:",
    "1272": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. A:",
    "1273": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we said, \"Okay, here is some seed fund. A:",
    "1274": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Let's see if you can get something else.\" And we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. A:",
    "1275": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway. A:",
    "1276": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He has a telephone booth. A:",
    "1277": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then it started, there was no turning back after that. A:",
    "1278": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear. A:",
    "1279": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near Agra. A:",
    "1280": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Then there was no looking back at all for us. A:",
    "1281": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We gave cycle rickshaws. A:",
    "1282": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We set up carpet-weaving units, vocational training for the women. A:",
    "1283": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that. A:",
    "1284": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Education. The kids never went to school. A:",
    "1285": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They only had Islamic education, very little of it. A:",
    "1286": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. A:",
    "1287": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today. A:",
    "1288": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. A:",
    "1289": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Of course we also had to get the bears in. A:",
    "1290": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is what happens to the bears when they come in. A:",
    "1291": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And this is what we turn them into. A:",
    "1292": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. A:",
    "1293": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears. A:",
    "1294": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We rescued over 550 dancing bears. A:",
    "1295": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. A:",
    "1296": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India, into our rescue center. A:",
    "1297": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. A:",
    "1298": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the people can hold their heads up high. A:",
    "1299": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. A:",
    "1300": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. A:",
    "1301": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there will be no more removing of these bears. A:",
    "1302": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the children, both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you. A:",
    "1303": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) First of all, I'm a geek. A:",
    "1304": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'm an organic food-eating, carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek. A:",
    "1305": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things. A:",
    "1306": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so I have to figure this out for myself. A:",
    "1307": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of For example: Is this evil? A:",
    "1308": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up. A:",
    "1309": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter) The answer to this can be found in embodied energy. A:",
    "1310": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water, and every time I use a paper towel, I am using this much virtual energy and water. A:",
    "1311": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Wipe it up, throw it away. A:",
    "1312": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times, I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel. A:",
    "1313": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is now operating energy. A:",
    "1314": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So if I throw my towel in the washing machine, I've now put energy and water back into that towel ... A:",
    "1315": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter) and then it looks a little bit better. A:",
    "1316": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets? A:",
    "1317": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, now a paper towel looks better. A:",
    "1318": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge. A:",
    "1319": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water, and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water. A:",
    "1320": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on, and then you start to use more energy. A:",
    "1321": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Or worse, you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel. A:",
    "1322": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And now all bets are off. A:",
    "1323": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize. A:",
    "1324": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house. A:",
    "1325": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) That's what my husband and I are doing right now. A:",
    "1326": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be? A:",
    "1327": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs. A:",
    "1328": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. A:",
    "1329": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels. A:",
    "1330": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We wanted to know how much better we could do. A:",
    "1331": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom. A:",
    "1332": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So first, we demolish it. A:",
    "1333": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart, you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back. A:",
    "1334": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent. A:",
    "1335": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar. A:",
    "1336": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete. A:",
    "1337": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We then put in framing. A:",
    "1338": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so this is framing -- lumber, composite materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC-certified lumber. A:",
    "1339": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising. A:",
    "1340": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there. A:",
    "1341": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose. A:",
    "1342": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We then put in plumbing, electrical and HVAC, and insulate. A:",
    "1343": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy, and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that. A:",

    "1348": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Except for flooring. A:",
    "1349": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you put carpeting in your house, it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house, unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy. A:",
    "1350": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. A:",
    "1351": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But before we pat ourselves too much on the back, we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before. A:",
    "1352": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so the question is: How could we make that back? A:",
    "1353": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward, compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house, we make it back in about six years. A:",
    "1354": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient, and in that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even. A:",
    "1355": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy, it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house. A:",
    "1356": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So what does this mean? A:",
    "1357": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year, it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian. A:",

    "1362": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Thank you. (Applause) I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. A:",
    "1363": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything, but I'd already finished editing the piece, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word \"disabled\" to see what I'd find. A:",
    "1364": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Let me read you the entry. A:",
    "1365": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of \"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked, stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated, run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped, senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in cracked-up, counted-out; see also hurt, useless and weak.

    "1367": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing, it was so ludicrous, but I'd just gotten past \"mangled,\" and my voice broke, and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. A:",
    "1368": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? A:",
    "1369": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s, when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. A:",
    "1370": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. A:",
    "1371": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. A:",
    "1372": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting. A:",

    "1374": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Unfortunately, it's not much better. A:",
    "1375": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I find the last two words under \"Near Antonyms,\" particularly unsettling: \"whole\" and \"wholesome.\" A:",
    "1376": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it's not just about the words. A:",
    "1377": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. A:",
    "1378": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values. A:",
    "1379": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. A:",
    "1380": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans, believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful, because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. A:",
    "1381": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, what reality do we want to call into existence: a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered? A:",
    "1382": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child, we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. A:",
    "1383": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? A:",
    "1384": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. A:",
    "1385": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of His name was Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian American, whose name, apparently, was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. A:",
    "1386": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. A:",
    "1387": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. A:",
    "1388": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors, you know -- to help build up my leg muscles, and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them, had names for them. I hated them. A:",
    "1389": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child, with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises, unsuccessfully, of course. A:",
    "1390": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, one day, he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions -- and he said to me, \"Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those bands. A:",
    "1391": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.\" A:",
    "1392": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. A:",
    "1393": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future. A:",
    "1394": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. A:",
    "1395": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want, the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. A:",
    "1396": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology. A:",
    "1397": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Certainly, from a medical standpoint, my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment, titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities, and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves, so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. A:",
    "1398": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth: that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. A:",
    "1399": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and I'm going to make an admission: This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why. A:",
    "1400": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Implicit in this phrase of \"overcoming adversity\" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability. A:",
    "1401": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge, whether physically, emotionally or both. A:",
    "1402": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. A:",
    "1403": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. A:",
    "1404": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's part of our life. A:",
    "1405": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I tend to think of it like my shadow. A:",
    "1406": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me. A:",
    "1407": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle. A:",
    "1408": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There is adversity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity, but how you're going to meet it. A:",
    "1409": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them to meet it well. A:",
    "1410": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. A:",
    "1411": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. A:",
    "1412": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. A:",
    "1413": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis, or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. A:",
    "1414": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. A:",
    "1415": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of By not treating the wholeness of a person, by not acknowledging their potency, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. A:",
    "1416": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. A:",
    "1417": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. A:",
    "1418": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. A:",
    "1419": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. A:",
    "1420": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, to use a wrestling term, maybe even dancing with it. A:",
    "1421": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful, we're less burdened by the presence of it. A:",
    "1422": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character. A:",
    "1423": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent that survives; it is the one that is most adaptable to change. A:",
    "1424": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Conflict is the genesis of creation. A:",
    "1425": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. A:",
    "1426": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill. A:",
    "1427": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of. A:",
    "1428": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Maybe that's what adversity gives us: a sense of self, a sense of our own power. A:",
    "1429": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, we can give ourselves a gift. A:",
    "1430": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. A:",
    "1431": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Maybe we can see it as change. A:",
    "1432": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. A:",
    "1433": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. A:",
    "1434": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Now, who's normal? A:",
    "1435": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's no normal. A:",
    "1436": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's common, there's typical. There's no normal, and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed? A:",
    "1437": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) I don't think so. A:",
    "1438": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children, and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. A:",
    "1439": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use, to be able to contribute. A:",
    "1440": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago, carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. A:",
    "1441": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They didn't view these people as broken and useless; they were seen as rare and valuable. A:",
    "1442": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. A:",
    "1443": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was summertime: I had shorts on. A:",
    "1444": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, \"Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.\" A:",
    "1445": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. A:",
    "1446": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I said, \"I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you.\" A:",
    "1447": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He said, \"Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me. A:",
    "1448": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.\" A:",
    "1449": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) Oh, that guy. A:",
    "1450": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, but of course, actually, it did click. A:",
    "1451": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. A:",
    "1452": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. A:",
    "1453": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. A:",
    "1454": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He said to me, \"I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since.\" A:",
    "1455": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Laughter) (Applause) The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade spelling bee, marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade, winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories, and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students, med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. A:",
    "1456": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And he called this part of the course the X Factor, the potential of the human will. A:",
    "1457": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. A:",
    "1458": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And Dr. Kean went on to tell me, he said, \"In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise, and even if given a modicum of support, if left to their own devices, a child will achieve.\" A:",
    "1459": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. A:",
    "1460": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. A:",
    "1461": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. A:",
    "1462": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. A:",
    "1463": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure. A:",
    "1464": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. A:",
    "1465": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. A:",
    "1466": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of See, all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off. A:",
    "1467": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educating them in the best sense. A:",
    "1468": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. A:",
    "1469": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In fact, the exact meaning of the word \"educate\" comes from the root word \"educe.\" A:",
    "1470": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It means \"to bring forth what is within, to bring out potential.\" A:",
    "1471": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So again, which potential do we want to bring out? A:",
    "1472": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of There was a case study done in 1960s Britain, when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. A:",
    "1473": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's called the streaming trials. We call it \"tracking\" here in the States. A:",
    "1474": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on. A:",
    "1475": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the \"A students\" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc. A:",
    "1476": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Well, they took, over a three-month period, D-level students, gave them A's, told them they were \"A's,\" told them they were bright, and at the end of this three-month period, they were performing at A-level. A:",
    "1477": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study, is that they took the \"A students\" and told them they were \"D's.\" A:",
    "1478": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period. A:",
    "1479": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out. A:",
    "1480": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. A:",
    "1481": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. A:",
    "1482": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of They were simply told, \"These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'\" And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. A:",
    "1483": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit, a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope, it doesn't see beauty, it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. A:",
    "1484": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power well. A:",
    "1485": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. A:",
    "1486": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called \"The God Who Only Knows Four Words\": \"Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me.

    "1487": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'\" Thank you. A:",
    "1488": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of (Applause) I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things. A:",
    "1489": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. A:",
    "1490": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I became one of the working homeless. A:",
    "1491": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel. A:",
    "1492": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of His death hit me pretty hard. A:",
    "1493": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that. A:",
    "1494": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. A:",
    "1495": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things. A:",
    "1496": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person. A:",
    "1497": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it. A:",
    "1498": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle. A:",
    "1499": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of At first, living in the van was great. A:",
    "1500": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. A:",
    "1501": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I had time to relax and to grieve. A:",
    "1502": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. A:",

    "1504": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. A:",
    "1505": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And it became impossible to park anywhere -- (Laughs) -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot. A:",
    "1506": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The cat came and went through an open window in the van. A:",
    "1507": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The doggy went into doggy day care. A:",

    "1643": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints, to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use the land. A:",
    "1644": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And to me this was a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. A:",

    "1646": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of Because that is what has changed, is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. A:",
    "1647": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. A:",
    "1648": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground, refinement. And that's one chapter. A:",
    "1649": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities, our cars, our motorcultures, where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. A:",
    "1650": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end, where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes -- where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up? A:",
    "1651": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And to me, again, photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world, and find those places. A:",
    "1652": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material? A:",
    "1653": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It was 23 metric tons for one liter. A:",
    "1654": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So whenever I fill up my gas, I think of that liter, and how much carbon. A:",
    "1655": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. A:",

    "1660": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves, only gives us about 45 years. A:",
    "1661": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil will come upon us. A:",
    "1662": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of So, to me, using photography -- and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents, our ways of thinking, to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal with our energy crisis. A:",
    "1663": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, \"We did everything we possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time.

    "1672": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. A:",
    "1673": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter. A:",
    "1674": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. A:",

    "1676": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying. A:",

    "1681": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny. A:",
    "1682": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I will now, here, onstage, try to predict when that will happen -- that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world, as it used to be, over thousands of years. A:",
    "1683": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India, in China, will reach that of the West. A:",
    "1684": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of And I don't mean the whole economy, because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. -- that's a piece of cake, with one billion people. A:",
    "1685": "Q: What is the Indonesian translation of But I want to see when will the average pay, the money for each person, per month, in India and China, when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States? A:",
